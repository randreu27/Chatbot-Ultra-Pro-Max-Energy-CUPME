July 2020The Challenges Facing Adoption of 
Digitalization in O&G
•Culture Change
•Today’s best practices will not be tomorrow’s
•Opportunity lies between the silos
•Failing is good –start small, learn, correct fast
•The risk is not in failing, it is in doing nothing
•Cyber Security
•Yes, but like HSE it can be managed
•Data Privacy
•What data can't you share 
•…..rather than what data canyou share
•Customer -Supplier Business Model
•Transition from procurement to performance 
based partnerships

July 2020Enabling the Digital Transformation
Culture change must lead Technology change
People are at 
the core of 
digital 
transformation
Seed the organization with change 
agentsCommunicate a clear
change story, why & howLearn through PoCs and pilots before 
full implementation
Adapt to process changes and 
empower people with new skillsSet up an integrated project &

Control class 1 : Package control is 
fully integrated into the ICSS and 
implemented utilising standard ICSS 
software and hardware
Control class 2 :Packages use their 
own controller hardware and software, 
with an interface to the ICSS with a 
subset of control signals. Control class 2 
needs a “translator” in one of the ICSS 
nodes to display package data and 
alarms in the ICSS HMI

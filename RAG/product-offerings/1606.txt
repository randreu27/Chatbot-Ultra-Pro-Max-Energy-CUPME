© 2023 Siemens Energy Page 11. Global trends on PFAS: 
timely action needed now
There is a worldwide trend to trace poly -and perfluoroalkyl 
substances, so -called PFAS (also known as ‘forever 
chemicals’), in the environment, prevent their use and find 
alternatives. When released into the atmosphere, water or 
soil, these chemicals can accumulate in organisms and the 
environment. In accordance with the National Academies 
of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, PFAS exposure is 
linked to increased risk of decreased antibody response, 
dyslipidemia (abnormal high cholesterol), decreased infant 
and fetal growth, and increased risk of kidney cancer [1]. 
In 2021, U.S. state Maine banned these compounds in all 
products by 2030, except in instances deemed "currently 
unavoidable" [2][3]. Plans to fight against PFAS pollution 
have also already been launched by the Australian and US 
authorities in 2020 and 2021, [4][5][6]. In Europe, the 
European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) submitted in February 
2023 its restriction proposal for a comprehensive list of 
PFAS [7]. For PFAS F -gases used in switchgear, a ban is foreseen for voltage levels ≤ 145 kV in 2026/27 and for
> 145 kV in 2033. 
In 2022, a well known PFAS manufacturer also announced 
the following actions: 
•exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 
including PFAS F -gases used in switchgear
•work to discontinue use of PFAS across their product 
portfolio by the end of 2025.
This announcement was made after careful considerations 
and a thorough evaluation of the evolving external 
landscape, including multiple factors such as accelerating 
regulatory trends focused on reducing or eliminating the 
presence of PFAS in the environment.
Meanwhile, another piece of legislation, the EU F -Gas 
Regulation, regulates fluorinated gases (F -gases) based on 
their global warming potential (GWP). Some F -gases also 
fall under the category of PFAS, yet their negative effects 
on health and the environment are notcovered by the F -
Gas Regulation [8].Five reasons to avoid PFAS F -gases in

2. Phasing out of PFAS F -gases in 
switchgear is feasible
In 2014, the high greenhouse gas potential of SF6led the 
EU to ban the use of this gas for most applications –except 
for the electricity sector due to a lack of alternatives. Since 
then, new F -gas-free (and PFAS -free) technologies have 
been developed for the high voltage (HV) sector.
These natural -origin gases technologies are available for all 
voltage levels and are gradually being introduced in the HV 
sector. With more than ten years of operational experience, 
they are in development, production and operational use 
for up to voltages of 420 kV with zero direct emissions 
[11]. 
Although these clean alternatives already exist, some 
operators still use fluoronitrile /C4F7N, an insulating F -gas 
for HV and medium voltage (MV) equipment which also 
falls under the category of PFAS.
3. Environment, health and 
safety in transmission & 
distribution equipment ensured
In order to handle PFAS F -(insulation) gases in gas 
production and subsequent handling, clear information is 
needed on the carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic 
(bio-accumulative/CMR) effects of the new insulation gas 
C4F7N, but these are currently not fully known [12]. 
Several tests have been performed to investigate the 
impact of C4F7N on health [13] [14][15]. For example, 
recent toxicological tests indicate that highly concentrated 
exposure to C4F7N provokes neurological issues like 
memory alterations and brain toxicity on mice, weeks after 
exposure [16]. 
Inhalation and skin contact are also categorized as harmful 
(CLP criteria, acute tox. cat. 4, [17]), leaving grounds for 
concern.  
In addition to the health effects of using C4F7N, there are 
environmental concerns. During long -term testing with 
gas-insulated HV switchgear, decomposition products 
which are classified as hazardous, and toxic were formed 
They were formed by C4F7N in combination with gas 
moisture and are classified as hazardous and toxic [18].
Additionally, 100% C4F7N is also known to be a hazard 
when dissolved into water (WGK 2, AwSV , [19]). 
The unwanted release of PFAS F -gases (e.g., intentional 
destruction or internal arcing) can lead to an accumulation 
in soil, when bound with water. If the release of these 
gases is caused by or linked to hot temperatures, the gas component C4F7N may be dissociated and even more toxic 
components like HF and TFA (hydrofluoric acid, 
equivalency factor for trifluoroacetic acid [13]) may occur. 
Therefore, precautions and handling procedures, similar to
those for used SF6gas and decomposition products should 
be recommended for C4F7N. 
‘Clean Air technology’ using natural -origin gases is the best 
way to provide and guarantee safe equipment handling for 
researchers, equipment operators or maintenance 
personnel.
4. Clean air and natural -origin 
gases will be the future of global 
electricity grids
Siemens Energy and other original equipment 
manufacturers (OEM) have developed sustainable non -
toxic alternatives to SF6and PFAS F -gases which are based 
on natural -origin gases (O2, N2, CO2) [20]. These 
alternatives are simple to manage and are reliable and safe. 
They lead to no emissions, no additional upstream 
production of F -gases, PFAS F -gases and CO2, low handling 
costs and no health risks to workers and to the public 
through contamination of air, water, or soil.  
Innovations like these will allow us to achieve Europe’s 
promised carbon neutrality target by 2050.
5. Consequences of our actions 
In order to meet global climate goals, next steps must be 
carefully considered. Decisions taken today should take a 
long -term approach.  Technologies intended to be used for 
the next 40 -60 years, should not pose any risk to health 
and the environment. It is not sustainable to continue to 
rely on PFAS F -gases like C4F7N that will never lead to CO2
neutrality. This would run contrary to EU climate law and 
would be counterproductive as these technologies will 
inevitably need to be replaced in the foreseeable future 
due to increasingly stringent environmental regulations.  
Therefore, we should move ahead with a clean and 
climate -neutral solution for switchgear, which is only 
possible with natural -origin gases.

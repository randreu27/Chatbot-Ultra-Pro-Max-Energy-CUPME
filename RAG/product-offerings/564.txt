Read more Ocean Green​ Hybrid combined cycle power and propulsion plant​ Ocean Green is a new low emission power and propulsion system for large ships, cruises liners, Ro-Pax, container vessels, bulk carriers, LNG carriers, FSRUs and many more. An innovative hybrid combined cycle power and propulsion plant utilizing gas turbine as the main engine in combination with steam turbine and energy storage for propulsion and electrical distribution, AC or DC distribution systems according to specific ship application. ​ Increased cargo/passenger capacity is enabled by the compact engine room and significantly reduced consumables, offering a power to volume/weight ratio that is highly improved compared with existing propulsion systems. The compact propulsion system allows for hydrodynamic hull optimization, a slenderer stern, larger propeller diameter, reduced propeller RPM, hence further improved fuel consumption and reduced emissions.   ​ Ocean Green is future proofed; it can burn carbon neutral fuel and make it a zero-emission vessel without any major midlife upgrade. Maritime fuel cell systems​ In today's rapidly evolving world, the need for decarbonization across various industries has become more pressing than ever. Fuel cells present a compelling solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime industry due to their capability to generate electricity without releasing harmful pollutants. Fuel cells can provide zero emissions, versatility, the ability to integrate with renewable energy sources, compliance with industry regulations, and economic viability​. Submarine PEM fuel cells​ The PEM fuel cell is ideally suited for use as an air-independent power supply for submarines. It enables dive times to be significantly extended, which minimizes the risk of detection.​ Methanol HTPEM fuel cells​ Methanol high-temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cells efficiently convert methanol into electricity and heat, offering a versatile and reliable power solution with reduced emissions for various applications.​ Hydrogen LTPEM fuel cells​ Low-temperature proton exchange membrane (LT-PEM) fuel cells generate electricity through the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen at relatively low operating temperatures, providing efficient and clean power for a wide range of applications​. Battery Energy Storage (BESS) BlueVault™ is the energy storage solution designed specifically for the maritime industry. It provides reliable, high-performance energy storage that enhances the efficiency and sustainability of marine operations. BlueVault™ systems are ideal for a wide range of applications, including hybrid and fully electric propulsion systems, enabling significant reductions in fuel consumption and emissions.

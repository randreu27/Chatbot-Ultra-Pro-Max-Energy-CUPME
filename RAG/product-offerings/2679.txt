recover from atotal orpartial shutdown .”
“Black grid restoration -istheprocedure tore-energize
theblack grid(orgridportions), providing also energy for
other power -plants sothey canstart-up”Intended Benefits Initial Situation
Technical benefits:
▪Availability to start –up the power plant without an 
external power source of supply,
▪Capability to help to restore power to the grid in the event 
of a total or partial shutdown of the national grid,
▪Provision of start up power to other power stations as the 
system restoration progresses,
Commercial benefits:
▪Additional revenues received directly from the TSOs can 
help to
▪increase plant profitability
▪avoid plant closedown through additional 
functionality and revenue opportunities
▪Mitigation of huge production losses by blackouts and 
equipment unavailability.Modern Energy Systems are being influenced by the 
reduction of nuclear and fossil power generation as well as 
the increase of renewable power generation. 
This can cause stability problems in the HV -grid (Reduction 
of short circuit power / inertia and voltage dips stability) 
which might result in a blackout.
Power stations with black start capabilities are required.
By using an independent power source to restore the plant 
auxiliary systems without an external source of supply like:
•Small Open Cycle turbines
•Gas Engine Generators
•Diesel Generators
•Batteries and Hybrid Solutions
With a feasibility study, perform an assessment on the main 
generator capabilities and grid requirements.
Integrate the new power source into the power plant and 
necessary modifications tothe existing installation.

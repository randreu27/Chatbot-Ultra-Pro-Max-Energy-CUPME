approach for 
carbon capture. 
With oxyfuel combustion, the fuel 
is not burned with combustion air 
but with pure oxygen, leading to a 
high CO2 concentration in the flue gas. 
This avoids the requirement for a separation 
and capture unit downstream. However, 
oxygen production and costs upstream of 
the process are important to consider in this 
scenario. 
If a green hydrogen plant is nearby the 
CO2 capture application, renewable oxygen 
produced via electrolysis can be captured 
and compressed, potentially reducing up­
front costs and overall carbon emissions. 
Integrally geared compressors 
Focusing on CO2 compression, Siemens 
Energy has built and executed multiple 
CO2 compression units based on integrally 
geared, single-shaft, and reciprocating 
compressor technology. 
Integrally geared compressors (IGCs), as 
shown in Figure 1, provide several 
advantages in CO2 applications, particularly 
when it comes to energy efficiency and 
CAPEX. 
IGCs provide the advantage of 
intercooling after each stage, as each 
impeller sits within its own volute casing. 
This has important implications for CCUS 
applications, as the high molecular weight 
of CO2 leads to a comparably high head and 
pressure rise per stage, which results in a 
commensurate temperature increase and 
volume reduction per stage versus lighter 
gases. Lowering the temperature in between 
stages via intercooling mitigates this effect, 
reducing isentropic power requirements. 
Additionally, because each stage can be 
designed individually, the impeller diameter 
can be reduced to counteract the shrinking 
flow coefficient due to the decrease in 
volume flow. The adjustability of the pinion 
speeds can also counteract the impeller tip 
speed reduction caused by a reduction in 
impeller diameter. The end result is higher 
polytropic stage efficiencies versus

compressors 
and a need 
for fewer 
stages. 
For a typical CO2 
application where 
compression is required to 
bring the gas from atmospheric 
to pipeline pressure, the number of 
stages can be reduced by as much as 50%. 
Another advantage of the individual stage 
design is that multiple compression jobs 
can be combined in the same machine. 
As an example, CO2 pipeline compression 
can be combined with mechanical vapor 
recompression, which is required for some 
capture processes. 
Siemens Energy's IGCs allow for as many 
as eight stages, with discharge pressures 
up to 250 bar (Figure 2). lntercooling is 
possible after every stage. If required, one 
or more single shaft turbocompressors or 
reciprocating compressors can be installed 
downstream of the IGC to achieve discharge 
pressures of )500 bar. IGCs are suitable with 
any driver technology, including steam or 
gas turbines, or electric motors. Another 
notable advantage IGCs provide is the ability 
to recover waste heat generated during 
compression in between stages. The heat 
can then be reused for the capture process 
or some district heating, reducing OPEX and 
carbon footprint of the application. 
Siemens Energy has developed a 
novel IGC system that achieves this by 
operating the compressor at a slightly 
higher temperature level. For a typical 
amine system, 60-80% of the required steam and heat energy can be met, while 
only requiring between 1/4 and 1/6 of that 
heat as additional mechanical power for 
the compressor at comparable CAPEX 
and footprint. The resulting Coefficient of 
Performance (COP) is between 4.0 -6.0, 
reducing the specific energy demand per 
ton of CO2 captured by up to 1.3 GJ/t. 
The company was recently selected 
to supply two IGC packages for the first 
large-scale direct air capture (OAC) plant in 
the world in Texas' Permian Basin. The plant 
with feature a motor-driven 13,000 hp fully 
modular wet gas compressor package and a 
motor-driven 8,500 hp dry gas compressor. 
The equipment will compress the captured 
CO2 for additional processing and pressurize 
the final product into a pipeline for injection 
into underground reservoirs. The two 
compressor packages will enable the plant 
to capture up to 500,000 metric tons of CO2 
per year when fully operational. 
Other technologies 
Single-shaft turbocompressors and 
reciprocating are also suitable for CO2 
applications. 
Reciprocating CO2 compressors are 
typically used in applications with low 
flows and very high discharge pressures. 
Siemens Energy's units, for example, can 
achieve discharge pressures )850 bar for 
lubricated service and > 100 bar for non­
lubricated service. They exhibit turndown 
capabilities up to 85% (difference between 
minimum handleable flow and design flow) 
and can maintain high efficiency over a 
wide operating range, as pistons can be 
flexibly turned on and off during operation.

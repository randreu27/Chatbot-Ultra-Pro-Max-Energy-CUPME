•The customer's turbine operating parameters have changed. A new footprint turbine needs 
to operate at a higher exhaust pressure, helping the customer meet their carbon reduction 
goals.Customer Challenge
Customer Value 
•Higher  exhaust pressure increases steam consumption, increases plant efficiency by 1%, and 
avoids approximately 20,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year. 
•Exhaust flange was kept even when exhaust pressure increased from 4.2 to 13.2 kg/cm² .
•Outage time was minimized with drop -in unit matching the existing foundation and nozzle locations.
•Improved availability with all new internals, including a new trip and throttle valve.
•2-years ROI.
Scope 
•New Worthington footprint casing
•Steam path designed with 1 stage versus 2 stages 
•New Gimpel  valve - Oil-Operated Trip and Throttle Valve (OOTTV)
•New protection and control system (Protech GII and WW505 governor)

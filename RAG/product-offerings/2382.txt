  B. Product Specification for HOSS Frames  
   1.0 Frame Configuration - Multi-throw, balanced-opposed rigid cast gray iron frame is heavily 
ribbed for strength and reinforced wi th integrally cast on crosshead 
extensions.  The open frame top construction contains (2) two 
steel  tie rods and individually fitted cast gray iron spacers per pair 
of compressor throw.  The two tie rods are located at the ends of 
the crank throw bay, one over each main bearing.  Gasketed 
covers, on top of each bay, at the ends of the frame, and on both sides of each frame extention permit easy access to all the internal 
running gear components.  The inside of the frame is painted with 
an oil proof white primer paint.  The lower flat bottom part of the frame forms the sump for lubricating oil.. 
 
    Options - Explosion relief device (Bicera Relief Valve)      Dry sump configuration 
     Frame liquid level controller 
     Temperature control valve      Lifting lugs (Standard on Export only)

   2.0 Crankshaft Configuration - Forged, alloy st eel crankshafts contain rifle-drilled oil passages for 
pressurized bearing lubrication.  Crankshafts are a one-piece 
design with a straight shaft on the drive end.  Both two and four 
throw crankshafts have shrunk-on counterweights to reduce horizontal foreces and moments. 
 
   3.0 Connecting Rod Configuration - Forged alloy st eel rods are 2-piece construction that are held in 
place by dowel pins and assembled with (4) four forged ferry head 
capscrews with rolled threads.  The connecting rod incorporates a 
rifle-drilled square beam cross-sect ion to allow pressurized oil 
lubrication to the crosshead pin and shoes. 
    4.0 Crosshead and Crosshead Pin  
    Configuration - Nodular iron box ty pe crossheads contain two shim adjustable 
aluminum shoes, one each on top and bottom.  The crosshead pin is a semi-floating hardened steel cylindrical type secured in place 
by bolted on end plates. 
      Where required, positive-lo ck disc-type balance weights can be 
bolted to the crosshead nose for reciprocating balancing of 
opposing throws within (2) two pounds maximum. 
 
   5.0 Distance Piece - 
    Configuration - One piece cast iron design with one compartment distance piece 
contains pilot locating fits and is bolted to the frame.  The inside of 
the compartment is painted with an oil proof white primer paint.  
The distance piece compartment, sealed to 25 psig, is 16.00 inches long meaning that the assembled packing case (less 
flange) can pass easily through either side access opening.  Cast iron wiper rings and Teflon Â® sealing rings are incorporated into the 
packing case.  Two gasketed solid covers, one per side, provide 
for easy maintenance of the crosshead and packing case assemblies.  Stainless steel fitti ngs with either stainless steel 
braided hose, tubing or a combination thereof.   
 
           Options - Single long 22" distance piece similar to 16". 
      Purged wiper assembly and purged packing assembly are 
required to positively ensure that the gas will not migrate from the 
cylinder to the frame. 
 
     Distance piece supports.

   6.3  Connecting Rod 
           Crankpin Brg. - Horizontally split, precision steel backed copper tin lead shell 
bearing with a micro-babbitt overlay and pressurized oil 
lubrication, same bearing as main bearing. 
    6.4  Connecting Rod 
           Bushing - One piece solid bronze helical grooved bushing with micro-babbitt 
overlay, interference fit that has been shrunk into place. 
 
  7.0 Frame Lubrication 
    7.1 Oil Pump - A positive displacement gear pump is internally mounted on the 
frame end cover and direct driven off of the crankshaft by a dowel 
and hub arrangement.  The pump is complete with an adjustable FullFlo external pressure regulating valve for cold start protection.  
An hand-operated oil-priming pump is optional.   
          Option - Full capacity electric motor driven auxiliary oil pump for prelube.   
 
   7.2 Oil Piping - Carbon steel, seamless or welded schedule 40 pipe with threaded 
or non-threaded unions and stainless steel tubing and fittings.  The 
piping between oil filter and oil header is stainless steel. 
 
         Option - All stainless steel seamless or welded schedule 40 pipe.  
    7.3 Oil Filter - Frame mounted 10 micron full-flow oil filter with cartridge-type 
disposable elements.  Cartridges have a collapse rating of 100-psi 
differential pressure. 
 
         Option - Dual oil filter with transfer valve (shipped loose) 
    7.4 Oil Cooler - Fixed bundle shell a nd tube water-cooled oil cooler.  Steel shell 
(housing), carbon steel tube sheets welded to shell, 4 pass design 
with cast iron bonnets, seamless admiralty tubes 25 BWG, 3/8", 
and oil in shell. 
 
                Option - Tema C  
   7.5 Oil Heater (Optional) - Immersion oil heater s available for each of t he frames. For (4) four 
and (6) six throw frames, circulation type heaters are 
recommended (packager supplied).  Standard is 440/480 volt, 3 
phase.

    8.0 Crankshaft Seal Assembly - Prevents oil leak age from frame.  Assembly of the seal consists of 
a split oil slinger ring clamped on the crankshaft along with a lip seal pressed into the fram e end cover around the crankshaft. 
 
    9.0 Tool Kit -  Consists of crosshead nut wrench, piston rod entering sleeve and 
piston nut adapter.  One provided per frame. 
 
   10.0 Cleaning and Painting - All castings are shot blast, chipped and cleaned.  Internal surfaces 
of frame/frame extensions and distance pieces are painted with an 
oil-proof white primer.  All external surfaces are painted with a red 
oxide primer.   
 
   11.0 Preservation for Shipment - Lubricated Cylinder Applications - For domestic (North 
America) applications, all internal components within the cylinder 
and frame are coated with a rust preventative light oil.  For 
overseas shipment or extended storage (6+ months), the compressor frame and cylinder internals are coated with a heavy 
oil.  Critical components within t he cylinder such as pistons, piston 
rods and valves are removed and boxed separately for better preservation.  It is recommended that most of the heavy oil 
preservative be removed prior to start-up.  Special Note:   If the 
compressor is a domestic shipment, but the package is export, and the packager will be run testing the package in house, it is 
then up to the packager to insure overseas preservation measures 
are taken on the compressor prior to overseas shipment. 
 
     Non-Lube Cylinder Applications - For domestic (North America) 
applications, aluminum paint is used in the cylinder gas passageway and heads as a corrosi on preventative.  On export 
shipments or extended storage, the gas passages and heads will 
be sprayed with a mineral rust preventative after the aluminum 
paint is applied.   Pressure, partition packing and oil wiper rings 
are removed and placed into a greaseproof, waterproof, flexible barrier material followed by an outerwrap.  Export or extended 
storage also require the piston and rod assembly to be removed 
for shipment.  Piston and rider rings are to be removed and packed like the packing rings mentioned earlier.  Piston and rod 
are sprayed with a fingerprint neut ralizer, then the piston, rod and 
jamnut are spayed with a rust pr eventative and finally wrapped like 
the packing rings mentioned above.

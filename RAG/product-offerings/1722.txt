Grid resilience along the entire 
energy value chain
Power transformer case
The problem: ageing assets in a 
strained grid infrastructure
More than half the power transformer outings are due to electrical disturbances, 
natural disasters (e. g. lightning), insulation failures, and other forced impacts.

Power outages in the U.S.
As a result, power outages in the U.S. are 
becoming increasingly more frequent and it  
is feared that their number will continuously 
increase as equipment ages.Most power transformers fail in operation, but 
natural disasters and other forced outages do 
occur and harm the equipment.Causes of transformer failures

Operational issues Natural disasters Other forced outages
A large portion of the installed power trans-
formers within the U.S. were installed in the 
1950s, 60s and 70s and are now reaching the  
end of their projected service life.

Pretact® – Siemens Energy  
grid resilience concept
Most of the aged transformers will need to be replaced by standard power transformers. 
However, there is a strategy beyond replacement. Siemens Energy Transformers‘ cutting  
edge concept gives operators peace of mind.

Siemens Energy is a trade mark licensed by Siemens AG.
Blackout prevention
Dynamic voltage and frequency support 
combined in one unit for optimal power quality. 
Cost-effective solution
Low lifetime expenditures through compact, 
space-saving installation with high power density, 
low losses, and easy maintenance.
Short response time
Fast response time with high active power 
output over several seconds.
High flexibility
The highly adaptable solution is suitable 
for various applications through the flexible 
adjustment of control parameters. Independent of power generation
Not defined as a power generating unit 
and therefore available to all transmission 
system operators who aren‘t allowed to 
operate power generating assets.
Environmentally friendly
Small footprint, no local CO2 emmissions; 
allows more grid access for renewable power 
generators.
Proven technologies
High-end field-proven SVC PLUS® technology 
and innovative application of supercapacitors 
combined into a reliable solution. Operational benefitsThe challenge
While grids are undergoing fundamental changes in terms of power generation, renewable 
infeed and ever-growing demand, power quality and dynamic grid stability are at risk due 
to less synchronous power generation.
SVC PLUS FS: A convincing solution
By using a bulk number of supercapacitors, the new SVC PLUS® frequency stabilizer 
(SVC PLUS FS) is a cost-efficient, compact solution that helps to overcome generation-
consumption imbalances
•b y boosting high active power into the grid when needed emulating system inertia (discharging)
•actively load capacitors when it is benifitial for the grid (charging) as well
•voltage support by means of reactive power compensation like SVC PLUS®siemens-energy.com/SVCPLUSFSSVC PLUS FS

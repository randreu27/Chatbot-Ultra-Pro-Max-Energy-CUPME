Press release by Vattenfall Wärme Berlin AG and Siemens Energy  
Vattenfall and Siemens Energy help advance 
a climate -friendly heating supply for Berlin 
with large -scale heat pump  
• Joint trial of a large -scale, high -temperature heat pump in district heating network  
• Waste heat and renewable electricity utilized to achieve heating transition in Berlin   
• Federal government -funded project links heat, cooling, and electricity  
 
Vattenfall Wärme  Berlin AG and Siemens Energy signed an agreement today to demonstrate and 
trial a new large -scale, high -temperature heat pump in Berlin.  In the Qwark³ project (the German 
acronym represents “coupling of district heating, power, and cooling”), they will te st the use of this 
new technology for the first time at Berlin’s Potsdamer Platz to generate green district heating using 
waste heat and electricity from renewables , and feed it into Berlin’s district  heating network.  The 
project is funded  by the German Minis try of Economic Affairs and Energy as part of its 7th Energy 
Research Program : The aim of the pilot project is to establish robust claims regarding the technical 
and economic potential of generating heat using large -scale and high -temperature heat pumps.  
 
Since 1997, the cooling plant on Berlin’s Potsdamer Platz has been reliably supplying locally and 
efficiently generated cooling power to some 12,000 offices, 1,000 housing units, and numerous 
cultural facilities in the vicinity.  This has previously generat ed unused waste heat, which has been 
dissipated into the surrounding air via cooling towers.  Putting a new high -temperature heat pump 
into operation, however, will provide a more environmentally friendly way of linking heating, 
cooling, and electricity in the future.  The new technology turns waste heat into a usable product, 
improving the energy -efficiency of the cooling power generation process while providing the urban 
district in Berlin with green heat from renewable electricity . The use of the heat pump  will Joint Press Release

substantially reduce the amount of heat being dissipated into the environment and provide 
additional heat for the district heating network, amounting to about 55 GWh per year, with an 
estimated annual saving of about 6,500 metric tons of CO 2 emission s and 120,000 m³ of cooling 
water.   
  
Siemens Energy is delivering this new type of large -scale, high -temperature heat pump to provide 
thermal capacity of up to 8 MW, which will be capable of flexibly delivering flow temperatures in 
the district heating network of between 85°C and about 120°C, depending on ambient conditions.  
This is one way in which technology can make a further contribution toward replacing fossil -based 
heating in urban district heating networks.  In addition to more efficiently linking energy resources 
at a local level, this project represents the first trial of the large -scale, high -temperature heat pump 
at a practical scale under real conditions.  
 
“If we want to achieve the transition to a new energy mix in the cities and rely more on the potential 
of renewables, we need to take an integrated view of heating, cooling, and the electricity supply,” 
comments Tanja Wielgoss, CEO of Vattenfall Wärme Berlin AG.  “That’s the only way we can make 
the best possible use of the available re sources.  We’re proud that we can join forces with Siemens 
Energy to take our cooling plant, which has provided efficient cooling in the Potsdamer Platz 
neighborhood for more than 20 years, and make our system even better with this new large -scale, 
high -temperature heat pump.”  
 
“Decarbonizing our heating supply is a key precondition for successfully achieving the objectives of 
the Paris Accords,” says Jochen Eickholt, Member of the Executive Board of Siemens Energy.  “Large -
scale heat pumps can play an import ant part in the medium to long -term conversion of our heating 
supply system.  We’re very pleased to be working with Vattenfall to advance the heating transition in 
Berlin and trial this potentially key technology for the first time.”

As a traditional Berlin company, Vattenfall Wärme  Berlin AG  has been supplying the capital with energy for over one 
hundred years. Today, 1.3 million residential units in Berlin benefit from locally generated, reliable and environmentally 
friendly district heating as well as district cooling. Vattenfall Wärme reli es on a smartly controlled district heating system, 
holistically conceived energy concepts and decentralised solutions. The aim for the capital is to become climate -neutral by 
2050. Vattenfall supports the state of Berlin in achieving this goal. In a joint  climate protection agreement, the company 
has committed to halving its CO2 emissions by 2020. This goal was already achieved ahead of schedule in 2017. Now, 
together with the state of Berlin, they are working on the coal phase -out by 2030. In parallel, Va ttenfall is working on 
numerous innovative solutions for its great mission: a life without fossil fuels within one generation.

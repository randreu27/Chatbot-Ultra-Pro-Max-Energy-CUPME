Siemens Energy Investor Relations
Dear shareholders,
Three years ago, weembarked onamission toturn Siemens
Energy into aleader oftheenergy transition .During oursecond
quarter, wemade significant progress inourendeavor .Weattained
ownership ofclose to98%ofSiemens Gamesa and delisted the
shares from theSpanish stock exchange inFebruary .Furthermore,
wesuccessfully issued new equity and agreen bond torefinance
theSiemens Gamesa transaction .
The former Gas and Power businesses, Gas Services (GS), Grid
Technologies (GT) andTransformation ofIndustry (TI)enjoy strong
order andrevenue growth andmargin expansion .Siemens Gamesa
remains adrag onourperformance, however, some ofthelead
indicators suggest ourrestructuring efforts arestarting tobear fruit.
OnMay 15,ourCEO, Christian Bruch, andourCFO, Maria Ferraro,
presented ourQ2andfiscal year 2023 results .
“Strong orders confirm ourvery good positioning inthemarkets for
energy transition technologies, such aspower generation and
transmission .Our adjusted outlook reflects the strong demand, as
well asthecontinuous challenging market environment inthewind
industry .The turnaround ofthe wind business remains the
cornerstone ofbecoming aprofitable leader ofthe energy
transition”, said Christian Bruch .
Siemens Energy’s markets remained favorable .Consequently ,SE
order growth continued tobevery strong showing comparable
growth of56.3%.New orders of€12.3bnpushed theorder book to
arecord value of€102bn,thefirst time above €100bn.Revenue
amounted to€8.0bnand increased by23.8%onacomparable
basis .Allsegments contributed tothisgrowth .
Siemens Energy's profit before special items was positive with
€41m.Aloss atSiemens Gamesa was more than offset byastrong
performance inallother segments, ledbyGas Services .
Siemens Energy reported aNet loss of€189mand basic
earnings pershare (EPS) were negative €0.25.Free cash flow pre
taxwas negative at€294m.Higher cash outflow atSiemens
Gamesa was partly offset bystrong cash flow inother segments,
primarily atGrid Technologies .Due tothe financial performance inthe first half-year and
business volume growing faster than previously planned, we
adjusted theoutlook forfiscal 2023 :Management now expects
comparable revenue growth oftheSiemens Energy Group between
10%and 12%(previously between 3%and 7%).Profit margin
before Special items ofSiemens Energy isnow expected around
thelowend oftheguidance range of1%to3%due toSiemens
Gamesa’s poor performance inthefirsthalf-year.Accordingly, Net
loss ofSiemens Energy Group isexpected toexceed prior fiscal
year’s level byuptoalow-triple -digit million €amount .
Following two tender periods Siemens Gamesa delisted on
February 14andtheshares nolonger trade .Siemens Gamesa has
called anextraordinary shareholder meeting (EGM) onJune 12and
13.For the remaining Siemens Gamesa shareholders, to
receive acompensation of€18.05per share, asufficient
number ofshareholders willhave toparticipate inthis EGM and
vote infavor ofaselective capital reduction (see page 3).
Thank you foryour interest inSiemens Energy .Iwish you good
health andallthebest.

nolonger fungible andmany retail brokers nolonger attribute avalue totheshares .Siemens Energy
now owns close to98%ofSiemens Gamesa shares and iswilling tobuytheremaining shares for
€18.05pershare (inlinewith theprevious tender offer) .This willonly bepossible ifasufficient

Siemens Energy Shareholder Letter Q2 FY2023 4attention astheexpansion ofrenewable energies," says TimHolt, member oftheManaging Board ofSiemens
Energy ."Italy hasexcellent conditions forrenewable power generation .The project willensure thattheregions
involved canalso derive thebest possible economic benefits from thisandhelp Italy achieve amore sustainable
andsecure power supply .“
Tyrrhenian Link isSiemens Energy's firstHVDC project inItaly.Theenergy technology company willbuild four
converter stations attherespective end points ofthetwosections ofthelink:The East Section ofthelink
connects Campania ontheItalian mainland withSicily, while theWest Section connects Sicily withSardinia .The
stations convert alternating current fedfrom therespective local gridintodirect current fortransport viaundersea
cables .Thestation attheother endofthelineconverts theelectricity back intoalternating current sothatitcanbe
fedback intotheregional grid.Ramping up renewable energy: Siemens Energy connects Italy's 
largest islands to the mainland
Tremendous Thor: RWE selects Siemens Gamesa as preferred 
supplier for 1,000 -MW offshore wind power plant in Denmark
RWE isfurther progressing withthedeployment ofDenmark’s
largest offshore wind power plant todate bysigning a
Preferred Supplier Agreement withSiemens Gamesa .72units
ofSiemens Gamesa’s flagship SG14-236DDoffshore wind
turbines areplanned tobeinstalled atRWE’s 1,000-MW Thor
project .Inaddition, aservice contract forthewind turbines is
included .Alldeliveries aresubject toRWE’s final investment
decision .Once fully operational, which isplanned tobeno
later than theendof2027 ,RWE’s Thor offshore wind power
plant would becapable ofproducing enough green electricity
tosupply theequivalent ofmore than one million Danish
households .
For Italy tobenefit from renewable energy the flexible
exchange ofelectricity between theislands ofSardinia, Sicily
and theItalian mainland iskey.Hence, Italian transmission
system operator Terna isbuilding the"Tyrrhenian Link" and
awarded acontract tosupply four converter stations forthe
project toaconsortium ofSiemens Energy andItaly's FATA
(part ofDanieli group) .Siemens Energy willprovide key
technology tothe high-voltage direct current (HVDC)
transmission link, which willcover 970km.Theorder volume
forSiemens Energy amounts tojustunder onebillion euro.
"The expansion ofpower grids must receive thesame
RWE willbuild theThor wind power plant intheDanish North Sea, approximately 22kilometers from Thorsminde
onthewest coast ofJutland .Installation oftheturbines atseaisexpected tobegin in2026 .Theinstallation works
areplanned tobecarried outfrom thePort ofEsbjerg, Denmark .Both RWE andSiemens Gamesa intend to
utilize theskilled local workforce during theconstruction andcommissioning oftheproject, both intheharbor as
wellasoffshore .
TheSG14-236DDisSiemens Gamesa’s flagship offshore wind turbine .Itfeatures acapacity ofalmost 15MW
anda236-meter diameter rotor with anastounding swept area of43,500square meters .This allows theSG14-
236 DDtoprovide anincrease ofmore than 30%inAnnual Energy Production (AEP) compared toits
predecessor .
Outlook for the fiscal year 2023
Due tothefinancial performance inthefirsthalf-year
and business volume growing faster than previously
planned, weamended theoutlook forthefiscal year
2023 forSiemens Energy .Thenew forecast isbased
on higher revenue growth assumptions for all
segments .
Profit assumptions fortheGS,GTandTIsegments
remain unchanged .Inthefirsthalfofthefiscal year,
GTwaswellinitsanticipated range which isexpected
tocontinue while GS and TIoutperformed partly
benefiting from positive nonrecurring effects .
For Siemens Gamesa the situation remains
volatile, however, weexpect animprovement inthe
second half ofthefiscal year, butnotcompensating
theweak firsthalf.
Therefore, we now expect Siemens Energy to
achieve acomparable revenue growth (excluding
currency translation andportfolio effects) inarange of
10%to12%(previously between 3%and7%).Profit margin before Special items isnow expected
around thelowendoftheguidance range of1%to
3%duetoSiemens Gamesa's poor performance inthe
firsthalf-year.
Accordingly, Netloss ofSiemens Energy Group is
expected toexceed prior fiscal year’s level of
€712mbyuptoalow-triple -digit million €amount
(previously tobeonprior fiscal year’s reported level) .
We confirm previous quarter’s guidance ofa
positive Free cash flow pretaxuptoalowtriple -digit
million €amount forfiscal year 2023 .
The outlook forSiemens Energy assumes nomajor
negative financial impacts from COVID -19orother
pandemic related events, nofurther deterioration inthe
supply chain and rawmaterial cost environment, and
excludes charges related tolegal and regulatory
matters .

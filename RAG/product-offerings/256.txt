To be able to meet the demand for green hydrogen, large capacities of high-performance electrolyzers are needed. Together with its partner Air Liquide, Siemens Energy opened a new electrolyzer production facility in Berlin on November 8, 2023. By 2025, at least three gigawatts of electrolysis capacity per year are to be brought to market from there. Further information on the topic as well as photo and video material can be found here.

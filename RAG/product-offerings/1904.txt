Emissions under 
control with the 
software solution 
EMIDATE
Smart and systematic recording  
and evaluation of emission data.
This allows the monitoring of pollutants  
to permissible limits. The results are  
graphically visualized and stored.
Officially examined and certified
Based on Austrian laws and regulations as well as  
standards EMIDATE was developed in the 1980’s  
with a goal to control emissions precisely. 
The current version was
• Type approved by TÜV Austria according  
to ÖNORM M9412,
• MCERT certified by CSA Group,
• Certified according to EN14181 by Synlab.
Emidate is compliant with
• LCPD (Large combustion plant directive)
• WID (Waste incineration directive)Modular system
The system is modular, relies on proven standard components 
and can be upgraded smoothly. Therefore, it can be easily 
adapted to fulfill non-standard requirements of customers and 
authorities. 
The data acquisition is primarily achieved via the indus -
try-standard Ethernet. As peripheral components SIMATIC 
devices of all generations with ethernet interfaces can be 
used. Using a SIMATIC CPU as gateway enables EMIDATE the 
use of all systems that are compatible with a SIMATIC CPU, 
thus, enabling the use of protocols, such as:
• Profibus
• Profinet
• S7-Connection
• Modbus TCP
We offer complete 
systems:

in power plants, waste incineration plants and  
district heating plants as well as in other industrial plants.
Highlights of EMIDATE
• Online parameterization
• Easy manageable and expandable multilingual  
user interface
• Freely adjustable actual-value and compression cycles
• Easy access to stored data (graphs and tables)
• Automatic export of data to Intra- and Internet
• Acknowledgment for messages including  
acoustic alerting
• Entering comments by the plant operator – triggered 
spontaneously or by a particular event (with optional 
approval process)
One license – many possibilities
The well-structured license model enables a cost-effective 
use of EMIDATE from small to huge plants. Based on  
the server/client architecture each EMIDATE server can  
also act as a client for other servers in the network.  
Emission data (online-values and stored values) can be 
visualized on different clients – even in the office network.Reporting
Reports, which are amongst others used to proof of fulfill -
ment of authority regulations, can be generated periodi -
cally or on demand. The generated protocols can either  
be printed or saved as a PDF-file. These PDF-files can be  
sent via email or transferred to a FTP-server. In addition  
to the requirements defined in ÖNORM amongst others an 
Excel protocol is available, where all data stored in EMIDATE 
can be processed and presented with all available Excel 
functions. All IED reports are available as templates. 
A scheduled export of data in a machine-readable format 
for distribution to a network via FTP is available. Thus, 
various data exports to control systems or authorities  
can be realized.
Applied in various branches
EMIDATE is mainly used in power plants, waste incineration 
plants and district heating plants, but also in other 
branches such as the chemical, cement and paper industry. 
The system can also be used as a data acquisition system 
for non-emission relevant applications.4 xI

Siemens Energy AG announces preliminary Q1 results. Strong underlying performance
notwithstanding charges at Siemens Gamesa. Siemens Energy outlook adjusted for ﬁscal year 2023.
-------------------------------------------
Siemens Energy today announces preliminary ﬁrst quarter results of ﬁscal year 2023.
 
Order intake: €12.727m (consensus €9.453m)
Revenue: €7.064m (consensus: €6.644m)
Proﬁt: neg. €384m (consensus: neg. €32m), reﬂecting a margin of neg. 5.4% (consensus: neg. 0.5%)
Proﬁt before Special Items: neg. €282m (consensus: €53m), reﬂecting a margin of neg. 4.0%
(consensus: 0.8%)
Free cash ﬂow pre tax: neg. €58m
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal year 2023 Siemens Energy delivered strong order and revenue growth
and better than expected cash ﬂow. However, a strong underlying operational proﬁt improvement at
Gas Services, Grid Technologies, and Transformation of Industry was more than offset by charges at
Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. These charges were triggered by an evaluation of the failure
rate of the installed ﬂeet, during which Siemens Gamesa detected a negative development of failure
rates in speciﬁc components resulting in higher warranty and service maintenance costs than
previously estimated.
Fiscal year 2023 assumptions for Gas Services, Grid Technologies and Transformation of Industry in
respect to revenue growth and proﬁt margins before special items remain unchanged.
Gas Services: comparable revenue growth of 0% to 4%; proﬁt margin before special items of 9% to
11%
Grid Technologies: comparable revenue growth of 5% to 9%; proﬁt margin before special items of 6%
to 8%
Transformation of Industry: comparable revenue growth of 5% to 9%; proﬁt margin before special
items of 3% to 5%
Siemens Energy management continues to expect for Siemens Energy comparable revenue growth
(excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) in ﬁscal year 2023 in a range of 3% to 7%
(unchanged).
Siemens Gamesa management no longer expects Siemens Gamesa’s proﬁtability to be in line with its
business plan for ﬁscal year 2023, due to the charges mentioned above. Therefore, Siemens Energy
management now expects Siemens Energy’s proﬁt margin before special items in a range of 1% to 3%
(before 2% to 4%).
Because of the reasons mentioned above Siemens Energy management expects a Net loss on prior
year’s reported level (compared to a sharp reduction before).
Siemens Energy management now expects free cash ﬂow pre tax to be positive. This compares with a
previous expectation of free cash ﬂow pre tax to be in a negative range of low- to mid-triple-digit
million.
The outlook for Siemens Energy assumes no major negative ﬁnancial impacts from COVID-19 or other
pandemic related events, no further deterioration in the supply chain and raw material cost
environment, and excludes charges related to legal and regulatory matters.

W1C Single  Phase Thyristor  - HV Power Supply for 
Electrostatic Precipitator ESP  

 
     sheet 2 of 7 SIPREC T Technical Description  
SIPREC T consists of the HV control cubicle with integrated SIPREC thyristor controller and the SIPREC 
TR50  / TR60 HV transformer rectifier set.  
    
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The standard SIPREC control cubicle ( W x D x H: 600 / 800 mm x 5 00mm x 2000mm) mainly consists of 
the fused disconnector, current transformer, SCR thyristor stack and SIPREC controller components. 
Within the vessel of the HV transformer rectifier set the CLR, HV transformer, HV rectifier, HV choke 
and HV divider are integrated. Additional components can be added according to the requirements.  
 
SIPREC T Technology Concept  
 

 
     sheet 3 of 7 The mains power supply (2AC 400V …. 690V, 50Hz / 60Hz) is connected to a fuse switch -disconnector. 
With the SCR t hyristor stack ( W1C / two antiparallel thyristors)  the low voltage supplied to the HV-
transformer is stepless controlled  by the SIPREC controller . The high voltage generated by the HV -
transformer  is rectified by the bridge rectifier  providing the ESP voltage with a 100Hz ripple (at  50Hz 
mains frequency) . The achievable maximum voltage / current values depend on the ESP breakdown 
voltage and load conditions.

     sheet 4 of 7 SIPREC T Functions 
The operating mode of the electrostatic 
precipitator ESP (wet / dry) is governed by the 
raw gas  / particulate (aerosol) conditions. As 
electrostatic precipitators are used in virtually all 
process industries, conditions specific to the 
plant process like s tartup  / shutdown operation, 
load cycling and varying gas conditions  due to 
changed fuels / raw materials  etc. must be 
considered in addition . 
Maximum particulate (aerosol)  collection 
efficiency under greatly differing operating conditions requires process -specific control of 
precipitator voltage  / current by the automatic 
precipitator control system. The SIPREC controller is equipped with automatic optimizing functions which ensure maximum 
collection efficiencies under any load condition. 
In addition, parameter sets tailored to the 
specific process conditions can be activated.  
Full exploitation of the optimization potential 
requires that all the SIPREC controls of an 
electrostatic precipitator are interlinked with each other (PROFIBUS). The necessary optimization and coordination functions are performed by the SIPREC ODS visualization, 
diagnostic and optimization expert software installed at a PC equipped with a PROFIBUS interface. Typical examples are energy 
optimization to reduce operating costs, 
coordination of rapping cycles, coordination and optimization fo r intermittent operation 
(back corona conditions) and diagnostic 
functions.  
 
Flashover Detection  
The precipitator voltage is controlled at an 
optimum level just under the flashover limit. 
When the flashover limit is reached, a flashover 
occurs. The SIPREC T controller detects each flashover and initiates appropriate corrective action.  
Partial discharges typical for wet ESP's are 
difficult to detect by common detection 
methods. None detected discharges, however, 
lead in possible damages to the ESP internals , 
ESP casing or insulators. SIPREC T provides in addition to the common flashover  / spark 
detection a special detection for partial  
discharges to prevent the formation of arcs and to protect the wet ESP.
 
 
Flashover Processing  
After detection of a flashover, the SIPREC controller first identifies the type of flashover 
based on  its time of occurrence and the 
precipitator voltage and current profiles. For this 
purpose, the following types of flashover are distinguished:  
 
• self-quenching flashover (spark) in dry- type 
electrostatic precipitators  
• non-self- quenching flashover   
• follow -up flashover  
• wet ESP partial discharges  
 
 
SIPREC oscilloscope: signals for secondary 
voltage / secondary current / rectified primary 
current at flashover processing  
SIPREC automatically optimizes the flashover 
reactions as a function of the intensity and type of the preceding flashovers. For precipitator 
operation just below the ESP breakdown 

 
     sheet 5 of 7 voltage, this ensures a fast  as possible  flashover 
response (rapid recharging of the electrostatic 
precipitator) to achieve maximum / maximized 
corona power.  
 
Voltage Control in the Area of 
the Flashover Limit  
For optimum ESP  performance, the maximum 
possible ESP voltage  / time area and thus the 
maximum ESP corona power must always be 
attained (the exception is operation with back 
corona or  energy minimization ) .  
The flashover limit varies  depending on actual 
operating conditions (dust concentration / 
composition, gas humid ity, gas temperature 
etc.). Therefore, the ESP voltage / current must 
be constantly adapted  as quick as possible but 
without unnecessary number of provoked 
flashovers.   
For this purpose, the SIPREC T controller 
optimizes the ESP voltage adaption to the 
changing flashover level based on  Fuzzy Logic 
optimized set- points.  
 
Pulse Operation  
In pulse operation (intermittent operation), the line voltage half -waves are individually 
controlled  as compared with full -wave 
operation  (continuously powered ).  
Pulse operation provides an effective method of 
overcoming back corona and achieves higher 
dust collection efficiencies under such 
conditions than full -wave operation.  
  
SIPREC oscilloscope: Signals for secondary 
voltage / secondary current / rectified primary 
current at pulse operation  
Optimum adjustment of the pulse parameters is 
essential for good precipitator performance in 
the pulsing mode. The operating results 
achieved do not only depend on the 
characteristics of the dust to be collected , 
process parameters like raw gas dust content, flow rate and temperature but also on the location of the electric field in gas flow direction 
and the thickness of the dust layer on the 
collecting electrodes.  
 
Optimum Operating Point with  
Fuzzy Logic  
The ESP voltage V prec must be adapted 
continuously to the flashover limit V FO.  
VFO varies depending on actual operating 
conditions (dust concentration  / composition, 
gas humidity, gas temperature etc.).  
Fuzzy Logic adapts the behavior of the power 
supply  to the best possible operating point and 
the fast power electronics carr ies out the 
commands of the overlaid control even faster than the reaction time of the precipitator.  
 
 
 
 

 
     sheet 6 of 7 Collecting Electrode Rapping  
Besides voltage supply, the effectiveness of 
collecting electrode rapping is of key 
importance to achieve best possible dry ESP 
collection efficiency.  
To ensure effective collecting electrode rapping, 
the rapping intervals must be individually 
optimized f or each electric field to suit the 
respective operating conditions.  
In applications involving highly resistive dust or 
dust with a pronounced sticking behavior, the 
precipitator voltage may have to be reduced or 
even cyclically blocked during electrode rapping.  
The c ollecting electrode rapping can  be 
controlled by SIPREC I  or the rapping signal of 
the external control (PLC / DCS) can be connected to SIPREC I.  
The SIPREC I controller provide 10 selectable 
rapping parameter sets which are adjusted and 
activated in accordance with the respective 
process conditions  (e.g. rapping mode , interval 
settings , rapping current decrease, power -off 
cycle).   
The c oordination of the rapping intervals in the 
individual electric fields is accomplished with 
the aid of the S IPREC ODS system.  
  
 
Addon: SIPREC ODS  
The SIPREC ODS program based on WINDOWS 
operating system supports the S IPREC HV  power 
supply systems for the central operation, visualization, data archiving of measured 
operating values, for optimization of the ESP 
operation  and diagnostic purposes.  
SIPREC ODS optimize the ESP collecting 
efficiency at lowest power consumption. The extensive diagnostic functions enable beside 
the fault analysis the evaluation of the ESP operating process and provide information for 
the predictive maintenance. Furthermore, the  
diagnostic functions also form the basis for the 
fast and inexpensive Siemens Energy remote service.

 
 Earnings Release  Q2 FY 202 3 
January  1 to March  31, 2023 
Munich, Germany , May 15,  2023 – Siemens Energy  today announced  its results for the second  quarter of fiscal year 202 3 that ended March  31, 202 3. 
Strong  order s, substantially higher revenue, positive P rofit before Special items held 
back by  Siemens Gamesa  
“Strong orders confirm our very good positioning in the markets for energy transition technologies, such as  power generation and transmission. Our adjusted  
outlook reflects the  strong demand , as well as the continuous challenging market environment in the wind industry. The turnaround of the wind business 
remains the cornerstone of becoming a profitable leader of the energy transition ”, says Christian Bruch, Pre sident and CEO of Siemens Energy AG.  
• Siemens Energy’s market s remain ed favo rable . Consequently,  the Company  continu ed to enjoy  strong growth in orders and in revenue. Profit  continued to 
be impacted by supply chain challenges,  the ramp -up of the offshore activities as well as by effects from onerous projects  at Siemens Gamesa . 
• Siemens Energy recorded orders of €12.3bn reflecting 56.3% growth on a comparable basis (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects). The Book -
to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) came in at  1.53 and the order backlog reached a new record of €102 .0bn exceeding the €100bn mark , for the first 
time . 
• Revenue increase d by 23.8% on a comparable basis to €8.0bn reflecting  growth in all segments.  
• Siemens Energy’s Profit before Special items was  positive with  €41m (Q 2 FY 2022: negative € 49m). A loss at Siemens Gamesa was more than offset by a 
strong performance in all other segments, led by Gas Services (GS) . Positive  Special items of €23m (Q2 FY 2022: negative €54m) were drive n by  a positive 
effect of €78m in connection with the “Accelerating Impact” program reported under restructuring costs. Most measures of the program have been executed 
or contractually solved.  Due to improved market conditions and volume growth,  the assessment of the further progress of the program  has changed. The 
positive effect  more than offset  an increase  in other restructuring and integration costs. Therefore, Profit for Siemens Energy was positive with €64m 
(Q2 FY 2022: negative € 103m). 
• Siemens Energy reported a Net loss of €189m (Q 2 FY 2022: Net loss €2 56m). Corresponding basic earnings per share (EPS) were negative  €0.25 (Q2 FY 2022: 
negative € 0.22). 
• As expected, Free cash flow pre tax was negative with € 294m (Q 2 FY 2022: negative € 351m). A higher  cash outflow at Siemens Gamesa w as partly offset by 
strong cash flow in other segments, primarily at Grid Technologies (GT) . 
• Due to the financial performance in the first half -year and business volume growing faster than previously planned , Siemens Energy  adjusted its outlook for 
fiscal year 2023. Management now expects a comparable revenue growth of the Siemens Energy Group between 10% and 12% (previously  between 3% and 
7%). Profit margin before Special items of Siemen s Energy is now expected around  the low end of  the guidance range of 1% to 3%  due to Siemens Gamesa's 
poor performance in the first half -year . Accordingly , Net loss of Siemens Energy Group is expected to exceed prior fiscal year’s level by up to a low-triple -
digit million € amount .

 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements includes items which 
management does not consider to be indicative of the segments’ perfor -
mance – mainly group management costs (management and corporate func-
tions) and other central items, Treasury activities as well as eliminations. 
Other central items include Siemens brand  fees, corporate services  (e.g. man-
agement of the Group’s real estate portfolio (except Siemens Gamesa ), which 
was allocated to the Gas and Power segment  in the prior year) , corporate 
projects, centrally held equity interests and other items.  
The negative change year -over -year in Reconciliation to Consolidated Finan-
cial Statements was mainly due to increased costs for corporate functions  and 
other central items .

6 Outlook  
Due to the financial performance in the first half -year  and business volume growing faster than previously planned , we amended the outlook for the fiscal year 
2023 for Siemens Energy. The new forecast  is based on higher revenue growth assumptions for all segments. Profit assumptions  for the GS, GT and TI segments 
remain unchanged . In the first half of the fiscal year, GT w as well in its anticipated range which is expected to continue  while  GS and TI outpe rform ed partly 
benefiting from  positive nonrecurring  effects . For Siemens Gamesa the situation remains volatile. However, we expect an improvement in the second half of 
the fiscal year but not compensating the weak first half.  Siemens Gamesa  continue s to focus on managing  operational problems and the turnaround, primarily 
through the rigorous execution of the “Mistral” program.  The performance of Siemens Gamesa throughout the fiscal year 2023 will also depend on the timely 
ramp -up of the offshore activ ities.  
Therefore, we now expect Siemens Energy to achieve a comparable revenue growth (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) in a range of 10% to 
12% (previously between 3% and 7%) . Profit margin before S pecial items is now expected around  the low end of the guidance range of 1% to 3% due to Siemens  
Gamesa's  poor  performance  in the first half-year.  Accordingly, Net loss of Siemens Energy Group is expected to exceed prior fiscal year’s level of €712 m by up 
to a low-triple -digit million  € amount  (previously to be on prior fiscal year’s reported level) . We confirm previous quarter’s guidance of a positive Free cash 
flow pre tax up to a  low triple -digit million € amount  for fiscal year 2023 . 
The outlook for Siemens Energy assumes no major negative financial impacts from COVID -19 or other pandemic related events, no further deterioration in the  
supply chain and raw material cost environment, and excludes charges related to legal and regulatory matters.  The outlook is based on the following overall 
assumptions for the segments:  
• GS now plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of 10% to 12% (previously between 0% and 4%). The targeted Profit margin before Special items 
remains between 9% and 11% (uncha nged).  
• GT now plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of 12% to 14% (previously between 5% and 9%). The targeted Profit margin before Special items 
remains between 6% and 8% (unchanged).  
• TI now  plans  to achieve  a comparable  revenue  growth  of 8% to 10% (previously  between  5% and 9%).  The targeted  Profit  margin  before  Special  items  re-
mains  between  3% and 5% (unchanged).  
• Siemens  Gamesa  plans  to achieve  a comparable  revenue  growth  of 6% to 10%  for the fiscal  year  2023  and to reach  a Profit  margin  before  Special  items  
towards  negative  11% .

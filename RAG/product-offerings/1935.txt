Information to the ‘Siemens Energy  Code of Conduct for Siemens Energy 
suppliers’, section ‘management system for environmental protection’  
This information shall help the suppliers to understand the expected requirements of the ‘reasonable 
Management systems for environmental protection’. The supplier’s relevance and responsibility in 
terms of environmental protection depends essentially on the type of activities (e.g. production, 
services, project work) and the resources being used.  
A disti nction is therefore made between suppliers that perform solely administrative/ management or 
advisory functions, e.g. sales -, IT- and marketing related activities (category 1), and those that have 
a higher environmental impact (category 2 or 3).

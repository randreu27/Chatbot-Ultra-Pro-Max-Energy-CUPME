 
1 Earnings Release  Q1 FY 2022   
October  1 to December  31, 2021  
Munich, Germany, February 9, 2022  – Siemens Energy today announced its results for the first quarter of 
fiscal year 2022 that ended December  31, 2021.  
Solid performance at Gas and Power overshadowed by 
negative development at SGRE  
„The solid performance of Gas and Power shows  that we make progress with our transformation.  Our 
measures have started to have an impact, and the results are heading in the right direction. However, the 
latest profit warning at Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy is a setback and disappointing for all  
shareholders. As majority shareholder, we will continue to support SGRE in achieving the turnaround in the 
onshore business even in a difficult market environment ”, says Christian Bruch, President and CEO of  
Siemens Energy AG.  
• Continuing constraints in global s upply chain s cause challenges in the busine ss. While operational per-
formance at Gas and Power ( GP) was solid , Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy ( SGRE ) was impacted 
harder than expected by difficult  supply markets and faced project -related and technical challenges.  
• Both segments contributed to another  strong quarter for order intake at  €8.3bn, up 10.1% on a compa-
rable basis  (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects ). Strong Book -to-bill ratio (ratio of orders 
to revenue) of 1.40 resulted in  a new record order backlog of €87.1bn . 
• Revenue was €6.0bn,  11.4% lower on a comparable basis , in line with our expectations, due to timing 
effects associated with the execution of large projects in both segments and supply chain constraints  
impacting revenue conversion mainly at SGRE . 
• While GP subs tantially improved its Adjusted EBITA,  SGRE  reported a negative result of €31 8m, impacted 
by additional supply chain related costs and ramp -up challenges with the 5.X platform of  the onshore 
business . 
• Adjusted EBITA for Siemens Energy was negative € 57m (Q 1 FY 2021: positive € 243m) due to  the negative 
result  at SGRE . Recent quarter saw minor impact s from  special items of positive €6m (Q 1 FY 2021: nega-
tive €123m). Adjusted EBITA before special items of Siemens Energy was negative € 63m compared to 
positive  €366m in prior -year quarter.  
• Net loss amounted to € 240m (Q1 FY 2021:  net income  of €99m). Corresponding basic earnings per share 
(EPS) were negative € 0.18 (Q1 FY 2021: positive  €0.09) . 
• Free cash flow  pre tax sharply improved  year-over-year to negative  €69m (Q1 FY 2021: negative €388m ) 
driven by a very strong performance  of GP. 
• Due to financial performance at SGRE in the recent quarter and its adjusted guidance , Siemens Energy 
amended its outlook f or fiscal year 2022  and will reassess its prior expectations for Si emens Energy 
Group’s Adjusted EBITA margin before special items for fiscal year 2023.  For fiscal year 2022, m anage-
ment now expects Siemens Energy Group ’s comparable revenue development to be in a range of negative 
2% to positive 3% and an Adjusted EBITA margin before special items between positive 2% and positive 
4%.

1 Comparable basis: Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects  • On a comparable basis, o rders clearly increased  supported by higher 
volume from  large orders in both segments compared to prior -year 
quarter.  
• Book -to-bill ratio was strong  at 1.40. Order backlog rose to a new 
high  of €87.1bn (September 30, 2021: €83.8bn) . 
• Significant decline in r evenue was in line with our expectations and 
mainly related to the phasing of large projects in both segments . 
• Service revenue came in slightly above  prior-year quarter ’s level . 
• On a nominal basis , orders rose 12.1% and revenue declined 8.9%.  
• Adjusted EBITA  sharply declined as the negative result  at SGRE out-
weighed a subs tantially higher result at GP  year-over-year. 
• Impacts from s pecial items sharply  decreased in both segments, pri-
marily at GP because of  lower  stand -alone costs and a positive effect 
related to  strategic portfolio decisions.  
• Adjusted EBITA before special it ems and corresponding margin of Sie-
mens Energy also sharply decreased year -over -year due to the nega-
tive result  at SGRE . 
• During the quarter, provisions for pensions and similar obligations 
slightly increased  from  €830m as of September  30, 2021 to € 836m 
as of December  31, 2021 .

1 Comparable basis: Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects  • Significant order growth at GP was supported by increases across all 
businesses. The increase was driven by the new unit business and 
benefited from large orders.  
• From a regional perspective , the reporting regions Americas and 
Asia, Australia  contributed to  order growth.  
• GP reported a high Book -to-bill ratio of 1. 42 resulting in a  record  or-
der backlog at quarter -end of €5 3.6bn. 
• Revenue clearly decreased  mostly related to timing effects associated 
with the execution of large projects  at Generation . 
• Service revenue was largely stable compared to the prior -year quar-
ter. 
• On a nominal basis, orders increased by 14.0%, and revenue went 
down by 3.6%.  
• Adjusted E BITA of GP had a  solid  quarterly performance. S ubstantial  
improve ment  year-over-year mainly  due to lower impacts from spe-
cial items compared to prior -year quarter . 
• In total , slight  effects  from special items due to sharply reduced 
stand -alone costs year -over-year and a positive one -time effect re-
lated to aeroderivative gas turbines previously written -off. 
• Free cash flow pre tax sharply increased year-over -year primarily due 
to project -related advance payments .

 • Orders in the SGRE segment clearly  increased year-over-year. In-
creases in the offshore and service businesses more than offset an 
onshore decline.  
• Book -to-bill ratio of SGRE came in at 1. 35 leading to an order backlog 
of €3 3.6bn at quarter -end,  above prior fiscal year -end’s  level.  
• Revenue was substantially down compared to  prior -year quarter’s 
level  driven by  the decline in the wind turbines business. The service 
business posted an increase . 
• On a nominal basis, segment’s orders i ncreased by 8.4% , and reve-
nue decreased by 20.3%. 
• Adjusted EBITA deteriorated compared to prior -year quarter mainly 
driven by stronger than expected supply chain related disruptions 
and ramp -up challenges of their onshore 5.X platform . These nega-
tive earni ngs effects totaled €289m.  
• Impacts from special items sharply declined year -over -year. 
• Negative Free cash flow pre tax sharply increased  year-over -year, 
amongst other factors , due to  an increase of inventories .

 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements includes items 
which management does not consider to be indicative of the segments ’ 
performance – mainly  centrally carried pension expenses , Treasury ac-
tivities  and other central items as well as eliminations.  Beginning with 
fiscal year 2022, GP segment’s Real Estate Services, formerly shown un-
der Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements, are assigned to 
segment GP. Related prior year information has been reclassified to con-
form to the current -year p resentation.  
The positive change year -over-year in Reconciliation to Consolidated Fi-
nancial Statements was mainly due to elimination effects.

5 Outlook  
Due to the business development of SGRE in the recent quarter and its adjus ted guidance, we amend ed the 
outlook for the fiscal year 202 2 for the SGRE segment and, accordingly, for Siemens Energy.  In addition , 
management will reassess its prior expectations for Siemens Energy Group’s Adjusted EBITA margin before 
special items for fiscal year 2023 of positive 6.5% to positive 8.5%.  
Our assessment for Siemens Energy’s business environment remains widely unchanged and we confirm GP 
segment’s outlook for fiscal year 2022. G lobal economy should  continue to grow in fiscal year 2022 and we 
expect  global supply chain constraints to persist  as well as COVID -19 to remain a factor of uncertainty . There-
fore, a shortage of materials and components and/or a lack of freight capacity may continue to have a n 
impact on our business, especially as it pertains to the on -time execution of large projects. Nevertheless , we 
are still confident that the measures we have taken as part of our transformation – especially at GP – will 
lead to higher profitability at Sie mens Energy in fiscal year 2022 , although on a lower than expected level.  
For Siemens Energy  in fiscal year 2022, we now expect comparable revenue development (excluding cur-
renc y translation and portfolio effects) to be in a range of negative 2% to positive 3% ( previously negative 
1% to positive 3%)  and an Adjusted EBITA margin before special items between  positive  2% and positive 4% 
(previously between positive 3% and positive 5%). We still expect a sharp improvement of Net income and 
Free cash flow pre tax to be in a range of a positive mid -triple -digit million € . 
For the GP segment  in fiscal year 2022, the outlook is unchanged . We target comparable revenue growth 
to be in a ran ge of positive 1% to positive 5% and Adjusted EBITA margin before special items to be between 
positive 4.5% and positive 6.5%.  
For the SGRE segment , we now expect in fiscal year 2022 a comparable decline of revenue between nega-
tive 2% and negative 9% (prev iously negative 2% and negative 7%). Adjusted EBITA margin before special 
items now is expected to be in a range of negative 4% to positive 1% (previously positive 1% to positive 4%).  
This guidance assumes no further major financial impacts from COVID -19 on our business activity and ex-
cludes charges related to legal and regulatory matters.

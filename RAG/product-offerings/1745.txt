The challenges set by decarbonization and decentralization require resilient grids. 
It becomes necessary to flexibly support the grid at different locations in the shortest possible 
amount of time. Stabilizing the grid is especially important in the following applications:
• Change of network condition by decentral power generation
• Line rework and restauration
• High flexible change of network condition
• Restauration after severe incidences (e. g. thunderstorm, fire …)
Solutions
More efficient use of existing transmission infrastructure is the key. SVC PLUS Mobile, the 
Siemens Energy‘s STATCOM, known as SVC PLUS®, on wheels ensures optimum grid stability and 
power quality. It can be used independenly of the grid configuration and belongs to Siemens 
Energy‘s powerful portfolio of flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS).In general: where time for system planning is rare and buffer is needed
The mobile STATCOM
can be moved and re-
installed within a period  
of days in a region to 
support grids locally.
SVC Plus Mobile can allow 
sufficient planning and 
implementation time to 
support grids temporarily 
during rework.
Cost and time efficient:
The solution makes it 
possible to overcome the 
duration of long projects  
as e.g. line rework.
Hightech: Based on 
Siemens Energy‘s inno-
vative voltage-sourced 
converter technology (VSC) 
with very low footprint.Benefits in a nutshellSVC PLUS Mobile
Siemens Energy multi-tool for trans-
mission grids – temporary grid support 
and grid resilience during emergencies

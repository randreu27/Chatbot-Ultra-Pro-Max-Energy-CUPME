B. Product Specification for MOS Frames 
 
1.0 Frame Configuration -  Multi-throw, balance- opposed, rigid cast gray iron frame is heavily 
ribbed for strength and reinforced wi th integrally cast on crosshead 
extensions.  The open frame top construction contains (2) two carbon 
steel stay bars individually fitted per pair of compressor throws.  The two stay bars are located at the ends of the crank throw bay, one 
over each main bearing.  Gasketed covers, on top of each frame bay, 
allow for the easy access to all of the internal frame and running gear components.  The inside of the frame is painted with an oil proof 
white primer paint.  The lower flat bottom part of the frame forms the 
sump for lubricating oil.

Options - Explosion Relief Device (Bicera Relief Valve). 
Frame Liquid Level Controller (w ith Alarm and Shutdown Switch). 
Temperature Control Valve. 
Dry Sump Configuration. 
Lifting Lugs (Standard on Export Only). 
 
2.0 Crankshaft Configuration - Forged alloy steel crankshafts contain gun-drilled oil passages for 
pressurized bearing lubrication.  Crankshafts are a one-piece design with a straight shaft on the drive end.  Both two and four throw 
crankshafts have integral counterwei ghts to reduce horizontal forces 
and moments. 
 
3.0 Connecting Rod   Forged alloy steel rods are 2-piece construction that are located by 
Configuration - dowel pins and assembled with (4) four forged ferry head capscrews 
with rolled threads.  The connecting rod incorporates a gun-drilled 
squared off I-beam cross-section to allow pressurized oil lubrication 
to both the crosshead pin and shoes. 
 
4.0 Crosshead and Crosshead St andard style crosshead is a nodular iron box type with babbitted 
Pin Configuration - running surfaces.  The crosshead pin is a semi-floating hardened 
steel cylindrical type secured in place by end plates and a thru bolt.  
A dowel pin in each of the end plates prevents the rotation of the crosshead pin within the crosshead. 
 
When required, heavier style nodular iron box type crossheads with babbitted running surfaces are provided for balancing requirements.  
Positive-lock disc-type balance weight s are then bolted to the nose of 
the crosshead for reciprocating balancing of opposing throws to within (1) one pound maximum differential. 
 
5.0 Crosshead Guide Housing - Integrally cast with  frame, gasketed covers on both sides of the  
crosshead guide housing allow for the easy access to the crosshead 
and packing case assemblies.  The inside is painted with an oil proof white primer paint.  Stainless steel  fittings and stainless steel braided 
hose are used throughout. 
 
6.0 Distance Piece -  No distance piece requi red. Cylinders are close coupled to the frame. 
Similar to API Type I style. 
 
Options - Cast iron one piece design is 8.00” or 13.00” long and is sealed to 25 
psig.  Gasketed covers on both sides allow for easy access.  The 
inside is painted with an oil proof white primer paint.  Top vent and bottom drain connections are similar to API Type II style. 
 
Purged wiper assembly, oil slinger and purged packing assembly are also available. 
 
7.0 Bearings and Bushings - 
 
7.1. Frame Main Bearing - Horizontally split, prec ision steel backed copper lead tin with a micro- 
babbitt overlay (Tri-metal) replaceable shells with pressurized oil 
lubrication. 
 
Option - Main Bearing Temperature De tector system (RTD or “K” type 
thermocouple) including tube fittings, brackets and bolting with a 
terminal connection at the frame.

7.2. Frame Thrust Bearing - Two high-leaded tin bronze thrust shoes fastened to the inboard 
faces of the drive end main bearing caps 
 
7.3. Connecting Rod  Horizontally split, precis ion steel backed copper lead tin with a micro- 
Crankpin Bearing - babbitt overlay (Tri-metal) replaceable shells with pressurized oil 
lubrication, same bearing as main bearing. 
 
7.4. Connecting Rod  One piece solid bronze helical grooved bushing with a micro-babbitt 
Bushing - overly, interference fit that has been shrunk into place. 
 
8.0 Frame Lubrication - 
 
8.1. Oil Pump -  A positive displacement  gear pump is externally mounted on the 
frame end cover and is driven off the end of the crankshaft via a 
chain and sprocket arrangement.  The pump is complete with a 
pressure relief valve for cold start protection along with an oil pressure-regulating valve.  A low oil pressure shutdown switch is also 
included (for normally open or normally closed circuits). 
 
8.2. Auxiliary Oil -  An auxilia ry electric motor driven oil pu mp is required on all electric 
Pump - motor driven compressors to provide pressurized lubrication before 
start-up and after shut-down. 
 
Options - An electric motor driven oil pump is recommended to prefill all of oil 
piping and provide pressurized lubrication to the bearings prior to start-up. 
 
A hand-operated oil-priming pump is available to pre-fill all of the piping, cooler and oil filter.  It also pre-lubes the bearings and can 
build up a slight pressure in the system. 
 
8.3. Oil Piping -  Carbon steel, seamless or welded schedule 40 pipe with threaded or 
non-threaded unions.  The piping between the oil filter and oil header is stainless steel. 
 
Option - All stainless steel seamless or welded schedule 40 pipe. 
 
8.4. Oil Filter -  Frame mounted 10-micron full flow oil filter with spin on cartridge- 
type disposable element(s).  Cartridges have a collapse rating of 100-psi differential pressure. 
 
8.5. Oil Cooler -  Fixed bundle shell and tube water-cooled oil cooler.  Steel shell 
(housing), carbon steel tube sheets welded to the shell, 4 pass 
design with cast iron bonnets, se amless admiralty tubes 25 BWG, 
3/8 inch, and oil in shell. 
 
8.6. Oil Heater (optional) Immersion oil heaters are available for each of the frames.  For (4) 
four and (6) six throw frames, circulation type heaters are recommended. 
 
9.0 Crankshaft Seal Assembly - Prevents oil leakage fr om the frame.  Assembly of the seal consists 
of a split oil slinger ring clamped on the crankshaft along with a lip 
seal secured in an adjustable cover that is mounted to the frame end cover.

10.0 Tool Kit -   Consists of crosshead nut wrench, piston rod entering sleeve and  
chain drive tensioner spanner wrench.  One set provided with each frame. 
 
11.0 Cleaning and Painting -  All castings are shot bl asted, chipped and cleaned.  All of the internal 
surfaces of the frame/frame extensions, (and if required distance 
pieces) are painted with an oil-proo f white primer.  All external 
surfaces of the frame are painted with a red oxide primer. 
 
12.0 Preservation for Shipment - Lubricated Cylinder Applications  - For domestic (North America) 
applications, all of the internal components within the cylinder and 
frame are coated with a rust preven tative light oil.  For overseas 
shipments or extended storage (6+ months), the compressor frame 
and cylinder internals are coated with a heavy oil.  Critical 
components within the cylinder such  as pistons, piston rods and 
valves are removed and boxed separately for better preservation. It is recommended that most of the heavy oil preservative be removed 
prior to start-up. 
 
Special Note:  If the compressor is a domestic shipment, but the 
package is export, and the packager will be run testing the package 
in house, it is then up to the packager to ensure overseas preservation measures are taken on  the internal components of the 
compressor prior to shipment. 
 
 Non-Lube Cylinder Applications  - For domestic (North America) 
applications, aluminum paint is used in the cylinder gas passages 
and heads as a corrosion preventative.  On export shipments or extended storage, the gas passages and heads will be sprayed with 
a mineral rust preventative after the aluminum paint is applied. 
Pressure, partition packing and o il scraper rings are removed and 
placed into a grease proof, water proof, flexible barrier material 
followed by an outer wrap.  Export or extended storage also require that the piston and rod assembly be removed for shipment.  Piston 
and rider rings are also removed and packaged like the packing rings 
mentioned earlier.  The piston and piston rod are sprayed with a fingerprint neutralizer, then the piston, rod and crosshead jam nut are 
sprayed with a rust preventative and finally wrapped like the packing 
rings above. 
 
13.0 Quality Assurance -  All of the major co mponents are both visually and dimensionally 
inspected, and their material content reviewed for compliance.  Procedures are per Siemens Ener gy standard manufacturing 
specifications.  (See GFP28).  Any records generated as a result are 
maintained at the manufacturing facility. 
 
13.1. Compressor -  All running clearances and balancing are checked and verified. 
Bar over and piston rod runout checked. A (1) one-hour full speed no-load mechanical run test performed.

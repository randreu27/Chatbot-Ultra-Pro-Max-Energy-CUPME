Zero harm means 
Zero SF6
As the energy industry continues to strive for 
Net Zero, it is essential to achieve Zero Global 
Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission 
of power as well as in its generation.
That means the elimination of climate -
hostile fluorinated gases (F -gases) from
electrical switchgear –especially SF6. 
Recent EU legislation has restricted the use 
of these gases, with a full ban likely in the 
near future . Clean air insulation with vacuum 
switching technology is the way forward, 
since this involves Zero greenhouse gases of 
any kind and has Zero harmful impact on the 
environment.
The clean air technology used in the Siemens 
Energy Blue portfolio is well proven and 
already in operation worldwide –with the 
3AV1 Blue live tank being a prime example of 
how using Zero F -gases means Zero 
compromise on performance.
Extensive experience
The technology is long established. We have 
40 years of experience in producing medium -
voltage vacuum interrupters suitable for 
power networks up to 52 kV, and this 
capability has been extended to the high -
voltage 145 kV level.
Prototypes of these breakers began to 
operate on a number of sites in 2010, and 
the 3AV1 model has been in production since 
2017 with more than 150 units delivered 
worldwide.Like all our circuit breakers, the 3AV1 LT is 
designed using a tried and tested modular 
platform concept. The operating mecha -
nism , control system, base frame, kinematic 
chain and insulator designs are based on 
decades of manufacturing and operating 
experience.
High -voltage, high -
performing vacuum 
technology
The 3AV1 delivers the high levels of 
performance and reliability our customers 
have come to expect from our circuit 
breakers:
•Reliable making and breaking capabilities
•30 full short -circuit current interruptions
•10,000 rated current interruptions
•Optional 2 -cycle current interruption
•Full performance down to -60°C ambient 
temperature
•Zero -maintenance interrupter unit 
(full lifetime)
•Tested in accordance with IEC 62271 -100, 
-110, -310
With Zero F -gases and Zero compromise on 
performance, the 3AV1 Blue Live Tank circuit 
breaker is helping to make a greener grid 
achievable.Zero environmental

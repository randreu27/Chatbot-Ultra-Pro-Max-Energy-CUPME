•Coal will be phased out
Energy efficiency will be a 
competitive criteria across 
industries due to
•Higher cost
•Volatility of supply
•Regional differences Grid investment will rise to 
unprecedented levels
•Sustainable modernization
of an ageing grid
•Ensure grid reliability and 
resiliency of a complex network
•Safely connect an ever -

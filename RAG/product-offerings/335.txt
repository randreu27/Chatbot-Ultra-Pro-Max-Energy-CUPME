Siemens Energy is committed to driving this potential into real growth for the future of renewable power and offers a whole range of power transmission equipment, grid access solutions and services for the wind industry. Press Pictures Siemens Energy delivered 114 low-loss 66kV distribution transformers for the Seagreen Offshore Wind Farm in Scotland. The solution has been specifically designed to pass through the opening in the tower base without disassembly. Earlier Siemens Energy’s compact transformers also helped to enable the Deutsche Bucht offshore wind farm (in the picture) in the German North Sea, together with MHI Vestas Offshore Wind. The offshore platform of the grid connection BorWin3 in the picture can transmit up to 900 megawatts of wind energy, enough to supply over one million German households. A growing number and size of offshore wind parks require efficient and sustainable systems for power transmission. Siemens Energy is committed to driving the potential of offshore wind energy into real growth for the future of renewable power and offers a whole range of power transmission products and systems, turnkey solutions, and services for the wind industry. In October 2021, Siemens Energy has been awarded its first offshore grid connection project in the United States. In a consortium with Aker Solutions, the company will supply the high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system that will bring green energy from Sunrise Wind, New York’s first utility-scale offshore wind project, to the mainland. The offshore converter station in the picture will collect the alternating current power generated by the wind turbines and transform it to direct current.

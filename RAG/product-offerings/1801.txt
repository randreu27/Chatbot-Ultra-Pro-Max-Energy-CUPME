of critical heat flux at very low 
mass flux in smooth tubes
Recent measurements recorded at the Benson laboratory 
in Erlangen are believed to represent the first successful 
determination of critical heat flux (CHF) in Benson 
evaporator tubes over a wide pressure range at mass flux 
levels below 100 kg/(m²s) and as low as 30 kg/(m²s). The 
research has closed a significant gap in our understanding 
of CHF and wall temperatures at these low mass fluxes. 
Martin Effert and Jan Brückner, Siemens, Germany
Siemens has been granting the so-
called Benson licence since the 1930s 
to leading global manufacturers of 
once-through boilers. This licence has been 
modified and further developed as a matter 
of course over the decades. For example, 
while specific support was provided on 
questions of design in the early years, efforts 
since the mid-1970s have focused on correct 
thermohydraulic design of the evaporator 
and the startup system.
Since the mid 1970s, countless test 
series have been conducted at the world’s 
largest test facility for measurements of 
pressure drop and heat transfer in the 
two-phase regime, located in the Benson 
laboratory in Erlangen.1 The results of 
these tests were integrated in calculation 
programs that enabled the licensees and 
the Siemens engineers to design these 
critical components of a boiler for operating 
reliability.
Motivation for tests
In addition to the correct calculation of 
heat transfer and wall temperatures, taking into account the flow distribution in the 
evaporator heat exchange surfaces, flow 
stability must also be checked and ensured. 
A distinction is drawn here between what 
is known as static stability and dynamic 
stability. In the static stability analysis, a 
check is done as to whether individual tubes 
or groups of tubes can have more than one 
operating point. In a series of pressure drop 
calculations, it is determined whether more 
than one mass flow rate is possible at an 
identical pressure drop defined by the inlet 
and outlet headers, which can then result in 
widely different outlet temperatures.
The physical phenomena associated with 
and the theoretical basis for the dynamic 
stability of two-phase flows have been 
investigated, understood and documented 
in the context of the Benson licence. 
Fluctuations measured in a power plant 
had already by the mid 1980s been correctly 
calculated quantitatively using non-linear 
simulation.2,3
A test stand with tubes configured 
in parallel was installed in the Benson 
laboratory in Erlangen in 2014 for further investigation of the phenomenon. For the 
first time in the world, this setup enabled the 
reproducible generation and observation 
under laboratory conditions of dynamic 
instabilities in vertically configured heated 
tubes with a geometry typical of Benson 
evaporators. The purpose of the tests was 
to destabilise an initially stable flow in 
the tubes by changing a parameter and to 
generate a sustained mass flow oscillation. 
This stability threshold was investigated in 
many measurement periods with variation 
of the parameters of pressure, mass flux, 
subcooling at the inlet and superheating 
at the outlet. Graph 1 shows a measured 
flow oscillation in the three parallel smooth 
tubes of the test system at a system 
pressure of 80 bar and a mean mass flux of 
206 kg/(m²s).
Recalculations for stable or unstable 
operating phases with mass flux levels 
significantly below 100 kg/(m²s) revealed 
deviations from the measured tube wall 
temperatures. In particular, the calculated 
location of the boiling crisis deviated 
significantly from that observed in the 
3-tube inlet section and vertical section at the Benson laboratory

inner wall of the tube is no longer wetted. A 
distinction is drawn between the departure 
from nucleate boiling (DNB), dryout of the 
heat exchange surface and deposition-
controlled dryout. The type of boiling crisis 
occurring in an evaporator tube depends 
on the degree of thermal loading (heat flux 
relative to mass flux) and on the system 
pressure.
The occurrence of the boiling crisis is 
always associated with an increase in 
tube wall temperature. Knowledge of the 
location of occurrence of the boiling crisis as 
well as the associated increase in material 
temperature is therefore extremely important 
for the design of the heat exchange surfaces.
The occurrence of the boiling crisis 
and the resulting wall temperatures are 
calculated in the Benson programs taking 
into consideration tube geometry, heat input 
and the physical properties of the water/
steam flow. The database for the Benson test 
system previously ended at the minimum 
mass flux of 100 kg/(m²s) indicated above. A 
series of heat transfer tests with a smooth 
tube at the lowest possible mass fluxes was 
therefore necessary to enable conclusive 
recalculation of the completed dynamic 
stability tests at still lower mass flux.
Outside the Benson licence, lookup tables 
with values of critical heat flux (CHF) are 
used. One of the latest lookup tables is 
based on roughly 24 000 critical heat flux 
values and is normalised for a water-cooled 
tube with an inside diameter of 8 mm. 
Due to a lack of reliable data the region 
corresponding to a mass flux of less than 
100 kg/(m²s) exhibits large uncertainties in 
this table.4 In the lookup table from 20065, 
Groeneveld and his colleagues extended 
the database and improved the predictive 
accuracy of the values for critical heat flux. 
However, the authors note even for this 
most current table that the range of lowest 
mass flux is not reliably covered.
None of the lookup tables covers the 
pressure range above 210 bar.
Test setup, test matrix, test procedure
The setup of the Benson test system1 for 
the dynamic stability investigation briefly 
described above was modified for a single-
tube test.
The test matrix focused on the lower 
mass flux range. Extensive heat transfer 
tests were performed in the pressure range 
between 40 bar and 175 bar, at mass flux 
levels from 30 kg/(m²s) and internal heat 
fluxes from 20 kW/m². It proved necessary 
for the operating personnel in the control 
room to be extraordinarily patient to obtain 
a settled steady-state condition as the initial 
basis for each test point. Many test points 
were retested on different days to check the 
reproducibility of the test results. 
A further parameter range that was 
investigated focused on the pressure 
range between 200 bar and 220 bar, in order to validate the existing correlations 
in the Benson programs in the near-critical 
pressure range (cf. also ref 6).
A total of 24 500 data points was recorded 
in the course of the extensive test series. 
These are now available for analysis and 
checking or improvement of the existing 
correlations for internal heat transfer.
Selected results and their evaluation
Graph 2 shows a small selection of 
measured critical heat fluxes for various 
pressures at a constant mass flux lying 
significantly below 100 kg/(m²s). The critical 
steam quality calculated using the Benson 
program Wathun is also shown along with 
the measured data.
A point entered in the diagram for a 
pressure level indicates the combination of 
heat flux and steam quality up to which the 
inside of the tube is wetted.While Wathun calculates the occurrence 
of the boiling crisis at the mass flux from the 
tests independently from heat input close to 
steam quality 1, the measurements exhibit 
highly deviating results that are strongly 
dependent on pressure.
Graph 3 shows the temperature profile 
measured along the outside of the tube for 
one of the tests, the inner wall temperature 
calculated based on the measured values 
and the inner wall temperature calculated 
by Wathun. These values are plotted against 
enthalpy or steam quality. It can be seen 
in this plot that Wathun does not correctly 
calculate the location of the boiling crisis and 
that the tube wall temperature measured 
in the post-CHF region is higher than that 
calculated by Wathun.
There is thus a clear potential for 
improvement in the calculation of wall 
temperatures by Wathun at mass flux levels

exhibits nearly perfect agreement of the 
calculated location of the boiling crisis 
as well as in the increase in tube wall 
temperature in the post-CHF region within 
the validated area.
Practical relevance, summary, 
outlook
We believe that the measurements reported 
above represent the first successful 
determination of values for critical heat flux 
over a broad pressure range at mass flux 
levels between 30 kg/(m²s) and 100 kg/(m²s).
The new knowledge obtained from the 
tests and initial analysis are not only of 
scientific interest. They are of practical 
relevance, even though the lowest steady-
state evaporator mass flux in pulverised coal 
fired boilers with spiral winding is roughly 
800 kg/(m²s) and even circulating fluidised 
bed systems are not operated at mean mass 
flux levels in the evaporator significantly below 200 kg/(m²s). The mean evaporator 
mass flux in Benson heat recovery steam 
generators with vertical exhaust flow and 
horizontal heat exchange tubes is also 
roughly 200 kg/(m²s) at the lowest part load 
level. Only in the coldest tube row in heat 
recovery steam generators with a horizontal 
gas path can the mass flux drop down to 
values of 20 kg/(m²s) at steady-state.
However, fluctuations in the mass flux can 
be so large on the occurrence of a dynamic 
instability in any of the above evaporators 
that even flow reversal of the fluid into the 
inlet header can occur. Dynamic calculation 
programs in particular must therefore 
correctly represent all mass fluxes up to 
the point of stagnation of the fluid. If the 
location of the boiling crisis and the wall 
temperature are incorrectly calculated 
by the programs, the energy term input 
to and output from the tube wall is also 
incorrectly calculated by the dynamic tools. 
Furthermore, representation of the mass flow distribution in the evaporator network 
can also be insufficiently accurate under 
these circumstances, which in turn has an 
unfavourable effect on the determination of 
stability limits.
It is therefore anticipated that the stability 
limit in the dynamic tools will shift on 
implementation of the new heat transfer 
equations.
The test results are currently being 
analysed in detail and the equations and 
functions for heat transfer in the steady-
state and dynamic programs are being 
adjusted based on these results. 
The described measurements have 
succeeded in closing an important 
knowledge gap regarding the critical heat 
flux and wall temperatures in the post-CHF 
regime at mass fluxes below 100 kg/(m²s). 
These data will be available to Benson 
licensees and Siemens boiler engineers in 
the form of revised design programs in the 
near future. MPSReferences

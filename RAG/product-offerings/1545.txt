Internal challenges: Main root causes for underperformance identified …Key challenges: Internal
•Delays in Siemens Gamesa 5.X product development 
process, not adhering to early milestones , resulting in
delayed product availability, quality problems and additional 
unplanned costs
•Significant business complexity: Broad product portfolio, 
still limited degree of standardization and modularization
•High production costs , partially driven by low utilization 
of existing manufacturing capacities
•Complexity of IT system/ tools transformation•Very strong market prospects ,recent geopolitical events 
further accelerating decarbonization process
•Growing service business
•Price increase & risk sharing to customers ; trend ongoing 
from all OEMs to ensure sustainability
•Competitive product portfolio in OF and ON (including

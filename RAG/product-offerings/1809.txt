Delivering Zero with 
Zero delay
Renewable energy sources are only part of 
the solution as we aim for the 
decarbonization of the energy sector.
It’s essential that we achieve Zero Global 
Warming Potential (GWP) in the 
transmission of power as well as in
its generation.
Most switchgear still uses SF6for insulation 
–a gas 24,300 times more climate -hostile
than CO2and one which stays in the 
atmosphere for up to 1,000 years.
Recognizing the harmfulness of this and 
other F -gases, the EU has legislated to 
restrict their use and allows only GWP < 1 
solutions if available.
By contrast, our future -ready Blue portfolio, 
including our gas -insulated busducts, uses 
Zero fluorinated gases of any kind and has 
Zero harmful impact on the environment.Zero SF6–just clean air
The sustainable, Zero harm alternative to 
SF6is clean air. This is the only way to 
achieve Zero GWP.
The Blue gas -insulated busducts operate 
with clean air insulation. This means Zero 
harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with 
Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero 
safety requirements during handling and 
maintenance.
The clean air used –consisting of 80% 
nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and free 
of humidity –can be released into the 
atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to 
people or the environment.
At the same time, the busducts maintain the 
highest standards of technical performance 
and reliability, together with low lifecycle 
costs. They are capable of handling voltages 
up to 420 kV –while the handling, 
transportation and operation
of the units require Zero special training.Vacuum technologyBlue Gas-Insulated BusductsTM

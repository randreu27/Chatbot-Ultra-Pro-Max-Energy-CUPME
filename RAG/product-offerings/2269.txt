Versatility and Performance
Our 11-inch (279 mm) stroke ESH single-
throw, reciprocating compressor is designed 
for long-term, process gas service. Built in 
accordance with API-618 specifications. 
Whether direct-connected or belt-driven,  
the ESH can handle a variety of drivers up  
to 200 hp (149 kW) and can be fitted with 
either lubricated or non-lubricated cylinders 
from 2.125 to 28 inches (54 to 711 mm) in 
bore diameter. The ESH is also available in  
a vertical arrangement that greatly reduces 
the foundation size and area. In its vertical 
configuration, the “ESV” provides significant 
advantage where space may be limited.Designed and Built with Precision
With its fine-grain, cast iron frame, the  
ESH is engineered to provide the required 
support for the running gear and related 
components. The rigid frame design and 
counterweighted crankshaft minimize 
vibration and provide for low moments and 
minimal foundation requirements. Forged 
from high tensile strength alloy steel, the 
crankshaft is fully stress relieved and heat-
treated. The bearing journals and crankpin 
are ground with precision and polished to 
meet exacting tolerances.The ESH reciprocating process 
compressor provides an 
economical solution where limited 
space and continuous, low-volume 
service is a requirement. Its proven 
performance, versatile design, 
and wide range of cylinder 
selections make the ESH an 
obvious choice for a variety  
of applications.

main and crankpin bearings are 
generously sized for best run-in and 
long-lasting service. All bearings are 
force-lubricated per API-618 
specifications. Connecting rods are 
die-forged steel with rifle-drilled 
passages for positive lubrication of the 
crosshead pin and bushing. The standard 
crossheads are nodular iron, equipped 
with adjustable aluminum shoes at the 
top and bottom. Cast steel crossheads 
are also available.

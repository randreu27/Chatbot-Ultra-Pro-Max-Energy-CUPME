at this address.  Instead , we will be consolidating all of our inventory at our facility in Montreal , close to the manufacturing of

Those of you who are currently using UPS or TNT to transport  your shipments to our UK consolidator (K&N) will continue to 
do so with the same process, simply make the changes to you shipping paperwork to reflect the new final destination 
address above.  
 
Those  vendors that were shipping directly to the TKA facility previously should now ship directly to the Montreal facility using the 
same courier arrangements.  The only change is the final destination address.   As both the old and the new destination are in 
Canada no changes to the transportation se rvice providers or any other logistics related arrangements are required or expected.  
 
Please not e that these changes do not affect in any way your current shipments to Industrial Turbine Company (UK) Ltd., c/o 
Schenker Ltd at Kelsey Close, Attleborough Fi elds Industrial Estate, Nuneaton, CV11 6XN United Kingdom.  
 
If you have any questions please contact either myself at jay.jacobs@siemens.com  or the applicable MRPC responsible for your 
portfolio of parts.

Summary & How to partner

Gas Power Plants operating with Decarbonized Fuels will ensure Security of 
Supply by providing Residual Load in grids largely dominated by Renewables
3 Unrestricted © Siemens Energy, 2025 | 1stEU Innovation Conference 2025 2025 -03-26Residual Load Definition
Remaining load required to bridge the gap between demand 
and renewable energy production at any point in time. 
Characteristics of Residual Load
•For regions with high RES penetration, the residual load demand 
may drop to 15 –25% of the hours of the year
•New build residual load gas power plants must be ready to be upgraded 
to decarbonized fuels (e.g., hydrogen, bio -or e-fuels) as soon as these 
fuels become available 
•Future RES load surpluses will increasingly be used to produce 
the H2required for later re -electrification especially to cover seasonal 
RES variationsActual data from 2022

Long Duration Residual Load Events are expected to increase due to more 
long -lasting stable weather condition events

“Dark doldrum” event January 2017
Same event with simulated 86% RES coverage
1 Study Lehmann/ Coumou , Nature Scientific Reports (2015) There are prolonged “dark 
doldrum” periods of 3 –4 weeks 
with a continuous lack of sun 
and wind, which will also
persist in the future.
Due to climate change, climate 
experts1predict more frequent 
and longer persistent weather 
events, making residual load 
events lasting longer in future.Conclusions
1.These long -term residual load events require a 
suitable level of capacity of gas -fired power 
plants operating with H2(batteries are not 
suited for such long durations)
2.Residual load shows significant seasonality; in 
colder countries 
it tends to happen in winter, creating 
simultaneously a 
“residual heat” event 
3.As a consequence , residual load plants should 
include Cogeneration wherever feasible!

Hydrogen does not produce CO2emissions, but challenging 
physical properties require rapid design and testing cycles
7•H2embrittlement requires upgrade to stainless steel materials  
•Lower volumetric energy content requires larger flows to be handled by 
the fuel system 
•Higher diffusivity requires changes/re -certification of sealing and flanges
•Higher reactivity and flame velocity pushes flame towards burner 
and increases risk of flashbacks
•Higher flame temperature can lead to local hotspots if imperfectly mixed 
and thus increased NOxemissions
High -pressure testing 
at engine conditions
High-pressure burner tests

5Gas turbines, CCPPs and CHP Plants are indispensable technologies for providing 
carbon -neutral residual power and heat in a future decarbonized energy landscape
While hydrogen is the most attractive carbon -neutral fuel for gas turbines, 
local conditions may require other green fuels as an alternative
Both biogenic fuels and hydrogen derivatives can act as alternative carbon -neutral 
fuels and can be easily transported and stored onsite in liquid form
Siemens Energy is working on fielding a comprehensive green fuel capability 
for its turbines, based on hydrogen, biofuels and hydrogen derivates
Inthe case of e -ammonia, Siemens Energy is prioritizing an optimized integration of 
ammonia cracker units.

Decarbonization  of Gas Turbines  with Hydrogen and Green Fuels 
Frida Björneld / Ghenadie Bulat
Overview
The workshop, held over the course of one hour, featured insightful presentations and engaging discussions on decarbonization of Gas Turbines with Hydrogen and Green Fuels.
Participants from various backgrounds came together to share their perspectives and expertise, creating a dynamic and collabo rative learning environment.
Presentations
• Frida Björneld lead the introduction to the SE GS strategy and new product portfolio for Gast turbines operation on Hydrogen and green fuels
• Ghenadie Bulat: lead facilitate the panel discussion 
Discussions
Morning Session:
•Business Case Representation: Decisions on investing in alternative fuels cannot be secured without well -prepared business cases. However, if there is longer visibility of upcoming 
projects expected to generate revenue, a different approach might be considered.
•Legislation and Fuel Availability: Clearer legislation and fuel availability are needed to support investment decisions and maintain energy security. This inclu dessupply chain 
readiness and legislative lobbying.
•Focus on Options: There is a lack of focus on fuel and the lifecycle of solution options, which do not provide a clear roadmap .
Afternoon Session:
•Technical Challenges: Discussions centered around the technical challenges of adopting new fuels and the operational requirements of adapted or new products.
•Fuel Availability and Flexibility: Long -term facilities and supply chain planning face difficulties in foreseeing fuel availability and type at the time.
•Regulatory Constraints: Actions to accelerate and lobbying mechanisms were discussed, with university participants highlighting the use of new lobbyi ngtools 
•Participant Diversity: The workshop featured a diverse pool of participants with different approaches and interests, including utilities, academics, and a few suppliers.

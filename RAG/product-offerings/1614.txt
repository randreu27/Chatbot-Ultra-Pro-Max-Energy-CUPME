 4Products and solutions supporting power on demand are intended 
to enhance Start and Stop Performance and can include upgrades 
designed to decrease waiting times for water-steam cycle warm-
up, decrease or even eliminate holding times and increase ramp 
rates of steam turbines (ST) and/or gas turbines (GT).01
Start and Stop 
Performance
A shortened start-up or shutdown time may not only 
increase flexibility, but also support a reduction of fuel 
consumption and associated emissions in these 
operating conditions.
Start and Stop Performance
 5Intended benefits
After an overnight shutdown, operators might be 
forced to restart in an unprofitable spark spread 
time period with poor gas turbine part load effi-
ciency. Hot Start on the Fly can help to reduce 
start-up costs by a 4-digit amount per hot start.Benefits in a nutshell
• Increased start-up efficiency
• Significantly reduced combined cycle start-  
up time
• Higher plant load transients due to com-
bination of GT & ST load output, resulting in 
reduced specific start-up costs
• Minimized fuel consumption for start-up
• Reduced CO-emissions during start-upScope
After an extensive assessment of the 
component limits Siemens Energy 
 implements the modification, such as: 
• New high pressure and hot reheat  control 
philosophy
• Modifications within unit master control 
and major component subsystems
• Implementation of logic changes into the 
plant’s digital control systemHot Start on the Fly

A start-up from warm conditions may take 
considerable time for a power plant originally 
built for less volatile operating profiles. In 
competitive markets, the ability to start up your 
plant faster from shutdown can help reduce time 
spent in transient conditions with non-optimal 
efficiency and make a difference in dispatch.• Increased start-up efficiency

 10Advanced preservation concepts and the ability to maintain a 
plant in a status which allows fast re-start even after multiple 
days of shutdown may greatly enhance flexibility and support 
better dispatch success.02
Start Readiness 
and Cool Down
Reduced cool-down times may support faster access to  
components for inspections and repairs, thus supporting 
shorter outages.
Advanced inspection and interval concepts can help to 
safeguard and enhance availability.
Start Readiness and Cool Down
 11The more cooled down key plant components are 
after a shutdown, the longer the next start takes 
due to necessary times for achieving relevant 
criteria for e.g. pressures, steam flow, steam 
purity, warm-up, etc. In addition, life consump-
tion for thick walled components is typically 
higher for cold starts. Already after a relatively 
short shutdown, temporary preservation 
measures are typically recommended to avoid or 
limit corrosion impact, which may need signifi-
cant time to set up and revert prior to next start. 
Consequently, flexibility and responsiveness for a 
start after an extended shutdown can potentially 
be severely limited. Intended benefits Scope
• Plant-specific engineering evaluation of 
boundaries and components as needed
• Selection of modules and features based   
on engineering evaluation and customer 
 objectives
• Engineering of necessary adaptations and  
of enhanced process logic
• Automation and logic modifications within 
unit master control and major component 
subsystems
• On-site implementation, operator training  
and documentationGo-Ready
• Keep key components warm or delay cool-
down
• Reduce setup time for and partially automate 
temporary preservation
• Reduce preparation time and effort ahead of 
next start such that start-up time and life 
 consumption for the next start are possibly 
comparable to a warm start even after up to 
two weeks of standstillGo-Ready is a comprehensive and 
modular solution which aims to:
Start Readiness and Cool Down
 12Days of availability can be impacted by steam 
turbine cool-down times, impacting the opportu-
nity to generate power. With the steam turbine 
fast cooling upgrade, the I&C system is updated 
with an automated cool-down control procedure, 
using the latest  optimized parameters for cool-
down gradients. The steam turbine fast cooling 
reduces off grid times and with that improves 
plant availability.Scope
Fast cooling system enhancement options  
consisting of:
• Engineering solution package including 
 required I&C software changes
• Depending on customer specific requirements 
and project scope, examples of additional 
optional scope may include:
 - Strainer and blind flanges
 - Installation services, provided by  
  Siemens Energy field service personnel
• Training
• Documentation updateFast cooling of steam turbines
This upgrade can help to: 
• Save up to 3½ days of outage time related to  
cool-downs compared to natural cool-downs
• Increase availability
•  Reduce outage costsIntended benefits

LIntended benefits
Steam turbine standstills can lead to increased 
exposure to air moisture which can result in parts 
corrosion. Preservation measures are recom-
mended to remove and control residual moisture 
to below recommended thresholds. Siemens 
Energy has developed an enhanced preservation 
system for steam turbines and its auxiliaries to 
support more flexible shutdowns and longer 
standstills. This enhanced dry air system has been 
designed to help:
• Reduce the potential for corrosion and result-
ing damage during shutdowns, contributing to 
improved reliability
• Reduce time and effort for installing and dis-
connecting the preservation system after shut-
down and during start preparations
• Support better responsiveness and availa bility 
through reduced time for connecting / discon-
necting to the dry air supply
• Enhance installation ease through redesigned 
and relocated access points
• Better control of preservation operation 
through automation and measuring points

 16Benefits of Turn Down
• Improved turn down operations
• Optimization of Minimum Environmental Load
• Maintaining CO emissions limits while on  
low load
• Potential to continue plant operations during 
low demand periods, instead of shutdown
• Reduced operational costsIntended benefits
In the contemporary energy market, there’s a 
growing necessity to optimize part load opera-
tion in power plants. Traditionally, gas turbines 
have been designed for base load conditions.  
The changing market dynamics now require them 
to operate efficiently even at low load conditions 
while complying with CO emissions limits. To 
solve these challenges, the Turn Down solution 
was developed, which helps to give the power 
plant the operational flexibility it needs. Turn Down

influx of new generation assets like renewables, microgrids and the 
hybridization of traditional CCPPs with storage and other energy 
assets. All of which makes it more difficult for asset operators to

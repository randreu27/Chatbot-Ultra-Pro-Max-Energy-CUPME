We are increasing the efficiency of our transmission technologies to transport renewable energy to consumers faster, over longer distances, more reliably and with lower losses. In addition, we are expanding our market leading portfolio of SF6-free transmission products and systems. With the blue portfolio we are defining new and exceptionally stringent criteria that far exceed the scope of current safety and environmental standards setting the pace in decarbonization efforts. We are supporting our customers on their path towards decarbonization by offering efficient, reliable products and solutions that reduce both - emissions and costs. Latest news We proudly unveil our new vacuum interrupter factory in Berlin, a testament to our commitment to driving innovation and sustainability in the evolving energy landscape. With vacuum interrupters with clean air insulation for grid decarbonization, we are leading the charge towards a brighter, cleaner tomorrow. Discover more By 2040, the global grid is expected to double, requiring over a hundred thousand transformers for the transmission grid and significantly impacting the environment through raw material use. By successfully signing a Letter of Intent with our partner TenneT at our transformer factory in Nuremberg, we at Siemens Energy Grid Technologies are committed to mitigating these impacts. Our partnership with TenneT aims to lead the way in integrating sustainable practices and developing greener products for the energy transition – with a target of reducing our combined GHG footprint by 30% until 2030, utilizing sustainable materials and decarbonizing our factory network, adopting innovative technologies and assessing the potential for circularity models in grid technologies.

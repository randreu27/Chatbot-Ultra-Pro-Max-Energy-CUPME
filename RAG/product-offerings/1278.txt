 Update to the Declaration of Conformity by the Executive Board and the  
Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy AG  with the German Corporate  
Governance Code pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act  
Siemens Energy AG submitted a  declaration of conformity with the recommendations 
of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code in the 
version dated April 28, 2022, as published by the Federal Ministry of Justice in the 
official section of the Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ) most recently in September 
2023. That declaration is updated as follows:  
The guarantee pledged by the Federal Republic of Germany in December 2023 (the 
government guarantee ) precludes variable compensation for the members of the  
Executive Board for the fiscal years between 2024 and 2026 , provided that  guarantees 
secured by the government guarantee are issued within these fiscal years .  
Accordingly, no variable compensation within the meaning of Section G of the Code is 
granted for the respective fiscal years .  
Apart from that, the Declaration of Conformity from September 2023 remains un-
changed.

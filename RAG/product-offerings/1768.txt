Overview 
Oil & Gas Manager (OGM) is an industry leading modeling, 
evaluation, planning, and decision support software solution 
for global application in the oil and gas industry.  It is the 
solution for concept development screening and design for 
greenfield and brownfield developments.  It enables the user 
to estimate lifecycle CAPEX/OPEX costs and optimize them 
based on alternative field development plan options.
How can OGM be used?
With OGM, Owner/Operators and their advisors (EPCs and 
consulting firms) can:  
•  Evaluate prospects, conduct screening studies, and optimize 
concepts
•  Leverage an up-to-date worldwide cost database that can 
be updated as needed
•  Leverage the built-in thermodynamic-based heat and mass 
balance simulation to design and size production assets
• Generate complete lifecycle field CAPEX and OPEX costs
•  Collaborate to consolidate design and cost estimating 
practices to improve consistency
•  Benchmark existing in production assets to re-use for similar 
new or modified developments
•  Significantly reduce manhours and schedule for concept 
screening, design, and optimization while maintaining 
consistency and an auditable trail of decisions Software Capabilities
OGM is an integrated solution that covers onshore and 
offshore oil and gas developments for both conventional and 
some unconventional assets.

footprint assessmentOGM is built on the latest technology standards incorporating 
a building block layout and simulator with the ability to create 
re-usable design templates for various development concepts, 
enhancing a company’s efficiency.  
Access to OGM via the cloud minimizes company IT effort and 
cost.  Alternatively, OGM can be deployed on a standalone 
computer or a company network.
Who can benefit from using OGM?
OGM can be utilized as an enterprise concept development 
planning solution with collaborative use across many 
functions from engineering, development planning, 
estimating, project management, and company management.
Example Use Cases
•  A company is preparing a bid for an oil & gas block and 
needs to determine if economically feasible to develop the 
block.  As part of a feasibility study, high-level lifecycle costs 
must be estimated for several production.
The company can save hundreds of engineering manhours 
using OGM’s predefined facility templates for offshore and 
onshore upstream oil and gas facilities to quickly generate 
concept level sizing and cost estimates with limited input 
data.
•  A company has an existing oil & gas production facility 
with declining reserves and needs to examine alternative 
hydrocarbon recovery concepts to increase or maintain 
production and assess potential bottlenecks in the existing 
facility.
OGM can help the company quickly compare the current 
design capacity versus the required capacity to identify 
bottlenecks, visualize upgrades, and do a first pass analysis  
of the size and cost of the required upgrades.

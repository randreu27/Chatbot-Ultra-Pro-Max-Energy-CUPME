The world needs a more diversified energy mix and a massive expansion of renewable energies – along with corresponding infrastructure, and storage capacities to meet the growing demand for electrical power and heat. While many industries require tailored approaches that complement their processes, there are selected technologies that can be applied in several industries, e.g., hydrogen applications. And others, like digital or storage solutions, are applicable to many, if not the majority of industrial sectors. All of these technologies support and drive the energy transition and the goal to make energy reliable, affordable and sustainable. As a global leader in energy technology, we are committed to  supporting our customers  to reduce their carbon footprint and achieve their sustainability goals, and to build a greener, more resilient future. Energy transition in action with energy solutions by use case Haru Oni: The world’s first industrial-scale facility for carbon-neutral fuel Innovative, climate-relevant technologies at one location The Haru Oni plant, near the city of Punta Arenas in southern Chile, combines wind power, water, and CO2 to make e-methanol and ultimately electricity-based carbon-neutral gasoline. Siemens Energy designed and led the system integration of HIF Global’s pilot plant in collaboration with Porsche and other partners.

The Ecodesign Directive from the European Commission 
takes effect for transformers Tier 2 in July 2021.
The regulations started throughout Europe from July 
2015 with Tier 1.1. General information
Name of the directive:
Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/1783 of October 1st, 2019
amending Regulation (EU) 548/2014 of May 21st, 2014 on 
implementing Directive 2009/125/EC of the European 
Parliament and of the Council with regard to small, 
medium and large power transformers
Scope of application:
small, medium and large power transformers
Contents:
The Ecodesign Guideline defines a framework for the 
requirements for the environmentally friendly design of 
energy consumption-relevant products.  The objectives 
include improved energy efficiency and a general environ-
mental compatibility and thus the reduction of CO 2 emis-
sions.
Batch E2 addresses the transformers product group. Based 
on a preparatory study, specific ecodesign standards for 
transformers were defined by the European Commission 
which have now been introduced in the new implementa-
tion directive. In principle, the new directive should affect 
an increase in the degree of effectiveness by 20 %.siemens.com/energy/transformersEU requirements

Ecodesign Directive from the European 
Commission
Tier 2 - July 1st, 2021
Exceptions:
The directive does not apply to transformers solely  
designed and implemented for the following purposes:
a.) instrument transformers, specifically designed to 
transmit an information signal to measuring instru -
ments, meters and protective or control devices or 
similar apparatus;
b.) transformers specifically designed and intended to 
provide a DC power supply to electronic or rectifier 
loads. This exemption does not include transformers 
that are intended to provide an AC supply from DC 
sources such as transformers for wind turbine and 
photovoltaic applications or transformers designed for 
DC transmission and distribution applications;
c.) transformers specifically designed to be directly  
connected to a furnace;
d.) transformers specifically designed to be installed on 
fixed or floating offshore platforms, offshore wind 
turbines or on-board ships and all kinds of vessels; 
e.) transformers specifically designed to provide for a 
situation limited in time when the normal power 
supply is interrupted due to either an unplanned  
occurrence (such as a power failure) or a station  
refurbishment, but not to permanently upgrade an 
existing substation; 
f.) transformers (with separate or auto-connected wind -
ings) connected to an AC or DC contact line, directly or 
through a converter, used in fixed installations for 
railway applications;
g.) earthing or grounding transformers specifically de -
signed to be connected in a power system to provide a 
neutral connection for earthing either directly or via an 
impedance;
h.) traction transformers specifically designed to be 
mounted on rolling stock, connected to an AC or DC 
contact line, directly or through a converter, for spe -
cific use in fixed installations for railway applications;i.) starting transformers, specifically designed for starting 
three-phase induction motors to eliminate supply 
voltage dips and that remain de-energised during 
normal operation; 
j.) testing transformers, specifically designed to be used 
in a circuit to produce a specific voltage or current for 
the purpose of testing electrical equipment;
k.) welding transformers, specifically designed for use  
in arc--welding equipment or resistance-welding  
equipment; 
l.) transformers specifically designed for explosion-proof 
applications in accordance with Directive 94/9/EC of the 
European Parliament and of the Council3 and under -
ground mining applications;
m.) transformers specifically designed for deep water 
(submerged) applications; 
n.) medium Voltage (MV) to Medium Voltage (MV) inter -
face transformers up to 5 MVA used as interface trans -
formers used in a network voltage conversion program 
and placed at the junction between two voltage levels 
of two medium voltage networks and that need to be 
able to cope with emergency overloads; 
o.) medium and large power transformers specifically 
designed to contribute to the safety of nuclear installa -
tions, as defined in Article 3 of Council Directive 
2009/71/Euratom4;
p.) three-phase medium power transformers with a power 
rating below 5 kVA,
This does not pertain to the requirements for product

2. Important change with review of regulation October 1st, 2019
Note:
Definitions indicated in this chapter refer to definitions 
originally made in EU regulation review October 1st, 2019.
This document shows only the important topics of the 
regulation, please read full text of regulation and review 
for further details
Medium and large power transformers, regardless of when 
they were first placed on the market or put into service, 
shall be reassessed for conformity and comply with this 
Regulation, if they are subject to all of the following 
operations:
a) replacement of the core or part thereof;
b)  replacement of one or more of the complete windings.
This is without prejudice to the legal obligations under 
other Union’s harmonization legislation that these 
products could be subject to.
Product definition per regulation:
¡ ‘Medium power transformer’ means a power transformer
with all windings having rated power lower than orequal to 3 150 kVA, and highest voltage for equipment 
greater than 1,1 kV and lower than or equal to 36 kV
¡ ‘Large power transformer’ means a power transformer 
with at least one winding having either rated power 
greater than 3 150 kVA or highest voltage for equipment 
greater than 36 kV
¡ ‘Medium power pole-mounted transformer’ means a 
power transformer with a rated power of up to 400 kVA
suitable for outdoor service and specifically designed to 
be mounted on the support structures of overhead 
power line
¡ ‘Declared value(s)’ mean the values given in the techni-
cal documentation pursuant to point 2 of Annex IV to
Directive 2009/125/EC, and where applicable, the values 
used to calculate these values
¡ The Commission shall review this Regulation in the light 
of technological progress and shall present the results
of the assessment, including, if appropriate, a draft 
revision proposal, to the Consultation Forum no later 
than July 1st, 2023.
b) Medium power pole-mounted transformers  
25 up to 400 kVA4. Requirements for medium power transformers (three-phase, ≤ 3,150 kVA)3. New standards are needed to implement the review of the RegulationExisting standards:
 ¡EN 50588 was related to MPT ≤ 3150 kVA and ≤ 36 kV
 ¡EN 50629 was related to LPT > 3150 kVA and > 36 kVThe new standard EN50708 will be split in 3 mains parts 
and subparts:

6. How to implement Tier 2 on July 1st, 2021, T&D EU statements
¡ In normal situation (no concession), that means after
July 1st, 2021 Manufacturers and Importers will not have
the right to deliver Transformers TIER 1 but only Trans-
formers TIER 2 even if contract has been signed before.
¡ The blue guide on the implementation of the 2016 
European Union product regulation clarifies when TIER 2
transformers are to be manufactured and delivered. 
There are only 2 stages:¡ Placing on the market
- A product is placed on the market when it is made
available for the first time on the Union market.
- This phase is only for manufacturers or importers.
- In normal situation (no concession), that means after 
July 1st, 2021 Manufacturers and Importers will not
have the right to deliver Transformers TIER 1 but only 
Transformers TIER 2 even if contract has been signed 
before.
¡ Making available
- Products made available on the market must comply
with the applicable Union harmonisation legislation at 
the moment of placing on the market.
- This operation is only done by distributor to distribu-
tor or distributor to user.
- That means after July 1st, 2021 distributor can deliver 
to user or other distributor and put in service trans-
formers TIER 1 if these transformers has been placed 
on the market before July 1st, 2021

 Earnings Release Q1 FY 2021 | Siemens Energy
1
Munich, February 2, 2021 – Siemens Energy today announced its results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 that ended December 31, 2020.
Solid start into the new fiscal year
Christian Bruch, President and Chief Executive Officer of Siemens Energy AG, said „The first quarter proves that we are on the right path to reach 
our annual targets. The Siemens Energy team achieved a solid start into the new fiscal year even under difficult circumstances.”
•Orders were at €7.4bn, substantially below the high basis of comparison in the first quarter of the prior year, driven by a sharp decline at Siemens 
Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE).
•Revenue increased by 2.6% to €6.5bn, including negative currency translation effects. On a comparable basis (excluding currency translation 
and portfolio effects) revenue rose by nearly 8%.
•Book-to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) was below the strong prior-year quarter, but clearly above 1, leading to an order backlog of €79bn, 
nearly unchanged to past fiscal year-end.
•Adjusted EBITA was with €243m back in the positive range (Q1 FY 2020: negative €117m) as the prior-year quarter was impacted by substantial 
project-related effects, predominantly driven by SGRE. The recent quarter benefited from operational improvements driving lower costs however 
including positive temporary effects. Adjusted EBITA before special items increased to €366m with a margin of 5.6%. In the recent quarter, 
special items came in at negative €123m.
•Net income sharply improved to €99m after a loss in the prior-year quarter. Basic earnings per share (EPS) rose to €0.09.
•Management confirms the outlook for fiscal year 2021.Earnings Release

Free cash flow pre tax (388) 95 n/a•As expected, orders were substantially down on reported and com-
parable basis. Both segments posted a decline on a reported basis.
Order intake at SGRE was more than half below the strong prior-year
quarter due to a sharply lower volume from large orders. Gas and
Power (GP) was stable on prior-year quarter’s level on a comparable
basis.
•Revenue was moderately up on a reported basis. SGRE achieved a
significant increase while GP posted a moderate decline. Excluding
currency translation and portfolio effects, total revenue rose by
7.7%.
•Service revenue came in slightly below the prior-year quarter due to
a moderate decrease at GP.
•Book-to-bill ratio was 1.14. The order backlog was impacted by cur-
rency translation effects but came in at €79bn close to prior fiscal
year-end.
•Adjusted EBITA was positively impacted due to revenue growth and
operational improvements including lower costs year-over-year. Both
segments showed an increased profit with SGRE posting stronger im-
provements.
•Special items increased compared to prior-year quarter mainly due to
stand-alone costs (expenses associated with the setup of the stand-
alone company) and SGRE restructuring and integration costs.
•Adjusted EBITA margin before special items of Siemens Energy in-
creased by 6.8 percentage points.
•Net income sharply improved and was back in a positive range. The
corresponding basic EPS was €0.09.
•Free cash flow pre tax was negative, as expected. The improvements
at GP were more than offset by a strong decrease at SGRE.
•During the quarter, provisions for pensions and similar obligations
decreased from €1,057m as of September 30, 2020 to €1,026m as
of December 31, 2020.

Free cash flow pre tax 101 4 >200%•Orders in the GP segment showed a solid development and were
moderately down compared to prior-year quarter only due to head-
winds from currency translation. The order development was sup-
ported by a significantly higher volume from large orders including
an Industrial Applications project in Brazil and a Generation project
in Libya totaling more than half a billion euro combined. All three
businesses posted a reported order decrease with the strongest de-
cline at Transmission given a high basis of comparison in the prior-
year quarter. On a comparable basis, orders at GP increased by 0.3%.
•Revenue was moderately down year-over-year as a slight increase at
Generation could not offset decreases at the two other businesses. It
was impacted by negative currency translation effects of 5.5 percent-
age points, leading to a revenue growth on a comparable basis of
2.6%.
•Service revenue was moderately down year-over-year, however in-
creased slightly excluding negative currency translation effects.
•Book-to-bill ratio of GP was 1.20, resulting in an order backlog at
quarter-end of €49bn, slightly above prior fiscal year-end including
negative currency translation effects.
•Adjusted EBITA sharply increased benefiting from operational im-
provements resulting in lower costs however including positive tem-
porary effects. Such effects are resulting from hedging transactions
and lower discretionary spend as well as positive customer settle-
ments. These impacts resulted in increases of Adjusted EBITA across
all three businesses.
•The impacts from special items increased compared to prior-year
quarter, largely due to stand-alone costs.
•Adjusted EBITA before special items sharply increased to €267m.
•Free cash flow pre tax was above prior-year quarter’s level supported
by project-related cash inflows and ongoing focus on asset manage-
ment.

Free cash flow pre tax (360) 65 n/a•The order intake sharply declined in comparison to Q1 FY 2020 due
to very large orders in prior year, which included among others, large
orders for offshore wind farms including service in Taiwan, the U.K.
and the Netherlands.
•The significant revenue growth was driven by offshore and service
businesses. On a comparable basis, revenue increased by 18.9%.
•Adjusted EBITA was sharply higher compared to prior-year quarter,
which was impacted by substantial negative effects totaling approx-
imately €150m related to project delays in Northern Europe. Recent
quarter benefited from volume effects and the reversal of ordinary
provisions associated with a lower rate of product failure and lower
maintenance costs.
•Special items rose year-over-year due to increased restructuring and
integration costs.
•Thus, improvement of Adjusted EBITA before special items was even
stronger. Adjusted EBITA margin before special items climbed by 12.1
percentage points.
•Free cash flow pre tax was down year-over-year as the prior-year
quarter strongly benefited from customer advance payments due to
the high order intake.

5Outlook
We expect global macroeconomic development to remain subdued in fiscal year 2021, with risks particularly related to geopolitical and geoeco-
nomic uncertainties. Our markets tend to have a limited effect to economic cycles and our businesses, especially our service business, is character-
ized by a high level of resilience. Nevertheless, we observe with concern the resurgence of the global COVID-19 pandemic and increasing local lock-
down situations. In many countries our operations are deemed system critical and thus are exempted from measures imposed by authorities.
ForSiemens Energy  in fiscal year 2021, we expect nominal revenue growth rate to be in the range of 2% to 12%, an Adjusted EBITA margin be-
fore special items of 3% to 5%, a sharp increase in Net income and a sharp decrease of Free cash flow pre tax.
For our GP segment  in fiscal year 2021 we assume a return to revenue growth compared to the fiscal year 2020 and thus nominal revenue
growth to be in the range of 2% to 11% and an Adjusted EBITA margin before special items of 3.5% to 5.5%.
Our SGRE segment  is expected to achieve a nominal revenue growth rate of 8% to 18%, driven by the conversion from existing order backlog as
well as a stable development of the service and product business. Adjusted EBITA margin before special items is expected to be in a range of 3%
to 5% in fiscal year 2021.
This guidance assumes no further financial impact from COVID-19 during fiscal year 2021. We are hence monitoring the recent spike in new infec-
tions with concern and evaluate appropriate measures as it pertains to our guidance.
This outlook excludes charges related to legal and regulatory matters.

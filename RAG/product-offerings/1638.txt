 5Integrate all aspects of your power generation in one system
Siemens Energy is combining its unique portfolio of gas and steam turbines, electrolyzers, and heat 
pumps, and turning it into a unique optimized power plant solution with one operating system.
New Hydrogen Ready Turbine
Green power generation can be a valuable addi-
tion with a new 100% hydrogen-ready power 
plant in your decarb journey
Co-Firing Existing Turbines
Existing service units can be upgraded to 
operate with a hydrogen co-firing mix
Heat Recovery Option
Combining power with heat generation allows 
for excellent overall efficiency

decarbonization solution.
Make your plant H 2 ready now and save
H2 gas turbines can be upgraded to hydrogen at a later date, 
reducing future retrofit costs. 
Upgrade requirement
• Requirement to modify existing gas 
turbines and combined cycle power plants 
to burn hydrogen in the future
• Minimization of risk of having future 
“stranded investments” when deciding 
today on new GT/CCPP power plant 
construction projectsPotential future developments
• Hydrogen content in gas pipeline likely to 
increase in future due to electrolyzers 
gaining wider acceptance and discharging 
hydrogen into the gas grid
• Changes in legislation enforcing 
decarbonization of power sector leading 
to a requirement to co-burn increasing 
content of clean hydrogen

Hydrogen Decarbonization Calculator
Realize your potential cost savings through CO₂ reduction with 
our Hydrogen Decarbonization Calculator
 8The CO2 emission data is based on methane. CO2 emission intensity is stated per kWh electricity with exception for Combined Heat and Power, which is stated per kWh electricity and heat.
The CO2 costs are based on The World Bank’s Carbon Pricing Dashboard (data from 1st of April 2021) with the exception of UK ETS which is based on a trading price of £43,99 (19th May 2021) and USD/GBP 
exchange rate of 1,415. Carbon pricing projections for advanced economies (IEA SDS 2030, IEA SDS 2040) are based on IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenarios. Exchange rates comes from exchangerate.host.

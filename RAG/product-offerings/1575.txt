1 Order backlog is calculated by adding the orders of the current reporting period to the balance of the order backlog as of th e end of the prior reporting period and then subtracting the revenue 
recognized in the current reporting period. Furthermore, direct order value adjustments such as modifications or cancellation s of orders, currency translation and portfolio effects are taken into 
account 2 Based on Siemens Energy Financial Framework. Not reported by SGRE. SGRE reports EBIT margin pre PPA and I&R costs which is no t acomparable metric. Investors should not 
consider Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items, as defined by Siemens Energy, as SGRE’s own guidance nor base their inve stment decisions with regard 
to SGRE shares on such metric.Record backlog. Recent profitability under pressure in

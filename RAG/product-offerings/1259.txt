 Earnings Release  Q4 FY 202 4 
July 1 to September  30, 2024 
Munich, Germany , November  13, 2024  – Siemens Energy  today announced  its preliminary results for the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 202 4 that 
ended September  30, 202 4. 
Siemens Energy achieves all annual goals and sets new targets for 2028  
“In a pivotal fiscal year 2024, we achieved all our goals, driven by strong orders and project execution across all our busine sses. Our focus remains 
on profitable growth, supported by highly favorable market conditions. The new mid -term targets until fisca l year 2028 reflect our leading role in 
the energy transition ”, says Christian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy AG.  
Q4 Fiscal Year 2024  
• Siemens Energy's markets continued  to develop favorably . This was  reflected in strong order intake. In c ombin ation  with an excellent operati onal  
performance the quarterly figures  were strong at  both the top and the bottom line . 
• Orders of Siemens Energy came in at €15.0bn growing by 4 2.3% on a comparable basis (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) , 
which was mainly driven by large orders at Grid Technologies  and Gas Services . Transformation of Industry reached its  highest order  intake  in a 
quarter to date  and Siemens Gamesa booked  orders close to  prior -year quarter’s level . Book -to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) was 1 .54, 
leading to a n order backlog of €12 3bn at year -end once more  exceeding the previous high . 
• Revenue of € 9.7bn was up by 16.6% on a comparable basis largely  due to  Grid Technologies and Siemens Gamesa , where  the ongoing ramp -
up drove strong revenue growth in  the offshore business . 
• Siemens Energy’s Profit before Special items was negative  with  €83m (Q4  FY 2023: negative  €487m) due to the expected loss at Siemens 
Gamesa . All segments  improve d compared to the prior -year quarter . Special items decreased to negative € 32m (Q4  FY 2023: negative € 64m). 
Profit for Siemens Energy came in at negative  €115m (Q4  FY 2023: negative  €551m). 
• Accordingly, Siemens Energy incurred  a Net loss of €254m (Q4 FY 2023: Net loss €870m) in the quarter . Corresponding basic earnings per share 
(EPS) were negativ e at € 0.34 (Q4 FY 2023: negative  €1.04). 
• Free cash flow pre tax amounted to €932m (Q4 FY 2023: €1,108 m), which  was stronger than expected , below prior -year quarter’s level prim arily 
due to the decrease at Siemens Gamesa . All segments deliver ed positive cash flows . 
Fiscal Year 202 4 
• Gas Services, Grid Technologies and Transformation of Industry experienced strong order intake and an excellent performance due to  strong  
project execution and operational improvements throughout the fiscal year . Siemens Gamesa  made  clear  progress in line with expectations. 
Overall, Siemens Energy achieved or exceeded the  upgraded guidance  for all key performance indicators.  
• Driven by G rid Technologies and Gas Services , Siemens Energy’s orders exceeded the high level of the prior fiscal year by 0.9% on a comparable 
basis and reached  €50. 2bn. 
• Revenue of €3 4.5bn rose by 12.8% on a comparable basis driven by  growth in all segments.  
• Profit before Special items increased to positive  €345m (FY  2023: negative  €2,776 m) mainly driven by a sharp loss reduction at Siemens 
Gamesa , but also due to sharp profit improvements at Grid Technologies and Transformation of Industry . Special items amounted to positive  
€2,038m (FY  2023: negative € 184m) largely related to gains from disposals and accelerated portfolio transformation . Profit came in at positive  
€2,383m (FY  2023: negative € 2,960 m). 
• Net income was €1,335m (FY  2023: Net loss €4,588 m) and c orresponding EPS were positive  at €1.37 (FY 2023: negative € 5.47). 
• Free cash flow pre tax increased sharply to €1,859m (FY  2023: €784m) despite a higher negative cash flow  at Siemens Gamesa  which was more 
than offset by increases in all other segments. Contributions and i mprovements to Free cash flow pre tax were led by Grid Technologies reflecting 
higher profit as well as order momentum . 
Fiscal Year 202 5 and m id-term targets fiscal year  2028  
• In fiscal year 202 5, we expect comparable revenue growth in a range of 8 % to 10 % and a Profit margin before Special items between 3 % and 
5 % for Siemens Energy . Furthermore, we expect a Net income around  break -even (excluding assumed  positive Special items  subsequent to the 
demerger  of the energy business from  Siemens Limited, India)  and Free cash flow pre tax up to  €1bn.  
• Due to the success in the recent  fiscal year and the good prospects for the next and subsequent fiscal years – in terms of the market environment 
and our business plan – we clearly upgraded  the mid-term growth and profitability targets  for fiscal year 2028 . We now intend to achieve a 
compound annual revenue growth on a comparable  basis in a high single -digit to low double -digit percentage range until fiscal year 2028 (i.e., 
fiscal years 2025 to 2028). For the Profit  margin in fiscal year 2028, we strive to reach a range between 10 % to 12  %.

 • Orders were sharply above  prior -year’s level , almost entirely driven 
by the new units business , mainly due to large orders at  Grid Tech-
nologies  and Gas Services . 
• Book -to-bill ratio came in at 1.54. Order backlog once again ex-
ceeded the previous record level and rose to  €123bn. 
• Revenue grew  significantly with growth in the new units business 
exceeding the increase in service revenue.  
• Profit before Special items  and the corresponding margin sharply im-
proved . All segments had profit i mprovements,  with the highest con-
tribution from Siemens Gamesa’s loss reduction compared to prior -
year’s quarter. Siemens Energy ’s overall strong operational perfor-
mance  was held back by one-time effects in connection with  legacy 
projects , mainly at Gas Services  and T ransformation of Industry . 
• The decrease  of Free cash flow pre tax was primarily driven by Sie-
mens Gamesa . Grid Technologies was the largest contributor to Free 
cash flow pre tax, mainly due to its profit development  and advance 
payments related to order growth .

 • Sharp growth of orders year-over -year, driven by new units business , 
was due to customer demand in the U .S. and the Middle East includ-
ing a higher  volume from large orders . Service business with signifi-

• Book -to-bill ratio was 1.30. The o rder backlog  amounted to €45bn 
remaining on previous quarter’s level due to negative currency trans-
lation effects . Service order backlog increased clearly compared to 
prior fiscal year -end.  
• Revenue was slightly above  the prior -year  level . Clear g rowth in the  
service business could offset the decrease in the new unit s business  
due to timing effects . 
• Profit before Special items and corresponding margin grew s ignifi-
cantly  compared to  prior -year ’s quarter . An improved  operational 
performance , mainly in the service business,  was held back by neg-
ative project related one-time effect s. This  includ ed a charge  associ-
ated with a legal proceeding related to a legacy gas turbine project

many and the U .S. 
• Grid Technologies  reported a Book -to-bill ratio of 2 and the order 
backlog rose to €33bn. 
• Revenue grew substantially  on a broad basis . Solution  business’ rev-
enue nearly twice the level of the prior -year quarter . 
• With a sharply increased Profit before Special items Grid Technolo-
gies achieved the highest quarter ly profit of  the recent fiscal year. 
The c orresponding margin improved s ubstantiall y. Both  were driven 
by a continued  strong operational performance , higher  volume  and 
a higher margin of the processed order backlo g year-over -year.

contributing to the double -digit growth supported  by strong execu-
tion of the order backlog  both in service and the new units business . 
• Profit before Special items and the c orresponding margin grew 
sharply compared to prior -year’s quarter due to operational improve-
ments, an increased volume and higher margin quality  of the pro-

 • Orders were moderately  down compared to  prior -year quarter , as an 
increase in the offshore business did not offset dec lines  in the on-
shore and service areas . Offshore growth was driven by a single large 
order in the North Sea worth €2.9bn. Onshore orders continued to 
be impacted by a temporary interruption of  sales activities  for the 
4.X and 5.X turbines  which was ceased for 4.X turbines during Sep-
tember 2024 . 
• Book-to-bill ratio came in at 1.34. The  order backlog increased  to 
€38bn. 
• Revenue grew s ignificant ly, driven by the increase in the offshore 
business , reflecting progress in the manufacturing ramp -up. The im-
provement reflected  in part  a reduced basis of comparison due to the 
quality issues and other circumstances  in the prior -year quarter . 
• Profit before Special items was negative  but overall in line with ex-
pect ations . The losses  still reflect project margins burdened by 
higher planned costs due to the known quality issues as well as the 
increased product costs and ramp -up challenges in the offshore area , 
which also heavily burdened prior -year’s quarter .

6 Outlook  
For fiscal year 2025, we anticipate overall favorable conditions in Siemens Energy ’s relevant market  environment. Strong electricity consumption 
growth  and the requirements of the energy transition necessitate  investment in energy infrastruc ture supporting all businesses of Siemens Energy . 
Regarding Siemens Gamesa a clear way forward is defined, and we assume that we will successfully continue on the path to reach break -even in 
fiscal year 2026. In particular, we expect sales activities for the 5.X onshore turbine to be resumed during fiscal year 2025 . 
Therefore, we expect  for Siemens Energy  to achieve comparable revenue growth (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) in fiscal 
year 2025 in a range of 8 % to 1 0 % (actual figure FY 2024: 12. 8 %) and a  Profit margin before Special items between 3 % and 5 % (actual figure 
FY 2024: 1. 0 %). We expect Net income to be around break -even ex cluding assumed positive Special items subsequent to the demerger of the 
energy business from Siemens Limited, India  (actual figure FY 2024: Net income € 1,335 m) and Free cash flow pre tax up to €1bn  (actual figure FY 
2024: € 1,859 m). 
The outlook for Siemens Energy does not include charges related to legal and regulatory matters.  
Overall assumptions per business area  
• Gas Services  assumes  a comparable  revenue  growth  of 7 % to 9 % (actual figure FY 2024: 1. 4 %) and a Profit  margin  before  Special  items  of 
10 % to 12 % (actual figure FY 2024: 9. 5 %). 
• Grid Technologies  plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of 23 % to 25 % (actual figure FY 2024: 3 2.2 %) and a Profit margin before 
Special items between  10 % and 1 2 % (actual figure FY 2024: 10. 5 %). 
• Transformation of Industry  expect s a comparable  revenue  growth  of 11 % to 13 % (actual figure FY 2024: 1 6.3 %) and a Profit  margin  before  
Special  items  of 8 % to 10 % (actual figure FY 2024: 7. 4 %). 
• Siemens Gamesa  assumes a comparable revenue growth of negative 9 % to negative 5 % (actual figure FY 2024: positive 11.1  %) and a negative 
Profit before Special items of around  €1.3bn (actual figure FY 2024: negative €1,7 81m).

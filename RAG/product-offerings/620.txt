Subsea medium and high voltage electrical connector systems SpecTRON offers the most comprehensive range of technically advanced and reliable subsea power connectors on the market. With an enviable track record and an extensive range of HV power connectors SpecTRON can be used on a wide range of subsea applications in subsea oil and gas and renewable energy. SpecTRON 8 SpecTRON 8 is Siemens Energy’s solution for small multiphase pumping, electro-submersible pumps (ESPs), tidal/wave energy machines, and long step-out control systems.  It is a compact, three-phase connector solution which can be connected by remotely operating vehicles (ROVs) as well as application specific “Stab” plates.  The product range includes umbilical termination units, high pressure penetrators and a feed-through system for in-well single and dual ESP systems. The SpecTRON 8 dual penetrator solution has been specifically designed and developed for subsea ETH projects. The product consists of the following:- A Dual Penetrator - 3.8/6.6(7.6)kV, 120A, 300bar rated bi-directional Dual Penetrator assembly system utilising metallic sealing. The penetrator assembly is utilised to penetrate the annulus in PiP ETH systems. Cold Splice - 3.8/6.6(7.6)kV, 120A rated splice assembly utilised to terminate the inboard side of the Dual Penetrator assembly to the ETH cables. Hot Splice - 3.8/6.6(7.6)kV, 120A rated splice system used to splice the ETH cables along the length of the PiP. Utilises triple layer elastomeric moulding for electric field control and allows for quick and reliable splicing operations. SpecTRON 10 Siemens Energy's SpecTRON 10 connector system is designed to support the needs of modern subsea pumping and compression systems such as water injection, wet and dry gas compression, single phase pumping, and multiphase pumping.  SpecTRON 10 is a single-phase connector system which can be mated by ROV and “Stab” tooling.  Through continuous development, the SpecTRON 10 product family has provided innovative solutions for subsea pumping since 2000 as well as 10 kV DC applications in tidal renewable applications. SpecTRON 45 SpecTRON 45 is Siemens Energy's new high-voltage connector for subsea power distribution applications.  Through incorporating several innovative technologies, SpecTRON 45 provides high electrical integrity and a truly modular design. This offers flexibility in layout for a broad range of applications, including subsea power distribution, very long step outs and high current systems. The SpecTRON 45 is our first connector to feature our Common Module Interface (CMI) and Quick Connect technologies for simple, reliable site termination and improved project execution.

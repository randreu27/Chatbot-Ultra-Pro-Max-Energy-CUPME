Customer Benefit
100% H2for carbon-free power generation from stored green
renewable energy successfully demonstrated in Sept. 2023
Decarbonizing Smurfit Kappa PRF pulp and paper industrial site by
modernizing the combined heat and power plant
Thepartnership within the consortium leverages shared expertise ,
drives innovation andpioneers the application of technologies
previously limited to the mobility and laboratory sectors.
Customer Challenge/Driver
TheEU-funded HYFLEXPOWER project, involving a consortium of
Siemens Energy ,Engie Solutions , and Centrax, is demonstrating
the use of hydrogen , produced and stored from renewable
electricity , in combination with natural gas in combined heat and
power plants. The SGT-400 industrial gas turbine at this site has been
upgraded toconvert stored hydrogen into electricity and heat.
Portfolio Elements/Scope
Sylizer 200 electrolysis, hydrogen compression/storage and a
12 MW SGT-400 industrial gas turbine
For the first time, an existing commercial gas turbine has been
converted to run on 100% H2 mixtures inDLE modeThe world’s first integrated Power-to-H 2-to-
Power/Heat demonstration plantReference Smurfit Kappa site in Saillat-sur-Vienne | France, September 2023

challengesQuality 
issuesPrice 
level
Cost
increases
Terms and 
conditions
Rapid growth of offshore demand has posed operational challenges 
in ramping up production simultaneously in multiple locationsFast development cycles among wind turbine manufacturers 
in recent years affected quality levels of new platformsDespite the significant price improvements  we achieved in recent quarters, 
unsustainable competition among wind turbine manufacturers in recent years 
has resulted in market pricing below healthy levels
Previous inadequate market -standard terms and conditions forced wind 
turbine manufacturers to assume unbalanced risks  and impeded them from 
passing cost increases on to customersSignificant increase in wind turbine manufacturers’ direct cost base, mainly 
driven by raw materials and logistics, has deteriorated project profitability

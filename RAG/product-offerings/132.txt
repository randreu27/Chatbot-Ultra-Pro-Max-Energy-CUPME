They lift the temperature by absorbing thermal energy from an existing low-temperature heat source and releasing it to a warmer space. The use of a heat source (e.g., waste heat from industries or renewable heat from nature, like rivers or geothermal sources) enables heat pumps to generate much more heat with a certain amount of electricity, than a simple direct conversion of electric power to heat could do. As one of the leading manufacturers of industrial heat pumps, we offer technology that has been truly proven over decades, with 50 units delivered in the mid-1980s and more than 6 million cumulative operating hours. During the next years, heat generation will be electrified and decarbonized step by step, due to the gradual replacement of fossil-fired thermal power plants with renewable energies. Excess capacities of renewable energy can be converted into heat, paving the way to CO 2 -free heat generation. For modern district heating and cooling or industrial heating applications, our large-scale industrial heat pumps are the best and most efficient solution to convert electricity to heat. Industrial heat pump configuration for up to 150°C forwarding temp and 70 MWth Industrial heat pump configuration for up to 100°C forwarding temp and 45 MWth Learn more about transforming heat production Decarbonisation of District Heating & Industrial Heat - Brochure Sustainable district heating for Berlin, Germany A new high-temperature industrial heat pump for the cooling center at Potsdamer Platz Latest industrial heat pump order From Finspong in Sweden to Mannheim in Germany: MVV commissions its first innovative river heat pump in Mannheim Visit GKM website The new river heat pump from MVV supplies climate-friendly heat from Rhine water to around 3,500 households - One of the largest heat pumps of its kind in Europe.

Refrigerants Siemens Energy’s industrial heat pumps use modern, energy-efficient, safe and non-hazardous working fluids. The refrigerants have negligible environmental impact in all aspects: Non-toxic Non-corrosive Ultra-low global warming potential (GWP) No ozone depletion potential (ODP) As responsible manufacturers, we see refrigerants as a design element of a heat pumps system. We will use the optimum refrigerant for the specific solution. Potential Heat Sources Industrial Sources Natural Sources Contact us Fields of Application District heating and/or cooling Efficient use of energy in industries, e.g., food & beverage, chemical, petrochemical & pharmaceutical, pulp & paper Benefits of industrial heat pumps More efficient than direct conversion of electric power to heat Simultaneous production of heat and cold due to thermal action CO 2 -free and free of emissions, when power from renewable sources is used Low levelized life-cycle cost of heat: Long term economic solution with low CAPEX and OPEX Easy to integrate in existing processes and applications Proven, reliable technology: Regular heat pumps are commonly available and attached to households. Large industrial heat pumps are being up-scaled and continuously improved and optimised by us. Waste heat can be re-used and sold for other purposes, connecting different applications (enabling new business models) Dynamic operation: Short ramp rates Power grid stabilization: Peak shaving for excess power generation to balance supply and demand, surplus power from renewable sources can be converted into heat Media and More Decarbonizing heat: The hot topic we can't ignore Heat accounts for around half of global energy consumption, contributing 40% of CO2 emissions. On the way to carbon neutrality, we thus can no longer ignore the topic. In an excellent article Christian Hüttl and Norbert Wenn outline the tools to green heat - at home, in buildings and in industry. Read more Making the most of waste heat Before the end of 2022, at Potsdamer Platz in the German capital Berlin, a novel hightemperature industrial heat pump will start supplying the city’s district heating system with net-zero heat. This is a pioneering project on the way to decarbonizing heat. Read more German utility deploys river heat pump to decarbonize heating Siemens Energy is supplying a large-scale river heat pump to Mannheim-based utility MVV in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The heat pump will use Rhine water as a heat source and, according to Siemens Energy, will be one of the largest heat pumps in Germany.

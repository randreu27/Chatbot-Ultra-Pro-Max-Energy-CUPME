Dear shareholders,
thisissue ofourshareholder letter reaches youafewdays
after our fifth Annual General Meeting and roughly two
weeks after wereported ourfirst quarter results forfiscal
year 2025 onFebruary 12,2025 .Because ofourvery strong
cash flow inthefirst quarter, wehad released preliminary
results already onJanuary 27,2025 .
“Our strong first quarter reflects the market opportunities
arising from theincreasing demand forelectricity .The strong
cash flow was mainly driven bygrowth across allour
businesses, advance payments and timing effects .Our focus
lies still on profitable topline growth and technological
leadership”, said Christian Bruch .
Siemens Energy got offtoastrong start tothis new
fiscal year.Demand forourproducts remained favorable
andthestrong order trends continued .Orders amounted
to€13.7bn.Asexpected, thiswasbelow thehigh level ofthe
prior-year quarter, inwhich Grid Technologies and
Transformation ofIndustry had booked exceptionally high
orders .Our book -to-bill ratio (ratio oforder intake to
revenue) was 1.53and thequarter ended with arecord
order backlog of€131bn.Revenue of€8.9bnincreased
by18.4%onacomparable basis1.
Profit before Special items ofSiemens Energy more than
doubled year-over -year to€481m(Q1FY2024 :€208m)
again held back byresults ofSiemens Gamesa, buttoa
significantly lesser extent than intheprior-year quarter .
Special items amounted tonegative €18m(Q1FY2024 :
positive €1,670m,inconnection with disposals) .Siemens
Energy's Profit came inat€463m(Q1FY2024 :€1,878m).
Net income came inat€252m(Q1FY2024 :€1,582m).
Corresponding basic earnings per share were €0.23
(Q1FY2024 :€1.79).
Free cash flow pre taxwas materially stronger than
expected at positive €1,528m (Q1 FY2024 :
negative €283m)driven byproject advance payments and
timing effects ofcustomer payments .All segments
contributed totheimprovement .

Packager Guidelines 
Section 9: 3rd Party Supplier Guideline 
 
9-1.  Purge Flow Estimates 
 
Packing under very good conditions will leak appr oximately .1 of a standard cubic foot per minute 
(SCFM). Factors such as rod finish, alignment  and case condition will affect the leakage.  
 The nitrogen usage to the purge connection will be approximately one cubic foot per hour flow rate. This 
will vary as packing wear occurs. These case improvements have reduced emissions from 1000 PPM 
down to 10 PPM (without purge gas) and essentially 0 PPM with purge gas applied. 
 
Purge/buffer gas pressure is to be maintained higher than the vent / drain pressure by at least 15 PSI. 
 
 
TYPICAL FLOW RATE 
 
 SCFM (M
3/min) 
Past Normal Lube Packing Ring .1-.3 (0.002 – 0.008) 
With Non Lube or Light Gases .2-.6 (0.005 – 0.016) 
Vent Flow Alarm for System 
Check .2-.3 (0.005 – 0.008) 
Purge Gas Into Distance Piece .1-.3 (0.002 – 0.008) 
Purge Gas Into Vent .1-.3 (0.002 – 0.008) 
 
 
Below rates are listed in API Appendixes "G & I". 
 
Purge Gas Rate Initially - 10 SCFH/C ASE = .08 Cubic Decimeters / Sec. 
Set Meter Range = 5 to 50 SCFH = .04 to .4 Cubic Decimeters / Sec.

9-3.  Vertical Frame Thermal Growth 
 
The vertical thermal growth (foot to crankshaft) fo r all frames can be expected to be in the following 
ranges: 
 
MOS  .005” - .008” (0.13 – 0.20 mm) 
   
HOS  .005" - .008" (0.13 – 0.20 mm) 
 
HOSS   .007" - .010" (0.18 – 0.25 mm) 
   
 9-4.  Packing RTD Temperat ure Setting Recommendations 
 
The following temperature limits were established to  safeguard the operation of  separable compressor  
packings.  Packing case temperatur e should not exceed 300° F (149°C). 
 
Alarm Setting     20° F (11°C) Above Normal Packing Operating Temperature Shutdown Setting    30° F (16.7°C) Abov e Normal Packing Operating Temperature 
 
 
9-5.  Main Bearing Temperature Setting Recommendations 
 
The following temperature limits were established to  safeguard the operation of  separable compressor  
main bearings. 
 
Maximum Alarm Setting    210° F (99°C) Maximum Shutdown Setting   220° F (104°C) 
Main Bearing ΔT (Bearing to Bearing)  Not to Exceed 20°F (11°C) 
      (Compressor Fully Heat Soaked) 
 
NOTE:  It is recommended that the main bearing RTD alarm and shutdown be set at 20° F (11°C) or  
30° F (16.7°C) respectively above the averag e of all the main bearing temperatures.

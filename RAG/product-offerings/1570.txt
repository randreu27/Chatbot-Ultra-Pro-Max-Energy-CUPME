•Large rotating equipment: 
Review options to exit coal
•Focus on high -margin,
high -volume variants
(turbines and generators)•Aeroderivative Gas Turbine:
Streamlining offering1
•Compressors: 
Consolidate platforms, 
selective rationalization•Focus on leading line -up 
of SF6-free and grid -stability 
products paying off
•Global design rules pushing 
standardization, modularization
•Global design platforms to reduce

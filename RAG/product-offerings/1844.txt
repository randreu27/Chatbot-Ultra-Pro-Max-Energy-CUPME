are based on the current expectations and certain assumptions, of which many are beyond Siemens’ and 
Siemens Energy’s control. These are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of 
these risks or uncertainties materialize, should decisions, assessments or requirements of regulatory 
authorities deviate from our expectations, or should underlying expectations not occur or assumptions prove 
incorrect, actual results, performance or achievements of Siemens or Siemens Energy may (negatively or 
positively) vary materially from those described explicitly or implicitly in the relevant forward -looking

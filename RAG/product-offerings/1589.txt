consumption inindustrial processes .
Anew aspect willbethegreater transparency inourcorporate structure :starting infiscal year 2023 ,the
former Divisions willberepositioned asBusiness Areas, whose keyfinancial figures willbereported quarterly .
This willincrease transparency forthecapital market significantly .1Wind market based on BloombergNEF , 2H 2021 Global Wind Market Outlook; excl. China; gas turbine, transmission and industrial market based on 
internal market assessment | 2 Power generation applications in H1 FY22

Transformation ofIndustry focuses mainly onreducing energy consumption and CO2emissions in
industrial processes, willinclude fourbusiness operations :
1)Sustainable Energy Systems (including hydrogen, electrolyzers ,Power -to-X,photovoltaics) ;
2)Electrification, Automation, Digitalization (EAD, formerly under Industrial Applications) ;
3)Industrial Steam Turbines &Generators (IST, including industrial steam turbines upto250MW andtheir
servicing, aswellasindustrial generators) ;and
4)Compression (CP, turbo and reciprocating compressors and their servicing ;formerly apart ofIndustrial
Applications) .
Asasingle organizational unit, these business operations would have had revenue of€3.9bninfiscal year

The targets ofthenew business areas forfiscal year 2025 clearly support theoriginal Gas and Power
margin target of≥8%(asreported) :
1With the Q2 earnings release (May 11, 2022), Siemens Energy maintained the guidance range for the GP segment in fiscal year 2 022. However, in light or 
prevailing challenges Siemens Energy expects results in GP towards the low end of the range.

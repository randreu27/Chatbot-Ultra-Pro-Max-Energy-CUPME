The following is intended to provide you with information on processing of your personal data by Siemens Energy AG and your rights under data protection law. You can obtain more information on data protection in our Privacy Notice . Who is responsible for data processing? The responsible entity is Siemens Energy AG, Otto-Hahn-Ring 6, 81739 Munich, Germany.

If you have any questions on data protection in the share register, we therefore ask you to contact hv-service.siemens-energy@adeus.de or the hotline at +49 89 207084040. For what purposes and on what legal basis is your data processed? From whom do we obtain your data? When maintaining the share register, we process your data – as we receive it from you, the custodian bank or the central securities depository Clearstream Banking AG, Eschborn, Germany – on the basis of the requirements under stock corporation and capital market law as well as regulatory specifications. Section 67 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) stipulates that registered shares must be entered in the company’s share register along with the name, date of birth and postal as well as e-mail address of the shareholder and the number of shares. In order to clarify any potential ambiguities, the bank submitting the information will also be recorded. We use your personal data for the purposes provided for in the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). These purposes include, in particular, maintaining the share register, communicating with you as a shareholder, and staging Shareholders’ Meetings. In the case of structural or capital measures, we must refrain from providing certain shareholders with information on offers owing to their nationality or place of residence, in order to comply with securities legislation in individual countries. In connection with the Shareholders’ Meeting, we process your personal data (register data of the shareholder, the name, address and e-mail address of his/her representative, if applicable, the type of ownership of the shares, absentee votes/voting instructions, and the number of the admission ticket, if applicable) on the basis of prevailing data protection legislation in order to enable you as a shareholder to exercise your rights at the Shareholders’ Meeting. Processing of your personal data is mandatory under stock corporation law (Section 123 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in conjunction with Section 14 of the Articles of Association of Siemens Energy AG; Section 129 (1) sentence 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG); Section 1 (1, 2) of the Act on Measures in Corporate Law, Cooperatives Law, Associations Law, Trust Law, and Real Estate Owner Law to Combat the Effects of the COVID-19-Pandemic) so that you can attend the Shareholders’ Meeting and/or cast votes. To which categories of recipients do we pass on your data? We use external service providers and their subcontractors, in each case in the EU, for administration and technical maintenance of the share register (share register service company) and to stage the Shareholders’ Meeting (shareholders’ meeting service provider). Upon the publication of counterproposals and election nominations we disclose the name and address of the respective shareholder. In connection with the Shareholders' Meeting, shareholders and their proxy representatives may view the list of attendance. How long do we store your data? As a matter of principle, we render your personal data anonymous and delete it as soon as it is no longer deemed necessary for the above-mentioned purposes, insofar as statutory documentation and storage obligations (for example in the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), German Commercial Code (HGB), German Fiscal Code (AO)) are not applicable. What are your rights as a data subject? At the address stated above, you can obtain information on and access to the data about you that we have stored. If certain requirements are met, you also have the right to demand that your data be rectified or erased or that processing of it be restricted (for instance, if your data is processed unlawfully).

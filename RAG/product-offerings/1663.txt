TMTTV  – Gimpel Top Mechanism Trip T hrottle Valve  
Background  
SE Gimpel top mechanism latch -type trip 
throttle valve (TMTTV) is suited for single -
valve, single -stage and single -valve, multi -
stage steam turbines that drive chillers, fans, 
generators and pumps in air conditioning 
service, correctional facilities,  food pro-
cessing plants, hospitals, pulp and paper 
plants, chemical and petrochemical plants, 
refineries and universities.  
The primary function of the Gimpel TMTTV  is 
to function as an emergency closing  safety 
valve that trips at oil pressure loss.  It can also 
be used to slow -roll the steam turbine during 
start -up. 
 
Design  
The valve is designed so that once tripped it 
cannot be opened unless safe oil pressure 
exists in the oil system. It is normally in-
stalled wit h the hand -wheel in a vertical or 
horizontal position.  
The valve can be furnished in several body 
styles and assembly arrangements.  Features  
The design incorporates more than 50 years 
of reliable operation and experience with 
proven technology, including:  
Standard features  
• ANSI  normal p ipe sizes  (NPS) 2 to 10 and 
pressure classes  150 to 900  
• Steam temperature up to 950 °F (510°C ) 
• Tripping in 0.5 seconds  
• Poppet design with pilot valve capable 
of opening against f ull differential 
steam pressure  
• Cast alloy steel valve body with bolted 
yoke ( cover ) available in straight -
through, corner -body and tip -inlet flow 
arran gements  
• Nitralloy -nitrided valve stem/ pilot valve 
and steam bushings  
• Chrome mo ly steel main disc and valve 
seat (seating contact sur faces are over-
laid with Stellite ® wear -resistant metal 
alloys* ) 
• Stainless ste el, integral , replaceable , 
steam s trainer basket  
• Handwheel ( prov ides throttling for use 
during start -up)

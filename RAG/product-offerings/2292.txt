Paragraph      Comments 
 
3.7  Siemens Energy defines MAWP as the maximum continuous gauge pressure for which the 
manufacturer nameplates it's compressors (o r relevant part thereof) when handling the 
specified fluid at the specified temperature.  It is also the maximum relief valve setting. 
 
3.10  Siemens Energy defines RDP (rated discharge pressure) as being MAWP/1.10 or MAWP - 25 
PSIG (1.8 kg/cm2) whichever is greater. I.E., a cylinder would have an RDP of 1000 PSIG (70.3 
kg/cm2) and a MAWP of 1100 PSIG (77.3 kg/cm2) - or a cylinder with a MAWP of 100 PSIG (7.0 
kg/cm2) would have an RDP of 75 PSIG (5.3 kg/cm2). The MAWP is the controlling rating.  
 
3.11  Siemens Energy Sizing performance program calculates "Rated Power" by assuming some 
general pressure drops for each of these factors. Each Reseller designs their own pulsation 
suppression devices, orifices, process piping, in tercoolers and separators. Siemens Energy will 
not be responsible for errors granted via outside suppliers equipment. 
 
3.13   Capacity can be expressed with no negative tolerance if so specified. 
 3.15  Volume flow referred to 0.1013 Mpa (1.013 bar A) and a temperature of 0° C (32° F) if so 
specified. 
 6.3  Discharge temperatures can be limited to 135°  C (275° F) if so spec ified. Siemens Energy 
sizing program flags T (adiabatic) @300° F (149° C) and T (estimated actual) at the cylinder 
design limit of 350° F (177° C). Both temperatures are shown on standard output form. 
 
6.4.1.2  Siemens Energy calculates gas rod load at  the compressor flange at 0 and 180 degrees. Gas 
rod load can be calculated at relief valve set pressure, if specified. 
 
6.5.1.1  Siemens Energy compressor cylinder "maxim um allowable working pressure" (MAWP) exceeds 
the "rated discharge pressure" (RDP) by 10% or as a minimum 25 PSI (1.8 kg/cm
2). 
 
6.5.2.1  Siemens Energy recommends outboard cy linder supports on all cylinders, 15" (381.0 mm) 
diameter or larger and all  cylinders with HOVVCP. 
 
6.5.2.3.3  Siemens limitation is -51° C (-60° F) before  special stud material is required. For temperatures 
of -20° C (4° F) but warmer than -51° C (-60° F) , Siemens Energy can supply special material at 
an extra price. Note that stainless steel metallic  valve plates are required on PF valves for 
temperatures colder than -29° C (-20° F). 
 
6.5.3.1  Siemens Energy 26.0" (660.4 mm), 26. 5” (673.1 mm) and 28.0" (711.2 mm) HOS/HOSS 
cylinders have a machined rectangular studded flange. Forged steel billet cylinders to 4400 PSI (309.4 kg/cm
2) MAWP typically use "ring joint" flanges . Forged steel billet cylinders from 4400 
psi (309.4 kg/cm2) to 6600 PSI (464.0 kg/cm2) MAWP use "lens" style connections. 
 6.6.2.1  Siemens Energy Model PF valves ar e not 100% polarized. Should a discharge valve 
inadvertently be installed in a suction valve hol e; the valve will not completely seat so no 
damage can occur. 
 
6.7.1 Siemens Energy standard does not include provision to positively lock piston rods into 
crossheads.

6.7.3.  Siemens Energy standard complies with the requirement 
that combo piston rings or wear bands do not ov er-travel the valve ports or counter-bores by 
over 1/2 the axial width of the combo piston ring or wear band. 
 
6.7.4.  Siemens Energy Model MOS/HOS/HOSS/BO S compressors comply. Siemens Energy Model 
MOS compressors are not hardened to meet the 50Rc hardness requirement in the packing 
travel area. If specified, this can be provided at an extra price. 
 
6.9.3  Siemens Energy distance piece come standar d with a 3/4" (19.1 mm) NPT vent connection. If 
so specified, a larger connection can be furnished at an extra price. 
 
6.10.2  Siemens Energy has a few MOS, HOS and HOSS applications where the packing cases are 
rated slightly less than the MAWP of the cylinde r, however field experience has proven these to 
be reliable. 
 
6.11.2  Siemens Energy standard oil level gauge is a "Bulls Eye" type with a single line only. The 
Instruction Book defines how to determine minimum and maximum levels with this gauge. 
 
6.11.3.1  All Siemens Energy current pr oduction line compressor models comply.  
 6.11.3.2  Siemens Energy recommends the use of an electric motor driven pre-lube pump on all electric 
motor driven compressors. These are normally supplied by the Reseller, but Siemens Energy 
can supply at an extra price if specified. 
 
6.11.6  Siemens Energy supplies a machined connection point for a crankcase oil-level control device. 
Oil level control device and oil storage tank are normally supplied by the Reseller but can be supplied by Siemens Energy at an extra price if specified. 
 
6.11.7  Siemens Energy’s long time supplier of lubricator heaters exceeds the 2 W/cm^2 maximum 
heat flux specified. 
 
6.12.1  Siemens Energy standard is to supply 300 Se ries stainless steel tubing and fittings for all 
cylinder lubrication tubing lines. 
 6.12.2  Siemens Energy’s standard cy linder lubrication system uses oil supplied from the crankcase to 
the lubricator pumps and then to the distribution block system. This system can be modified to 
one supplied from a separate oil tank if specified. 
 
6.13.1.3  Siemens Energy has had many years of sati sfactory experience with both cast iron and nodular 
iron cylinders that exceed these ratings. (For example, 10.5" (266.7 mm)  CI cylinders to 1500 
PSIG (105.5 kg/cm
2), 6.0 (152.4 mm) - 7.0" (177.8 mm)  NI cylinders to 2750 PSIG (193.3 
kg/cm2), 8.5 (215.9 mm) -9.0 (228.6 mm) - 9.5"  (241.3 mm) cylinders to 1925 PSIG (135.3 
kg/cm2), etc.) 
 
6.13.3.3  When used, drilled plugs for plug repair ar e subject to a liquid dye penetrant examination and 
tested via hydrotest after repair is complete. 
 
7.4.1  Siemens Energy Sizing Performa nce Program uses a "warning flag" for discharge volumetric 
efficiencies lower than  10% rather than a suction volumetric efficiency limit. 
 
 
 
7.4.2  Siemens Energy does not vent the outboard side of hand operat ed variable volume clearance 
pockets as standard. This can be done at an extra price if specified.

9.3.3  Siemens Energy offers the Model HOSS co mpressor using a 2.875" (73.0 mm) piston rod 
standard design packing cases. Water cooled packing cases can be supplied for high pressure applications or for special gases when specified. 
 
17.3.4.1  Siemens Energy can perform a pressure test  with helium (in addition to the hydrotest) for gases 
with a MW of 12 or less or with 0.001 mole fracti on of H2S when specified at an extra price. 
 
20.2  Hydrogen Sulfide: Siemens Energy has years of satisfactory experience supplying compressors

in the Application and Data Book or is ava ilable on request. Standard nodular iron cylinder 
material is ASTM A536. Special materials are available upon request. 
 
20.3  Carbon Dioxide: Siemens Ener gy has years of satisfactory ex perience supplying compressor for 
CO2 service. General Guidelines are included in GFP16 Carbon Dioxide Service which is 
included in the Application and Data Book or is available upon request. 
 21.8  Siemens Energy’s standard primer is Sher win Williams Red Oxide "Kem-Flash" 500 primer. Top 
coats supplied by the Reseller need to be compatible with this primer.

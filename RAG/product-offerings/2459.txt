A study on the electrification of the European Ferry Fleet
Study in cooperation with
Electrification of the European 
Ferry Fleet
1. Executive summary
With small and large ferries playing an important role in 
European transport, electrification of such traffic is 
becoming an effective and readily available solution for 
reducing carbon emissions. 
And the great news is that European ferries can go electric 
today. But what does this mean and what are the benefits 
of this change? In short, electrification is a proven solution, 
not just in cutting emissions drastically but in improving air 
quality in ports, with standardised, cost-effective and 
commercially available technology. With electrification and 
hybridisation, ferries can now become part of our 
zero-emission transport system. With solutions for engine 
hybridisation and connection to shore power in port being 
something that can be implemented both quickly and 
efficiently too. 
In fact, the first fully electric ferry, “Ampere” entered opera -
tion in Norway in 2015, becoming evidence that the solu -
tion was feasible in a technical, economical and operational 
sense. In the same year, Bellona and Siemens Energy 
published a study showing that electrification of 7 out of 10 
ferries would be economically viable. And it’s since 2015, 
our findings have been validated with 70 electric ferries 
entering operation in Norway, driven by economic consid -
erations and strong requirements in public procurement. 
Investing in technology  
The following report, made in a cooperation between 
Siemens Energy and Bellona, estimates that nearly 50% of 
ferry emissions can be cut by investments in such standard 
technology. These emissions typically happening in port 
and within the first hour of travel. The other half of the 
emissions, linked to longer voyages, can be tackled by 
substitution with low and zero emission fuels such as 
hydrogen, ammonia, biofuels or carbon capture.  
Ferry operations in Europe are concentrated in a number of 
key locations. The four countries analysed including 
Germany, Greece, Italy and the UK – all having extensive 
ferry activity and accounting for 35% of European ferry 
emissions. And the largest ferry country in Europe, Norway 
is adding another 17%, although they are already well on 
the path to electrification with more than 70 zero emission 
ferries currently in operation or under construction.
Measurement of shore power  
The report also highlights the role of shore power as the 
single most important measure to implement. In general, 
vessels need to run engines in port, to keep necessary 
systems going. In Germany and the UK, emissions in port 
add up to 20% of total emissions from the sector, while in 
Greece the share is a staggering 37%. The average emis -sions in port for the four countries combined being 26%, 
equal to 440,000 tons of CO₂ . 
To fully exploit the electrification potential, full-electric 
vessels should be incentivised to replace older vessels on all 
routes up to one-hour in length. Such vessels will likely 
need to be dedicated to specific routes than current fleet 
operations dictate and retrofitted with a range of hybrid 
systems. Thus facilitating electric operation in the first hour 
of travel.
The ferry fleet in Europe is on average 35 years old, with 
65% of the vessels more than 20 years old. Meaning that 
during this decade, more than half of the fleet will be 
subject to replacement. 
When replacing vessels with new builds, better hull and 
propeller design and lighter materials, e.g. aluminium will 
make them far more energy efficient. Thus reducing the 
need for power to perform the same level of transport 
work. And during this decade, hydrogen and ammonia will 
be available as fuel alternatives for the shipping sector 
replacing fossil fuels like diesel and LNG.
Ferry fleets also perform a range of public services with 
local and national governments responsible for these 
services and the issuing of tenders for the various routes. 
That gives those governments the opportunity to set the 
conditions for operational ferry connections in line with 
climate goals and to invite operators to offer climate smart 
technology solutions. The political system is therefore 
providing opportunities to kick-start the electrification of 
the shipping industry. Stimulating the shipyards and 
suppliers to develop solutions and the right competencies 
needed to achieve the climate goals for all types of vessels, 
faster.
2. Key countries in the electrification 
of European ferries
This study also looks at the potential for electrification in 
some of Europe’s most ferry-intensive countries. The coun -
tries represent major differences in geography, route grids 
and population demography, but are united in their reliance 
on ferries as an important mode of transportation.Average age of European ferry fleet 35 years
Share of fleet older than 20 years 64,59 %
Share of fleet older than 30 years 44,70 %
Share of fleet older than 40 years 25,46 %

Italy  
Ferries provide an important transport alternative in Italy. 
With a coastline of 7600 km and several large and small 
islands require connections to the mainland making the 
Italian ferry fleet the second largest in Europe, behind 
Norway. 
Italian ferries travel between the mainland and the islands 
of Sicily and Sardinia, as well as neighbouring countries 
of France (Corsica), Albania and Greece. There are also 
many routes to smaller islands all along the coast. The 
highest frequency crossing is the Sicily ferry (Villa San 
Giovanni-Messina), while the most emission intensive 
crossings are between mainland Italy to Sardinia (Civitavec -
chia-Cagliari) and mainland Italy to Sicily (Naples-Palermo).
The Italian ferry fleet consists of 107 vessels, with 94 
flagged in Italy. Most of their fleet are more than 25 years 
old consisting of mainly smaller ferries (<150m). Although 
there are only 15 larger ferries, they account for 43% of fer -
ry-related emissions under voyage. Whereas smaller ferries 
emit 29% of emissions under voyage, with the remaining 
28% occurring in port. Total ferry-related emissions in Italy 
are 697 000 tons CO₂ .
Greece  
Seafaring is a vital part of the history of Greece. Its geogra -
phy, a large peninsula and thousands of islands throughout 
the Aegean and Ionian Sea, requires transport of people and 
cargo. This includes local residents and in recent decades a 
large number of tourists.
The Greek ferry fleet consists of 98 vessels, with 88 flagged 
and most of which forming smaller ferries (<150m). These 
vessels mainly traffic routes to Greek islands and close 
neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Albania, and Italy. 
The highest frequency crossing is the short route between 
Piraeus and Paloukia, while the most emissions intensive 
crossing is from Aegina to Piraeus (mainland) and Rafina Port 
(Pikermio, mainland) to Tinos (island in Aegean Sea).
Ferry traffic itself accounts for only about 2/3 of emissions. 
In Greece, ferries spend more time in port and correspond -
ingly a larger part of emissions are produced there - calculat -
ed to about 37%. The main port of Piraeus handles the bulk 
of port calls and represents around 1/3 of all port emissions. 
Total ferry-related emissions in Greece are 310 000 tons CO₂ .
Germany  
German ferry traffic is mainly focused on the Baltic Sea and 
to its neighbouring countries of Denmark and Sweden. While 
there is major maritime activity along the larger German 
rivers, these vessels often fall into other categories than 
passenger ferries. The Elbe crossing between Wischhafen 
and Glückstadt is, however, the highest frequency route, 
while the Denmark ferry (Puttgarden-Rødby) and the Swe -
den ferries (Travemünde-Trelleborg, Rostock-Trelleborg) are 
the most emissions intensive. The ferries that operate the 
Puttgarden-Rødby connection today have hybrid-electric propulsion that reduce emissions for this route. There are 
now plans for fully electric ferries to operate this route and 
what will soon become the world longest course operated by 
a full electric ferry. This measure alone having the potential 
to reduce the total German ferry emissions by 13%.
Consisting of mostly smaller ferries (<150m), the German 
fleet has 105 vessels, with 77 flagged in the country. Al -
though there are only 15 larger ferries, they account for 60% 
of ferry-related emissions. These vessels operate the routes 
mentioned above, to Sweden, Denmark, and Poland. Smaller 
ferries emit 20% of emissions under voyage, while another 
20% occur in port. Total ferry-related emissions in Germany 
are 309,000 tons CO₂ .
United Kingdom  
Connections over the English Channel to Ireland, Isle of 
Man, the Inner and Outer Hebrides and a further 6 000 
smaller islands are connected mainly by sea through his -
tory. Although air travel and the Eurotunnel have reduced 
the need for ferries, they still play a key role, especially in 
Scotland and the islands in the west and north.
The British ferry fleet consists of 88 ferries, with 72 flagged 
in the UK. Most vessels are less than 150m, with only five 
in the region of 150-220m long. The fleet is also relatively 
new, with more than half of all vessels (56%) built over the 
last 25 years. The highest frequency crossing is the connec -
tion between Cumbrae Slip and Largs (mainland), while the 
most emission intensive crossing is the ferry from Newcas -
tle to IJmuiden, Netherlands.
Although there are only five ferries between 150 and 220 
meters, they account for a quarter of ferry-related emis -
sions. Smaller vessels make up 55% of the emissions, while 
20% of UK ferry-related emissions happen in port. Total 
ferry-related emissions in UK are 359,800 tons CO₂ .

3. Electrification can reduce ferry 
emissions by 800 000 tons CO₂
Analysis shows that electrification of ferries in Italy, Greece, 
Germany and the UK can reduce emissions by as much as 
800,000 tons of CO₂ , when relying on available technology: 
shore power, hybridisation, and electric for routes of up to 
one hour. This reduction corresponding to a 50% decrease 
in ferry-related emissions in these countries. 
 ➞ Emissions in port are a relatively large part of total 
emissions. From 20% to 37% in the countries shore 
power build-out to reduce port emissions would make 
a big change in the overall picture. With the 10 most 
emissions-heavy ports in each of the four countries 
accounting for a total of 444,278 tons of CO₂  or 64% of 
the port emissions.
 ➞ Full electrification is possible for a range of routes 
today. These routes account for 155,000 tons of CO₂ , 
12.6% of emissions under transport and are in the 
analysis routes with transit duration of 60 minutes or 
less operated by ferries of up to 150m in length. 
 ➞ Hybrid electrification is the current main option for 
longer routes. Operated by both small and larger 
vessels with a duration of more than 60 minutes, the 
emission reduction potential from these routes is 
mainly linked to the first hour of potential battery 
operations, representing 227.400 tons of CO₂ , 13.,6% 
of all emissions under transport.
 ➞ Combining shore power build-out, full electrification of 
shorter routes, and hybridisation of all routes, the 
potential for emission reduction is estimated at 
800,000 tons of CO₂  for the four countries analysed.  Although the four countries in the analysis are very 
different – geography, types and usage of ferries, and 
staying time in port, the conclusions are in fact quite 
similar. There are also further considerations that hold 
across these different countries.
 ➞ AIS data shows that ferries operating short routes in 
many cases are used on other and longer routes as 
well. With current operations it will be necessary to 
consider hybrid electrification, rather than full electrifi -
cation. In these cases, batteries provide energy for the 
first hour, complemented by a diesel-electric engine. 
With the current route grid and disposition of vessels, 
hybrid electrification combines the ability for reducing 
emissions and managing longer routes. 
 ➞ To enable fully electric operations, there is a need for 
increased specialisation of vessels, dedicating certain 
ones to particular types of routes. This will require a 
shift in thinking regarding fleet management, with 
new conditions imposed. Added to this, there is also a 
clear expectation that battery energy density and price 
will enable extended range for fully electric ferries 
beyond 60 minutes. 
 ➞ Hybrid electrification does not automatically cause 
fossil fuel lock-in. For longer routes hybridisation will 
likely be both necessary and efficient with zero-emis -
sion fuels, providing steady operations for fuel cells, 
peak shaving or other applications. Direct electrifica -
tion is also efficient energy use, complementing the 
use of hydrogen, ammonia, or other low/zero emission 
fuels.
 ➞ New builds with use of lightweight material, improved 
propeller and hull design are more energy efficient and 
will extend the range significantly.

Batteries are energy efficient  
For an internal combustion engine, you will 
have several energy losses such as heat 
which will typically range from40 to 60%. 
For a battery, you will have losses during 
charging and discharging that are signifi -
cantly lower than an internal combustion 
engine. This varies based on many factors 
like air temperature, charging intensity and 
type of battery. For a battery as an energy 
source, you may experience somewhere 
between 80-95% efficiency, disregarding 
the necessary heating needs.
Developers of batteries, especially to cars 
and maritime applications are searching for 
new and better solutions, e.g., new types of 
cells that will provide improvement like 
energy density, charging characteristics and 
better fire safety etc. Research and develop -
ment take time but with a growing market, 
more resources are being allocated to 
making more solutions and continuing to 
improve battery quality overall. There are several battery factories under 
construction or planning in Europe, which 
reflect the growing annual sales of batteries 
and the transformation to electric propul -
sion in vehicles and vessels. By 2030 the 
market for batteries and propulsion systems 
will be completely different than today. 
For charging in port, how fast connections 
can be made will be crucial. For ferries with 
a short stay in port, automated connection 
systems will facilitate this fast connection. 
For charging, the CP (constant power) 
shows just how intensive charging can be 
done. One CP means that a battery size of 
one MWh can charge with one MW capacity 
with batteries available in the range of 0,6-3 
CP. However, a connection with more time 
in port, means the need for automated 
connection with high charging power being 
lower. 
Overall, the total demand for energy can 
range from 80 to 1500 kWh depending on 
the size of the ferry, length of route and 
speed.VesselVessel AmpereAmpere Color HybridColor Hybrid11ElektraElektra Bastø ElectricBastø Electric

4. The Political Landscape  
for Electrification 
Tools and National strategies
Freedom to provide services for maritime transportation is 
applied in accordance with the Council Regulation (EEC) n. 
3577, 7 December 1992. States can conclude public service 
contracts as a condition for the provision of cabotage service 
to ensure the adequacy of regular transport services to, from 
and between islands. Public service contracts provide a clear 
opportunity to impose requirements for emissions reductions 
in ferry services. This has been one of the key success factors 
for electrification of ferry transport in Norway.
In July 2021, the European Commission proposed a legislative 
initiative called “FuelEU Maritime”2. This proposal requires that 
ships (over 5 000 GT) reduce the GHG intensity of the energy 
used onboard. This requirement increases over time to secure 
the track to full decarbonization by 2050. This is one of several 
proposals in the Fit-for-55 package to help national and local 
politicians to achieve zero-emission ferries3. 
Italy  
The Italian Ministry of Sustainable Infrastructure and 
Mobility has recently published a ten-year plan for enhancing 
mobility services in Italy in line with the new global goals for 
sustainable development, including climate stability. The 
Ministry plans to carry out a renewal of trains, buses and 
ships by low- emissions technologies as well as to increase 
investments for the development of ports, logistics and mari -
time transport. 8.4 billion EUR will be allocated to ‘green’ local transport and 
rapid mass transport. This includes the purchase of new ‘eco’ 
ships, e.g. for a faster and more sustainable connection over 
the Strait of Messina to Sicily. More than 3.8 billion EUR will 
be spent on a transition of the naval fleet, for ship retrofit -
ting and electrification of port operations in order to reduce 
emissions and pollution in port cities. And 0.7 billion EUR will 
be allocated to a renewal of the Mediterranean fleet with 
low environmental impact ships. 
The Ministry is currently launching calls for tenders for public 
service contracts. Invitalia is the national agency responsible 
for conducting the tenders4, with Italian investment bank CDP 
providing financial support to public and private stakeholders.
Greece  
The Greek National Recovery and Resilience Plan5 shows that 
there are proposals for upgrading and renewing ports and 
passenger shipping fleets, with 47 ferry routes and 44 island 
port infrastructure projects in development. There are how -
ever no specific targets for emissions reductions in the plan.

There is also a program for support to ferry lines with unsat -
isfactory economies. This is provided through the national 
budget, totaling slightly more than 90 million EUR in 2019, up 
from 80 million EUR in 2014. This provision doesn’t, however 
follow the increasing number of ferry passengers, rising from 
14 million passengers in 2012 to 19 million in 20196. 13 % of 
the Greek population are islanders, half of them residing on 
the island of Crete.
Climate change and emissions reductions is however an 
important consideration in a recent agreement between 
Greece and the EU Commission. The agreement on a National 
Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) for 2021-2027 encom -
passes fisheries, aquaculture and the maritime sector. The 
total program for the six-year period totals 21 billion EUR and 
includes plans for improving ferry transport and island port in -
frastructure for 1 billion EUR, sourced from national funds and 
the European Strategic Partnership Agreement Fund (ESPA). 
With the program expected to facilitate large-scale emissions 
reductions from Greek maritime transport.
Germany  
Waterways in Germany are divided between coastal areas and 
Bundeswasserstraßen (federal waterways) under the political 
and bureaucratic management of the Federal government, 
Landeswasserstraßen and the regulation of the respective 
German Land. The waterways, canals and rivers are a crucial 
part of the transportation system and there are several initia -tives for low- and zero-emission vessel projects. 
The Federal and respective Länder (regional) Ministries of 
Transport are the most important government agencies in 
shipping and public transport cases. The Federal Ministry of 
Economy and Climate Protection and the Federal Ministry of 
the Environment playing an important role in providing fund -
ing and support for projects of this kind. However, whether 
the restructuring of climate action governance on the Federal 
level will affect different funding mechanisms remains to be 
seen. The German Agency for the Management of Waterways 
and Shipping (WSV) plays a key role to assess, initiate and 
support zero emission projects for public transport. 
The ferry connection to Denmark (Rødby - Puttgarden) has 
already operated with hybrid-electric propulsion for some 
years already and is now planning for full electric vessels. This 
will be, up to now, the longest zero-emission ferry connection 
in the world7. Similar potential exists also with shorter coastal 
ferries to the East-Frisian Isles in the North Sea. 
The coastal Länder have focused on shore power for contain -
er, cruise and ferry activity in ports. Both the federal gov -
ernment and the Länder administration use both economic 
and legal measures to accelerate the transformation to zero 
emission8 in port. German commitment to reducing emissions 
and stimulating technology development is strong. Combined 
with high shipping activity in coastal areas and along inland 
waterways, Germany is well positioned for a transformation of 
all shipping related emissions.

Benefits of electrification  
Electrification greatly improves energy efficiency, eliminates 
funnel emissions of CO₂ , sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides 
and particulate matter. It also vastly reduces noise and vi-
brations compared to internal combustion engines. Auxiliary 
engines to power electronics are also no longer needed as 
this energy is already provided by the batteries on board.
Zero emission ferries thus benefit both climate and local air 
quality. Especially worth noting is the absence of idling with 
electric propulsion. Because it’s by emissions from idling en-
gines in port, a major source of local air pollution, that will 
yield significant health benefits to the local population.
In addition, experience with electric drivetrains and other applications have shown that maintenance costs generally 
are lower, with service intervals and the expected service 
life of motors and components both becoming longer. 
The technology needed to electrify a ship could be consid-
ered as being mature in today’s world. Much progress has 
been made due to the electrification of the automotive 
sector, with major developments in batteries, motors, and 
associated components. This benefits other sectors too by 
bringing costs down and improving technology. Moreover, 
experience gained by use of electric ferries to date has 
proven the technologies overall reliability and feasibility for 
this purpose.United Kingdom  
The UK has set a target of zero emissions from the UK ferry 
fleet by 2050. This is based on the overarching Maritime 
2050 and Clean Maritime Plans , both published by the 
Department for Transport in 20199. The latter deals with the 
ferry services in the whole of the UK and related climate 
and environmental targets. Furthermore, the government 
has also launched the roadmap “Green Finance: A Roadmap 
to Sustainable Investing” which will support development 
of energy value chains needed for zero-emission maritime 
transport. 
Reducing emissions from the maritime sector is also part of 
the British Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution , 
launched in November 2020. In this document, the govern -
ment states that they “will position the UK at the forefront 
of aviation and maritime technology to push forward low 
carbon travel”, by establishing a 20 million GBP Clean Mari -
time Demonstration Programme. This inititative is currently 
supporting 55 projects across the UK.
Much of British ferry activity is in Scotland. Here, there are 
several state-funded projects for low- and zero-emission 
ferry transport and related energy production which have 
generally focused on hydrogen production and use. One 
example is the Orkney Islands Horizon 2020 project on 
hydrogen from wind for use in ferry traffic to the islands. 
On the Hebrides, also heavily dependent on ferry transport, 
there are projects concerning both hydrogen production

5. The frontrunner in Europe
Ferries are a key part of the Norwegian road transport 
system. With Norwegian fjords both wide and deep, many 
communities are based on hundreds of islands along the 
coast, and rely mainly on ferries as their link to other parts of 
the country. Norway is to date the largest ferry nation in 
Europe, with 180 ferries operating 112 routes. 
Over the last six years, the country has taken a world leading 
position on electric and hybrid car ferries. In 2015, Ampere 
became the world’s first fully electric car ferry. In 2022, more 
than 70 of Norway’s ferries will be fully or hybrid electric, 
with 10 more coming after 2022.10 These results help support 
the government’s target to achieve green transition in ship-
ping for all new ferry licensees delivering zero- or low-emis-
sion alternatives before 2023. Of around 330 vessels fitted 
with batteries for electric or hybrid propulsion globally, 
around 200 of them are in Norway. 
With Ampere commencing operations in 2015, Bellona and 
Siemens Energy conducted a study on the cost-saving poten-
tial for the remainder of the Norwegian fleet in replacing 
conventional diesel ferries with fully or hybrid electric ferries. 
The study focused on Ampere as an example vessel, looking 
at the construction process and operations involved. The 
2015 study concluded that more than 70% of Norwegian 
ferries would benefit economically from being replaced by 
either fully electric (47%) or hybrid electric (24 %) vessels. 
Most ferries in Norway operate on shorter routes, crossing 
fjords and between islands near the coast, and thus have an 
operational profile that favours electric or hybrid electric 
propulsion. Although the added investment costs of replacing 
diesel ferries with fully electric ferries at the time amounted 
to 3.5 billion NOK (€357 million) total, including grid 
upgrades in remote areas, the potential for operational cost 
savings were substantial. The estimate showed that over a 10-year period, the savings in operating costs amounted to 
700 million NOK (€71,4 million) annually. The study 
concluded that replacing the ferries that were economically 
feasible would save annual CO₂  emissions of 300 000 tons, 
equivalent to around 9 % of Norwegian domestic shipping 
emissions.
Public procurement and economic support 
as an effective tool for politicians 
Public procurement is the ultimate tool for the government to 
define the conditions for designing the function and perfor -
mance of public services like ferry route operations. Defining 
the tender‘s requirement as a zero-emission service and the 
rules for ferry operators, shipyards and suppliers. The expe-
rience in the National Road administration and the county 
administration has revolutionized the use of electric propul-
sion onboard with the procurement regime creating a win-
win situation for all parties involved. The first and required 
success factor is simply that the technology is available, the 
distances are manageable and the economy makes it feasible 
to implement and operate. 
And whilst it is more expensive to build a ferry with electric 
propulsion, funding and investment is now available through 
the ENOVA agency, which is ruled by the Norwegian Ministry 
of Climate and Environment. The agency has, up to now, 
supported 42 ferry routes, 53 electric ferries and 623 electric 
buses with 1.3 billion NOK (€132,5 million). 
This support will however be reduced over time. By February 
2022, the limit for funding from ENOVA for new ferries is up 
to 30 % of the additional cost for electric propulsion and even 
more for innovative projects. Overall, ferry policy in Norway 
has definitively been a success technologically, operationally 
and climate wise11. And other vessel types are benefitting too 
from the ferry operator’s overall experience gained through 
design, construction and operation.

6. Data source and Methodology 
Data and analysis  
The method to estimate the potential reduction of GHG emis-
sions from European countries is based on two data sources 
and a data model.  AIS data from ferries, Ro-PAX, passenger 
ships and ship registry data. This includes information on ship 
dimensions, installed engine power axillary engines, flag and 
ownership etc. 
The analysis for this fleet is performed by AIS data through 
DNVs transportation model and voyage mapping and between 
ports. Based on this data, calculation of emissions from ships, 
in port and under transit are calculated in a number of ways 
and for a number of different measures. 
The emissions under sailing for example are calculated and 
counted by speed and length of route. Whereas the emissions 
in port are calculated and counted by time in port (from arrival 
to departure). Selection 
• Ships in category passenger, passenger/general cargo, 
passenger/Ro-Ro cargo 
• Ships with design speed under 20 knots  
• Ships with capacity over 12 passengers 
• Ships under 75 000 GT 
• Ships with port of arrival in Europe and with a geographic 
limitation in the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, and the 
Atlantic Ocean (See map below)

Assumptions and limitations  
The calculation of emissions assume that no ships are connect-
ed to shore power in port because no information is available 
from the ship database or AIS data. 
The data contains outside sailing routes, like transport to yard, 
service locations and refueling. And also includes transporta-
tion from one route to another in different regions or coun-
tries. Vitaly this activity ensures the necessary service and 
maintenance between routes. 
The four main categories of emission reduction can be 
defined as: 
• Ships under 150 meters with duration (sailing time) under 
60 minutes give 100 % electrification and zero emission 
with full battery-electric propulsion. 
• Ships under 150 meters with duration over 60 minutes is 
subject to hybrid-electrification and zero emission in first 
60 minutes. 
• All ships over 150 meters are subject to hybrid-electrifica-
tion and zero emissions in the first 60 minutes of sailing 
are included in electrification or hybrid-electrification.  
• Sufficient electricity is available in all ports for shore pow -
er and charging power 
All selected vessels are also subject to retrofit or replacement 
(new builds) with electrification and performance and range.  
It is important to underline however that the generated esti-
mates are not from physical measurement and that numbers for one ship or one port can be inaccurate because of signal 
errors from AIS transmitters onboard or receivers on land. With 
the calculations and analysis giving the best possible average 
estimates for GHG emissions from the European ferry fleet. 
The collection of AIS (Automatic Identification System) data 
from ship movements, speed, course and position therefore 
form the main bulk of information. The data records are then 
aggregated and combined with more specific information from 
IHS fairplay Ship Registry which then enable us to create the 
emission estimates. 
The estimates however are solely for emission reduction from 
ships. The energy mix of electric energy from the shore grid 
are not 100 % renewable, generating GHG emissions from 
fossil fuels. According to IEA, the EU have a carbon intensity in 
power and heat generation of ~300 gCO₂ /kWh12. The European 
energy and heat generation are subject to reduce GHG emis-
sions in future and is not in the scope of this study. 
With regards to the four different measures to electrify the 
ships power use, we assume that ships up to 150 meters with 
transit duration of up to one hour are suitable for full electrifi-
cation.

Latest innovations in Grid Technologies
Simona Rossetti/ Alexander Rentschler 
Overview
The workshop, held over the course of one hour, featured insightful presentations and engaging discussions on latest innovati onsin Grid technologies. 
Participants from various backgrounds came together to share their perspectives and expertise, creating a dynamic and collabo rative learning environment.
Presentations
• Simona Rossetti delivered a compelling presentation on High Voltage Products. Key points included requirements for future transmission grids in a 
changing environment, digitalization as a mandatory element to manage the grid of the future and people as the heart of this transformation.
• Alexander Rentschler presented on latest developments in DC Grids, MVDC applications, and aspects of decreasing rotating mass in AC grids.
Discussions
The presentations were followed by a discussion session where attendees engaged with the speakers through questions and comme nts. Key discussion points 
included:
• Effects of high switching frequency of wide -bandgap power electronics on the isolation capability of existing equipment and harm onics
• Clear need of increasing grid capacity
• The high quality of grid stability and availability focus social discussions on generation instead on the key importance of a high performing and reliable grid
• Increasing need of young talents and enthuse young people to engage in electrical grid studies and career
• Choosing of the right technology to avoid a (too) early technological lock -in scenario

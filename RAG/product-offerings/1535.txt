a gas shortage in Europe
Our Operations
Our Suppliers
Our Customers•Activities started to reduce gas consumption in own operations
•Utilization of gas in operations mainly for heating and testing 
•Broad supplier network globally –risk mitigation actions in progress, 
if possible, route sourcing outside Europe for gas -intensive products, 
build up of safety stock, etc.
•Raw -material costs already affected due to high gas prices since 
February
•Fleet utilization remains currently stable in all regions
•Currently no signs of changing customer buying behavior towards gas 
turbine equipment
•Upgrade opportunity to increase efficiencies and reduce gas intensity

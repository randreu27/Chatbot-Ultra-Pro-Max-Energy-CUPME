Performance Serviceability Flexibility Rotor 
 Proven rotor design with internal cooling air passages 
for world-class fast (cold) start and hot restart 
capability
 Easy rotor de-stacking on site due to disc  
assembly with Hirth serration and central  
tie rod
   Bearings 
  Active clearance control with Hydraulic 
Clearance Optimization (HCO) for reduced 
degradation and clearance losses   Combustion
    Advanced can annular 
combustion system
 Compressor 
 Variable inlet guide vanes and three 
stages of fast acting variable-pitch  
guide vanes (VGV) for improved part  
load efficiency and high load transients 
 High efficiency due to evolutionary  
3D blading
 All rotating compressor blades replaceable 
without rotor lift or rotor de-stacking

• Remoteness of the energy system with lack of infra-
structure, e. g. inefficient grid
• Demand for carbon emission reduction 
• Need for improved plant control capabilities due to 
increased penetration of renewable energy
• Finding best business case / operation model for  
energy requirements (electricity, heat and cold)
• Increasing complexity of energy market
Solution
• Decentralized hybrid energy system overcoming 
 infrastructure deficiency
• One decarbonized solution by integration of different 
technologies (renewables, storage, fossil) 
• Advanced control capabilities integrating different 
technologies for easy operation and most efficient 
operation model (including grid services)
• Tailored solutions addressing various applications 
including heat, cold and power demands for local needs
• Integration of renewable technologies  providing access 
to public funding schemes

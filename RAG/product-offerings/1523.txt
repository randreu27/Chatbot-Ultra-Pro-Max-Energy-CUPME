This document  contains  statements  related  to our future  business  and financial  performance,  and future  events  or developments  involving  Siemens  Energy  that may constitute  
forward -looking  statements . These  statements  may be identified  by words  such  as “expect,”  “look  forward  to,” “anticipate”  “intend,”  “plan,”  “believe,”  “seek,”  “estimate,”  “will,”  
“project,”  or words  of similar  meaning . We may also make  forward -looking  statements  in other  reports,  prospectuses,  in presentations,  in material  delivered  to shareholders,  and in 
press  releases . In addition,  our representatives  may from time to time make  oral forward -looking  statements . Such  statements  are based  on the current  expectations  and certain  
assumptions  of Siemens  Energy’s  management,  of which  many  are beyond  Siemens  Energy’s  control . These  are subject  to a number  of risks,  uncertainties,  and other  factors,  
including,  but not limited  to, those  described  in disclosures,  in particular  in the chapter  “Report  on expected  developments  and associated  material  opportunities  and risks”  in the 
Annual  Report . Should  one or more  of these  risks or uncertainties  materialize,  should  acts of force  majeure,  such  as pandemics,  occur,  or should  underlying  expectations  including  
future  events  occur  at a later date or not at all, or should  assumptions  prove  incorrect,  Siemens  Energy’s  actual  results,  performance,  or achievements  may (negatively  or 
positively)  vary materially  from those  described  explicitly  or implicitly  in the relevant  forward -looking  statement . Siemens  Energy  neither  intends,  nor assumes  any obligation,  to 
update  or revise  these  forward -looking  statements  in light of developments  which  differ  from those  anticipated . This document  includes  supplemental  financial  measures  – that are 
not clearly  defined  in the applicable  financial  reporting  framework  – and that are or may be alternative  performance  measures  (non-GAAP -measures) . These  supplemental  financial  
measures  should  not be viewed  in isolation  or as alternatives  to measures  of Siemens  Energy’s  net assets  and financial  position  or results  of operations  as presented  in 
accordance  with the applicable  financial  reporting  framework  in its consolidated  financial  statements . Other  companies  that report  or describe  similarly  titled  alternative  performance  
measures  may calculate  them  differently . Due to rounding,  numbers  presented  throughout  this and other  documents  may not add up precisely  to the totals  provided  and

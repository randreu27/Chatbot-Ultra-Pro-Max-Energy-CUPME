The improved outlook reflects our confidence in the ongoing market opportunities and our excellent project execution. Even in light of the uncertain macroeconomic factors, our focus remains on profitable growth”, says Christian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy AG. After the strong start to the fiscal year, Siemens Energy's positive development continued in the recent quarter. Favorable market trends have led to a broad-based increase in demand for our products. In addition, Siemens Energy demonstrated strong project execution and operational performance in the quarter, to which all segments contributed. Overall, Siemens Energy achieved one of the strongest quarters ever. Siemens Energy's orders amounted to €14.4bn. This was 52.3% higher than in the prior-year quarter on a comparable basis (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects). In addition to sharp growth at Grid Technologies, the upturn was primarily due to Gas Services, which recorded the highest orders in a quarter to date. Book-to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) was again strong with 1.45, leading to a new record level of €133bn in the order backlog. Revenue increased double-digit in all segments. Overall, revenue grew by 20.7% on a comparable basis to €10.0bn. Siemens Energy's Profit before Special items amounted to €906m, reflecting a margin of 9.1%. All segments contributed to the increase year-over-year (Q2 FY 2024: €170m). Special items were negative €291m (Q2 FY 2024: positive €331m) primarily relating to the sale of the Indian wind business. Siemens Energy's Profit came in at €615m (Q2 FY 2024: €501m). Net income was €501m (Q2 FY 2024: €108m). The corresponding basic earnings per share amounted to €0.50 (Q2 FY 2024: €0.08). Free cash flow pre tax amounted to €1,390m, sharply increased compared to the prior-year's figure (Q2 FY 2024: €483m). Almost all segments contributed to this improvement. In addition to the profit development, this was primarily due to customer payments including reservation fees. Due to the positive business development, Siemens Energy updates the outlook for fiscal year 2025. Siemens Energy now expects for the Group to achieve comparable revenue growth in fiscal year 2025 in a range of 13% to 15% and a Profit margin before Special items between 4% and 6%. Siemens Energy expects a Net income of up to €1bn excluding assumed positive Special items subsequent to the demerger of the energy business from Siemens Limited, India. The outlook for Free cash flow pre tax for the fiscal year 2025 is updated to around €4bn. In April 2025, the government of the USA, among others, announced tariffs on imports from various countries. Siemens Energy is closely monitoring developments and continuously analysing their potential impact on its net assets, financial position and results of operations. For the second half of the fiscal year 2025, a limited direct impact on Siemens Energy’s Profit of up to a high double-digit million € amount, after mitigation measures, is currently expected.

Annual Shareholders' Meeting 2025: Joe Kaeser reelected as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy - February 20, 2025 To the speeches of Joe Kaeser, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, and Christian Bruch, President and CEO At today's virtual Annual General Meeting of Siemens Energy AG, the shareholders approved all items on the agenda by a large majority. At its peak, more than 1,074 people followed the webcast of the Annual General Meeting, with 59.92 percent of the voting shares represented. The actions of the Management Board for the past fiscal year 2024 were approved with a total of more than 99 percent of the votes. The past fiscal year closed with net income of EUR 1.3 billion and thus with a profit for the first time. A net loss of EUR 4.6 billion was recorded in the 2023 fiscal year. The Supervisory Board was formally discharged with an approval ratio of over 99 percent. In the elections to the Supervisory Board, which were held as scheduled after four years on the capital side, all candidates standing for election were confirmed by the Annual Gerneral Meeting – the exact voting results are available here . At the subsequent constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board, Joe Kaeser was unanimously elected as its Chairman. Dr. Hubert Lienhard was also unanimously elected Lead Independent Director, whose powers were significantly strengthened by a resolution of the Supervisory Board on December 11, 2024. The Lead Independent Director is now a permanent member of the Presiding Committee and the Nomination Committee as well as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. In the run-up to the Annual General Meeting, some investors had expressed concerns about the independence of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, although he was never CEO of Siemens Energy AG and left the former parent company Siemens AG more than four years ago. The appointment and additional responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director will further strengthen the quality of corporate governance in the company. Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, an independent management consultant in the energy sector and decarbonization of industry, and Dr. Feiyu Xu, Managing Director of Amber Iris AI Consulting GmbH, who is to represent the topic of artificial intelligence more strongly, were newly elected to the Supervisory Board. Ms. Dotzenrath received 99.77 percent and Ms. Xu received 98.16 percent of the votes at the Annual General Meeting. Dr. Christine Maria Bortenlänger and Hildegard Müller will leave the Supervisory Board as planned. Joe Kaeser, Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Chairman of the Annual General Meeting, emphasized: "Today's Annual General’s Meeting has shown that our shareholders are convinced of the operational strength and strategic direction of Siemens Energy. The confidence in the Managing Board under the leadership of Christian Bruch has been confidently confirmed. The structure of the Lead Independent Director function is unique in the German DAX and sends a clear signal to strengthen corporate governance in Germany. I look forward to working with the newly elected Supervisory Board and would like to thank the two departing members Christine Bortenlänger and Hildegard Müller for their valuable contributions over the past four years." The next Annual General Meeting of Siemens Energy AG will take place on February 26, 2026, as an in-person event in Berlin. You can find the full press release here . Siemens Energy Q1 FY25 Earnings Release - February 12, 2025 Strong start to the year – capitalizing on favorable market trends “Our strong first quarter reflects the market opportunities arising from the increasing demand for electricity. The strong cash flow was mainly driven by growth across all our businesses, advance payments and timing effects. Our focus lies still on profitable topline growth and technological leadership”, says Christian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy AG. Siemens Energy got off to a strong start to this new fiscal year. Demand for our products remained favorable and the strong order trends continued. The prior-year quarter’s figures for revenue, Profit before Special items and cash flow were clearly exceeded. All seg-ments contributed to the improvements. Orders of Siemens Energy amounted to €13.7bn. As expected, this was below the high level of the prior-year quarter, in which Grid Technologies and Transformation of Industry had booked exceptionally high orders. Book-to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) was 1.53, leading to a record order backlog of €131bn. Revenue of €8.9bn increased by 18.4% on a comparable basis (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) with all segments recording growth. Profit before Special items of Siemens Energy more than doubled year-over-year to €481m (Q1 FY 2024: €208m) again held back by results of Siemens Gamesa, but to a significantly lesser extent than in the prior-year quarter. Special items amounted to negative €18m (Q1 FY 2024: positive €1,670m, in connection with disposals). Siemens Energy's Profit came in at €463m (Q1 FY 2024: €1,878m). Net income was €252m (Q1 FY 2024: €1,582m). Corresponding basic earnings per share were €0.23 (Q1 FY 2024: €1.79). Free cash flow pre tax was materially stronger than expected at positive €1,528m (Q1 FY 2024: negative €283m) driven by project advance payments and timing effects of customer payments. All segments contributed to the improvement. Based on the development in the first quarter, management now expects that Siemens Energy will exceed the current Free cash flow pre tax guidance of up to €1bn and therefore intends to update the Free cash flow pre tax outlook for fiscal year 2025 with the half-year results for fiscal year 2025.

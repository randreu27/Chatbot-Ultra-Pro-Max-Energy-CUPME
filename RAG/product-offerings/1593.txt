Q3 FY2021 Siemens Energy Shareholder Letter Page 1Dear shareholders,
last Wednesday, just before thesummer break, our CEO
Christian Bruch andourCFO Maria Ferraro presented ourthird
quarter results forfiscal year 2021 .“Our activities atGas and
Power (GP) arefully ontrack and thesegment delivered as
planned .Atthe same time, weare not satisfied with the
performance ofSGRE (Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy)
which suffered asignificant setback intheturnaround ofthe
onshore business .This does notchange theattractive market
fundamentals for Siemens Energy, however due tothe
headwinds atSGRE wedonotexpect toreach thelowend of
the group margin guidance forthe fullyear” ,said Christian
Bruch .
Compared totheprevious two quarters weshowed lower
profitability because SGRE suffered anoperating loss and as
communicated already onJuly 14thwehad tocutourmargin
guidance fortheyear.Due tothefinancial performance at
SGRE’s onshore business inthe recent quarter and its
significantly lower profit expectations forthefiscal year 2021 ,
management now expects anAdjusted EBITA margin
before Special Items (SI)forSiemens Energy intherange
of2%tobelow 3%,compared toarange of3%to5%
previously .
The opportunities and mid-term outlook intheelectricity
and energy markets areintact and wecontinue todoour
homework toreap the opportunities and todeal with the
challenges .
AtGas &Power ourrestructuring program isprogressing well
outside ofGermany and inGermany theVoluntary Lever
program hasbeen wellreceived .Negotiations with theGerman
workers council stalled andwere escalated toanindependent
arbitration board .Wearestillconfident that wewillreach our
cost outtargets forfiscal year 2023 inorder toreach alevel of
profitability thatallows ustoinvest intheenergy transformation .
Wind isparamount toour success inthe energy
transformation and SGRE iswell positioned tocapitalize on
thisgrowth .However, fixing thecurrent performance issues isa
necessary precondition todoso.Hence, wearesupporting
SGRE management initsefforts toturnaround theonshore
business .
Orders were substantially down because SGRE had very
large offshore orders lastyear.Revenue returned togrowth
asboth SGRE and GPgrew .Our Adjusted EBITA before
Special Items of€54mimproved due toastrong
performance atGP.Ournetloss of€307mandbasic EPS of
neg€0.32decreased sharply versus theprior-year quarter .
Dear shareholders, thank youonce again foryour interest in
Siemens Energy .Ihope youstay healthy andwish yourelaxing
summer holidays .
Kind regards,

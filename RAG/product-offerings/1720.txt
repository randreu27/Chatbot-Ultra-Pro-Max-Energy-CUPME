The challenge  
Balancing efficiency and silence  
The evolving landscape of power transmission and distribu-
tion, reshaped by the surge of renewable energy sources, 
brings about a set of complex operational challenges for 
transformers. At the forefront is the dual imperative of di-
minishing noise pollution and bolstering operational effi-
ciency  — crucial for the sustainable growth of urban envi-
ronments and the resilience of power networks.  
 
The increased incorporation of direct current (DC) bias in 
our electrical grids is not without its concerns. It poses sig-
nificant issues related to the acoustic impact and energy ef-
ficiency of transformers  — factors that are becoming in-
creasingly critical in our densely populated cities. Our cut-
ting-edge DC compensation technology directly addresses 
these issues. It is the culmination of our commitment to in-
novation, ensuring that transformers function with remark-
able silence and peak efficiency. By signifi cantly reducing 
energy losses, we're not just meeting the existing bench-
marks but setting new ones for a future -ready grid.  
 
 
The DC compensation system neutralizes 
the effects of unwanted DC bias without 
semiconductor components . 
 
 
 Our solution  
Advancing transformer resilience  
The pursuit of excellence in transformer technology has led 
to an extensive investigation into the effects of direct cur-
rent (DC) in the power supply grid and its impact on trans-
formers. The quest for a viable solution has unearthed sev-
eral traditional methods, each with its inherent drawbacks. 
Simply replacing transformers does not tackle the core is-
sue, while constructing external noise protection walls is 
often a financial ly and spatially impractical endeavor. 
Moreover, the implementation of DC blockers has proven 
insufficient, especially when faced with the complexity of 
asymmetric loading conditions.  
In response to these conventional shortcomings, a forward -
thinking approach has been developed that shifts the focus 
from blocking the DC load to mitigating its effects on trans-
former performance.

Noise reduction and improved  
efficiency in a single solution

there is no additional burden placed on neighboring trans-
formers in the grid.  
 
Refinement of this approach has led to the development of 
advanced solutions tailored to various transformer configu-
rations. Initially designed for single -phase and three -phase 
units with three -leg cores, the technology has been adeptly 
modified to accommodate a wider range of core structures. 
This expansion of technology demonstrates a commitment 
to versatility and addresses the diverse challenges pre-
sented by DC currents in modern power systems.  
 
 
 
Special technical aspects  
DC effects on transformers  
 
The inherent magnetic properties of transformer cores 
make them sensitive to the presence of direct current (DC), 
where even a minimal DC component can precipitate sig-
nificant consequences. Among these are an elevated de-
mand for reactive power current and the subsequent am-
plification of losses. Empirical evidence supports this; for 
instance, a single -phase transformer subjected to a DC load 
of merely 1.0 A was observed to incur a 30% increase in 
losses.  
 
Furthermore, the imposition of DC loading can exacerbate 
acoustic emissions from transformers. Precision measure-
ments conducted have revealed that an asymmetric DC cur-
rent of just 0.14 A can result in a noise escalation of up to 
17 dB(A), a substantial aud itory impact. Confronted with these findings, the imperative was clear: to engineer a 
method that would enable transformers to operate with an 
immunity to DC loads, thus preserving their efficiency and 
acoustic integrity.

ple of DC compensation:  The effect of the existing DC current IDC on 
the transformer core is canceled out by the compensation current 
IDCC.  
 
Noise reduction with DC compensation  
 
The essence of the DC compensation strategy employed 
within these transformers is to embrace rather than ob-
struct the flow of DC current. The technique involves the 
ingenious creation of a compensatory magnetic field 
within the transformer core, which is d esigned to neutral-
ize the field generated by the prevalent DC current. This 
balancing act is achieved through the introduction of an 
additional winding within the transformer, aptly named the 
compensation winding.  
 
The control unit plays a pivotal role in  this process, meticu-
lously calculating the requisite DC current to supply to the 
compensation winding. When this calculated current flows 
through the compensation winding, it produces a magnetic 
field that effectively counterbalances the field induced by 
the DC current on the grid side. The result is a harmonious 
cancellation within the core, restoring the transformer's 
core to its optimal AC field during typical operation.  
 
Empirical measurements stand as a testament to the effec-
tiveness of this method; t hey demonstrate that the imple-
mentation of DC compensation can substantially, if not en-
tirely, mitigate the noise level increases typically associated 
with DC effects on transformers.

 DC detection and analysis  
A two -step -approach creating transparency on DC bias  
The free of charge DC detection app transforms any 
smartphone into a DC detection device and can be used by 
any person at site. The app record s the transformer noise, 
processes the audio data, and indicates potential DC bias.  
In case DC is detected, a comprehensive sound spectrum 
analysis provided by transformer service ex-
perts creates full transparency on potential 
DC bias issues and gives recommendations.  
This enables informed decisions regarding 
service, retrofitting for DC -ready transform-
ers, and investment or replacement options.  
 
 
DC ready  
Preparing transformers to be ready for DC compensa-
tion  
The DC -ready design enables the subsequent DC measure-
ment and DC compensation. The active parts of these 
transformers are already equipped with all required compo-
nents, like compensation windings, internal measurement 
sensors, and connections. These compact components, not 
reliant on sem iconductor or electronic sensors, are used for 
DC compensation (step 3), making minor modifications for 
DCC-Ready straightforward without impacting the trans-
former’s longevity or operation, and enabling a smooth ret-
rofit of DCC in the future . 
 
 
DC compensation  
Eliminated DC in the asset and reduction of no -load loss 
and noise impacts  
The compensation device is connected to the DC  ready sys-
tem. It constantly analyses the DC effect on the trans-
former and generates necessary direct current needed for 
compensation. The compensation windings installed in the 
DC ready design are generating a magnetic field in the core 
to counteract the field produced by DC current. The re-
quired DC current is determined by sensors at the active 
part and controlled by a control unit. The DC effects on 
transformer noise and loss level can be nearly completely 
eliminated.

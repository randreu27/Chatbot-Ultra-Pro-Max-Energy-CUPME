Virtual AGM
January 2023 © Siemens Energy, 20234Virtual format of Shareholders‘ Meeting on February 7, 2023 
Authorization to provide that AGMs can be held virtually for 2 years
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting 2023 shall be held as virtual meeting in accordance 
with the new provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act.
▪Under the new legal framework, virtual format is not a “second best option” 
compared to a physical AGM (as was during COVID -19 crisis), but now ensures that 
full scope of all shareholders’ rights that can be exercised in a physical meeting 
can also be exercised in the virtual AGM, including live interaction between 
management and shareholders
▪Virtual AGM offers opportunity for all shareholders (including international 
shareholders) to participate –no travel required and limited efforts for all 
shareholders, therefore at the same time being a sustainable format with lower costs
▪Virtual AGM offers greater planning security than physical AGM –Pandemic 
situation remains dynamic which makes organization of a physical AGM challenging
▪Amendment of Articles of Association regarding virtual shareholders’ meetings 
limited to 2 years –Decision on a yearly basis
Live Interaction with shareholders

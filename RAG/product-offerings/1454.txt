strong orders andproject execution across allourbusinesses .Our
focus remains onprofitable growth, supported byhighly favorable
market conditions .The new mid-term targets until fiscal year 2028
reflect ourleading role intheenergy transition” ,said Christian
Bruch .
During Q4,SE's markets continued todevelop favorably .This
was reflected inastrong order intake of€15.0bngrowing by42.3%
onacomparable basis1which was mainly driven bylarge orders at
Grid Technologies (GT) and Gas Services (GS) .Our book -to-bill
ratio (ratio oforders torevenue) was 1.54,leading toanorder
backlog of€123bnatyear-end once more exceeding theprevious
high.Revenue of€9.7bnwas upby16.6%onacomparable basis1
largely duetoGTandSiemens Gamesa (SG), where theongoing
ramp -updrove strong revenue growth intheoffshore business .SE’s
Profit before Special items was negative with €83m(Q4FY23:
negative €487m)duetotheexpected loss atSG.SEincurred aNet
lossof€254m(Q4FY23:Netloss€870m)inthequarter .
Forthefullfiscal year,SEachieved orexceeded theupgraded
guidance forallkey performance indicators .SGmade clear
progress inline with expectations .Driven byGTand GS, SE’s
orders exceeded thehigh level oftheprior fiscal year by0.9%ona
comparable basis1andreached €50.2bn.Revenue of€34.5bnrose
by12.8%onacomparable basis1driven bygrowth inallsegments .
Profit before Special items increased topositive €345m(FY23:
negative €2,776m)mainly driven byasharp loss reduction atSG,
butalso duetosharp profit improvements atGTandTransformation
ofIndustry .Profit came inatpositive €2,383m(FY23:negative
€2,960m).Netincome was €1,335m(FY23:Netloss €4,588m)and
corresponding Earnings perShare were positive at€1.37(FY23:
negative €5.47).Free cash flow pre taxincreased sharply to€1,859m(FY23:€784m)despite ahigher negative cash flow atSG
which wasmore than offset byincreases inallother segments .
InFY25,weexpect comparable revenue growth inarange of8%to
10%andaProfit margin before Special items between 3%and5%
forSE.Furthermore, weexpect aNetincome around break -even2
andFree cash flow pretaxupto€1bn.Due tothesuccess inthe
recent fiscal year and the good prospects forthe next and
subsequent fiscal years –interms ofthemarket environment and
ourbusiness plan –weclearly upgraded themid-term growth
and profitability targets forFY28.We now intend toachieve
compound annual revenue growth onacomparable basis1inahigh
single -digit tolowdouble -digit percentage range until FY28.Forthe
Profit margin infiscal year 2028 ,westrive toreach arange between
10%to12%.

Weareacting inavery favorable market environment .Population growth, arising standard ofliving andelectrification of
transport aswellasindustrial processes willcontinue todrive additional electricity consumption atarateof2.5%to3%per
year.This means thatevery year electricity consumption willgrow bytheequivalent oftheconsumption ofJapan, theworld’s
fourth largest economy .
This, however, isonly thebase case .Therapid riseofelectricity demand fordata centers also driven bytheuseofartificial
intelligence models isanadditional upside .By2030 itmay lead toanadditional increase inelectricity consumption of
1,500TWh .1,500TWh isroughly equivalent tothree times theelectricity consumption ofGermany, theworld’s third largest
economy .Tocope with thebase case growth scenario ofelectricity consumption, global power generation capacity hasto
double by2040 asrenewables account forabigger share oftheinstalled base .
Considering thatalarge partoftheexisting coal andoilplants willbetaken outofservice, itbecomes clear thatwearefacing

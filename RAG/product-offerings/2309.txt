 9.0 Piston Assembly Piston and rod asse mbly is held together by a Supernut 
style piston nut. 
 
  9.1 Piston Design Configuration 
 
     4.75 –  8.50 Cyls. Solid, 1 piece design, ductile iron. 
      9.00 – 15.00 Cyls. Cored du ctile iron, 2 piece design (vented). 
 
   16.25 – 20.50 Cyls. Cored aluminum, 2 piece design (vented).  Pistons are 
anodized and Teflon impregnated. 
 
  9.2 Piston Rings  
   Combination Rings Ring functions as a compression ring and rider band in 
one.  On bores 10.50" and larger, ring is a single piece step cut.  Rings smaller than 10.50" come as 2 piece. 
 
  10.0 Piston Rod  One piece heat treated alloy steel, 8-16 RMS finish in 
packing travel area, rolled threads. 
    Option              Age Hardened 17-4 PH Stainless Steel (HRC=26-33) with  
Siemens Energy TC3 coating in packing travel area.  HRC 
of coating = 70.  6-10 RMS finish. 
 
  11.0 Piston Rod Packing Full floating ring type, consisting of segmented rings 
attached by Inconel garter springs in annular cups, loaded 
by a bolted flange-like gland.  Fully lubricated (one lube point ) and vented. 
 
  11.1 Ring Types and No.  
     4 types, 6 pairs:  1 pressure breaker, 3 sealing, 1 tangent 
and 1 oil scraper ring. 
 
  11.2 Ring Descriptions 
    Pressure Breaker Consists of a single, gapped carbon and graphite filled 
PTFE pressure ring cut radially into equal segments with 
pressure relief grooves on outer face and a solid metallic back-up ring.  Rings are located in the cup closest to the 
pressure. 
 
Siemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG.    
   Sealing Rings Comprised of a carbon and graphite filled PTFE packing 
ring and a solid metallic back-up ring having no cuts.  This 
arrangement seals in one dire ction.  The ERC ring always 
faces the pressure. 
 
   Tangent Rings Consists of one pair made up of two double acting 
tangentially cut carbon and graphite filled PTFE packing rings. 
 
   Oil Scraper Rings Comprised of three cast iron radial cut unidirectional rings. 
Each ring has a double scraping edge and drainage slots 
on one face.  The drainage slots must face away from the 
oil side. 
 
 
 12.0 Cylinder Lubrication 
 
  12.1 System Configuration Distribution Block Type - mech anical force feed lubricator 
driven off crankshaft with individual pumping unit(s) 
manifolded together and fed into divider block system.  
Divider valves w/cycle counters, filter(s), rupture disk, check valves and proximity switch included.  316 stainless 
steel tubing.  Swagelok stainless steel fittings. 
    Option (Standard when Pump to Point mechanical force feed 
lubricator driven off pressures exceed 3000 psig) 
crankshaft with individual pumping units for each lubrication feed.  316 stainless steel tubing.  Swagelok 
stainless steel fittings. Check valves are included. 
    Option Electric Driven Lubricator. 
 
   Option Digital No-Flow Timer.  
  12.2 Lube Points Two cylinder lube poi nts, one centered at the top and the 
other at the bottom.  One lube point for all packing. 
 
 13.0 Valves  
  13.1 Valve Type Siemens Energy High Speed HammerHead Valves.  
Consists of valve seat, stop plate, elements & springs.    Non-metallic (PEEK) valve plate. 
 
  13.2 Valve Assembly All cylinders have barrel type crabs and O-ring sealed 
valve covers.  All assemblies are polarized so that an inlet 
valve cannot be installed in a discharge port.

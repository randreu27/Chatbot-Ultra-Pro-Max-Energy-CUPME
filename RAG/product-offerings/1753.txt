Globally standardized design
Siemens
 Energy SPS2S 362 kV dead tank circuit breakers 
utilize the
 time-tested FA spring- spring operating 
mechanism and 3AP a rc assist interrup ter common to the 
entire SPS2 portfolio  
(15 kV – 550 kV).
Siemens Energy has delivered over 16 0,000 breakers 
worldwide, with
 ove r 46,000 SPS2 circuit breakers to the US 
market alone since release in 1997.St

INFORMATION AND FORWARD -LOOKING STATEMENTS This document contains statements related to our future business and financial perfor mance, and future events or 
developments involving Siemens Energy that may constitute forward -looking statements. These statements may be identified by word s such as “expect,” “look forward to,” 
“anticipate” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “will,” “project,” or words of similar meaning. We may also mak e forward -looking statements in other reports, prospectuses, 
in presentations, in material delivered to shareholders, and in press releases. In addition, our representatives may from tim e to time make oral forward -looking statements. Such 
statements are based on the current expectations and certain assumptions of Siemens Energy ´s management, of which many are beyond Siemens Energy ´s control. These are 
subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those described in disclosures , in particular in the chapter “Report on expected 
developments and associated material opportunities and risks” in the Annual Report. Should one or more of these risks or unce rtainties materialize, should acts of force majeure, 
such as pandemics, occur, or should underlying expectations including future events occur at a later date or not at all, or s hould assumptions prove incorrect, Siemens Energy ´s 
actual results, performance, or achievements may (negatively or positively) vary materially from those described explicitly o r implicitly in the relevant forward -looking statement. 
Siemens Energy neither intends, nor assumes any obligation, to update or revise these forward -looking statements in light of dev elopments which differ from those anticipated. This 
document includes supplemental financial measures –that are not clearly defined in the applicable financial reporting framework –and that are or may be alternative performance 
measures (non -GAAP -measures). These supplemental financial measures should not be viewed in isolation or as alternatives to meas ures of Siemens Energy ´s net assets and 
financial position or results of operations as presented in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework in i ts consolidated financial statements. Other companies 
that report or describe similarly titled alternative performance measures may calculate them differently. Due to rounding, nu mbers presented throughout this and other documents 
may not add up precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.

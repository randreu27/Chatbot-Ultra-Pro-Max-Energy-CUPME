Performance Indicator Overview
¹  Due to the simplified approach in fiscal year 2022, there is no prior year information on taxonomy-aligned shares available. A prior year comparison of the total taxonomy-eligible shares is only possible to a limited extent due to the 
first-time application of the complementary delegated act on natural gas und nuclear activites.

² Index measuring willingness of customers to recommend a company’s products or services to others, Siemens Energy (excluding Siemens Gamesa). 
³ Includes category “use of sold products” only (well-to-tank emissions are included, biogenic emissions have been excluded). Siemens Gamesaʼ emissions equal zero.
⁴  Includes categories “purchased goods and services“ and “transportation and distribution” only. 2022 data was adjusted to include Siemens Gamesa. Due to the partially undefined material codes of the purchasing volume at Siemens Gamesa, approximately 10% of the CO2e emissions were extrapolated. In fiscal year 2023, 325 kilotons of the 9,230 
kilotons CO2e emissions were calculated using a consumption-based method.
⁵  Fiscal year 2022 emissions were recalculated to reflect the reduction of the expected lifetime for gas and steam turbines in power generation from 30 years to 28 years and the H2 co-firing project in fiscal year 2022.

¹⁰  The share of full-scale LCAs is calculated based on the business segment structure. One business segment is considered to be one portfolio element. All portfolio elements containing material products have been determined to be relevant for this performance indicator. If full-scale LCAs are available for products of a portfolio element, this portfolio 
element is considered to be covered. The share represents the percentage of covered portfolio elements relative to the total number of relevant portfolio elements. 
¹¹ Due to the inclusion of customer-specific analyses, 82 full-scale LCAs and 85 EPDs have been added to the totals of 2022. These customer-specific analyses were calculated in 2022 but not considered in last yearʼs figures. The addition does not affect the portfolio coverage of 2022.
¹²  Total Recordable Injury Rate: Number of recordable injuries (TRI) x 1,000,000/work hours performed. Recordable injuries are accidents that result in lost time, restricted work, or medical treatment. Employees include temporary workers; excl. contractors. Siemens Gamesa has aligned with Siemens Energy definitions of worker type in fiscal year 2023: 
Temporary workers, previously included with contractors, were included with the Siemens Energy employees for fiscal year 2023.

¹⁴  Contractors are service providers carrying out work activities in a work environment under the control of the company. Siemens Gamesa captures all contractors; Siemens Energy (excluding Siemens Gamesa) captures contractors in projects with a volume >€5 million and classified as complex during the bid phase.
¹⁵ Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate: number of lost time injuries (LTI) x 1,000,000/work hours performed. LTIs are accidents that result in at least one lost day of work.
¹⁶ Number of occupational illnesses x 1,000,000/work hours performed. Illnesses declared as an occupational illness and recognized by an external authority/insurance company or by a physician.

²³  Numbers for disciplinary sanctions in a fiscal year do not necessarily correspond to cases reported during that period: sanctions are frequently not implemented in the same year in which the case was reported or the investigation – which follows a defined process – was completed. In addition, a single case may result in multiple sanctions, or none at all.

³⁴ Ratio between the average salary of a median employee versus our top-paid person.
³⁵  Figures relate to Siemens Energy using a new methodology to calculate the fiscal year 2023 figures. An unadjusted pay gap refers to the difference between the earnings of men vs. women (mean male vs. female FTE Total Direct Compensation in € using actual payout values based on incentive payout ratios from the previous fiscal year converted to 
hourly rates) that could arise from differences in a number of factors, for example, job families, geography, relative value of the position, seniority, or gender. An adjusted pay gap refers to the part of this difference between the earnings of men vs. women that is attributable solely to gender. The pay gap KPI is expressed as the difference between the 
mean male pay vs. the mean female pay, divided by the mean male pay. A positive pay gap KPI is one in favor of men, a negative in favor of women.
³⁶  Fiscal year 2022 figures relate to Siemens Energy (excluding Siemens Gamesa). For fiscal year 2023, according to the previous year’s methodology, the adjusted pay gap is 5.30% and the unadjusted pay gap is 8.86%.

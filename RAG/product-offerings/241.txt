What if you could get 24/7 support from an expert team with extensive know-how of total plant operation and troubleshooting? Siemens Energy Remote Experts will help you stay online or quickly get you back on the grid. Contact us Find out how ROMS supports your operation Siemens Energy Remote Support Center ROMS key benefits Speed: Faster troubleshooting Immediate access to all data in T3000 – real time See what operator sees at the same moment Access to functional drawings, including dynamization Safety: Compliant with cybersecurity standards ISO 27001 certified (IT and information security) Read-only access Proven remote connection via Siemens cRSP Target customers Large gas-fired plants Siemens Energy turbines Open and Combined cycle Combined cycle or open cycle power plant Solutions for various operator demands Eco: Pay per use 24/7 hotline for sporadic use Basic: Prepaid account 24/7 hotline for frequent and urgent use Basic and Eco Packages Service Options 1. Basic Package ROMS Basic covers the entire power plant, provides expedited start- and response times, and is therefore particularly suited for time-sensitive operational issue resolution. Actual service hours are booked against a pre-paid hour-account that can be easily recharged. In comparison, for equipment covered by a Siemens Energy service contract. 2. Eco Package For equipment covered by a Siemens Energy service contract ROMS Eco is included, to the extend specified in the contract. Hours for additional scope are collected and invoiced on a semi-annual basis. Customer Benefits Fastest way to troubleshoot problems in entire plant operations Accelerated solving of issues increases reliability of plant Supplement of on site know-how for safe and reliable operation Expert opinion on plant status Exclusive access to Siemens O&M and Engineering know-how Two payment models to cover different support demand Priority case resolution For very time critical incidents, a priority case resolution is available. The customer can specify a desired resolution time between one and six hours. Only if the case is solved within this specified time, factors are applied to the hours spent. If not, the hours will be charged without factor. Shadowing for operators The ROMS expert center can also provide live online operator backing for critical operational states and processes. Customer Benefits Smooth operation in challenging phases due to online backing Immediate reaction / problem solving increases availability of plant Supplement of on-site know-how for safe and reliable operation Online expert opinion of plant status Easy to add on demand in addition to other existing packages A long track record of succesful support cases Optimization of combustion stability GT turbine outlet thermocouples were exchanged and recalibrated on site, which lead to a different OTC value measurement and combustion problems – OTC increased to stabilize combustion CCPP Power Plant in Europe Software logic modification implemented in EKT system Fluctuations of gas temperature prevented the temperature setpoint from being reached, causing efficiency losses. Software logic modification implemented CCPP Power Plant in Europe Logic modification in Unit Controller GT not able to increase load after synchronization. Troubleshooting and modification in process logic CCPP Power Plant in Asia Deaerator logic optimization Plant trip due to deaerator malfunction. Troubleshooting and correction of software settings CCPP Power Plant in Asia Participation in ST cold start Support of local personnel during the entire startup process. Assistance and recommendations given for successful start CCPP Power Plant in Asia Optimization of startup behavior in fuel oil operation Readjustment of GT startup after several trips due to too high OTC Open Cycle Power Plant in Middle East Detected malfunction of warm-holding logic in HRSG Troubleshooting and correction of process logic CCPP Power Plant in Middle East Value Proposition Fast Emergency Response Remote Experts can directly start communicating with on-site operators to manage emergencies as they can see what the operator sees on his controls Saves time and costs and speeds up the process to get back on the grid Increase reliability and reduce risks caused by operation Avoid penalty payments to grid operator for not meeting contractual obligations Avoid unwanted shutdowns caused by operational issues Avoid equipment damage caused by unfavorable operation Flexibility in provisioning of qualified staff for plant operation Use Siemens remote expertise on demand instead of staffing own highly skilled experts Get faster access to OEM know-how instead of flying in experts Remote assistance and on-the-job training for your operation staff, e.g. for beginners or after major changes in plant Keep plant up and running under difficult security conditions In case of armed conflicts, pandemics, etc., Remote Experts can step in for specific tasks Remote Experts will advise remaining on-site staff for safe operation of plant Do you need more information about the ROMS Service?

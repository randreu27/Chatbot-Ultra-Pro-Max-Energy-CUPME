The implementation of renewables challenges system strength 
Challenges
• Mostly non-synchronous, connected
via power electronic converters
• Displace existing generation
• Located in remote part of the grid
• Multiple plants are close to each other
• Growing HVDC connections
• Growth of renewable generationSynchronous

Inertia and short circuit power are the key factors for a strong system. Inertia reduces 
oscillation on grid frequency and prevents system blackouts. Short circuit power 
guarantees a reliable system protection.
For a stabile grid operation an amount of synchronous generator is necessaryInertia and short circuit power in 
sufficient way can only be provided 
by synchronous generator with or 
without Flywheel

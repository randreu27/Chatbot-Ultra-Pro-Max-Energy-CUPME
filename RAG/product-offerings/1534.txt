We expect a sharp reduction of Net loss compared to fiscal

We expect free cash flow pretax to be in a negative range 
of low -to mid -triple -digit million (actual figure FY 2022:

The outlook for Siemens Energy assumes no major negative 
financial impacts from COVID -19 or other pandemic related 
events, no further deterioration in the supply chain and raw 
material cost environment, and excludes charges related to 
legal and regulatory matters.The assumptions for Gas Services, Grid Technologies and Transformation of Industry

The application of a circuit breaker directly correlates to the operating conditions that will be 
serviced over the breaker’s lifetime. Siemens Energy’s circuit breaker portfolio was designed to adapt to your current and future needs across all applications. From transmission line protection to specialized controlled switching applications and high kA requirements, Siemens Energy circuit breakers can be configu ed to meet the needs of the application.
High kA short-circuit capabilities are becoming 
increasingly important for circuit breaker 
applications in evolving power systems. Where high 
kA ratings are necessary, extreme transient 
recovery voltage (TRV) conditions and high X/R 
ratios are common. To meet the needs of these 
applications, Siemens Energy offers robust, time-
tested technology that you can rely on to meet the 
current and future needs of your power system.
Independent pole operation (IPO) configu  ed circuit 
breakers in conjunction with phase synchronizing 
device (PSD) controlled switching can provide 
increased system reliability as a result of reduced 
voltage fluctuations and l  wer harmonic stress. IPO 
circuit breakers with PSD are also known to extend 
the service life of the circuit breaker’s interrupter 
components by reducing switching over-voltages 
and inrush currents.
Pre-insertion resistors (PIR) limit TRV impacts on 
circuit breakers in transmission line protection 
applications  . These components are capable of 
smoothing reclosing operations by dissipating 
trapped charge on the affected transmission line 
phase(s). Siemens Energy PIR technology can be 
configu  ed with various resistance values and 
externally adjustable pre-insertion times to meet 
the needs of your system.Siemens  Energy  circuit  breakers  meet  the needs  of the 
world’s most complex electrical power systems

Siemens Energy recognizes climate change as a megatrend that is  
changing the world. SF 6, the insulating gas utilized in most modern  
gas insulated equipment (GIE) boasts a global warming potential 
of 23,500x that of CO 2. In a revolutionary development for high 
voltage GIE, Siemens developed CLEAN AIR vacuum technology  
that is capable of reliable short-circuit interruption at voltage levels 
above 69 kV with absolutely zero CO 2 emissions over the lifetime of  
the equipment.
Tested to the same IEEE / IEC standards as SF 6 product equivalents, 
Siemens Energy Blue Circuit BreakerTM products offer high reliability 
and performance that is expected of HV GIE. Other inherent 
benefits of vacuum-interruption include applicability at low 
ambient temperatures, higher full-fault duty than equivalent SF 6 
products (rated for up to 30 interruptions at rated short-circuit  
currents), and maintenance-free operation due to hermetically  
sealed vacuum interrupter components  .
Driven by the reliable FA spring-spring mechanism, Blue Circuit 
BreakerTM will utilize time-tested components to provide class M2 
mechanical endurance (10,000 operations) and Class C2 capacitive 
switching certifications. 
Siemens Energy plans to offer Blue Circuit BreakerTM and circuit  
switchers in accordance with the accompanying release schedule.

133AP arc-assist interrupter and FA 
spring- spring operating mechanism
The FA spring-spring operating mechanism is unique in 
the industry because of its scalable design that is applied 
in Siemens Energy’s entire circuit breaker portfolio for 
rated voltages between 15 kV to 800+ kV. Unlike all 
hydraulic or pneumatic operating mechanisms, the FA 
spring-spring design is inherently maintenance-free for 
the breaker’s installed lifetime.

Siemens Energy utilizes the field-p oven 3AP arc-assist 
interrupter. Arc-assist interruption technology is the core 
of Siemens’ HV switchgear because it has a substantially 
smaller operating mechanism energy requirement in 
comparison to preceding puffer interrupter technology. 
Each interrupter consists of a main contact assembly and 
an arcing contact mounted inside a pole unit housing. 
During opening operations, the puffer action in the 
compression cylinder of the interrupter is sufficient or low 
current faults and switching operations. During high 
current interruptions, heat from the arc causes the 
pressure to rise in the heating volume chamber. The 
resulting high pressure gas from the heating volume 
extinguishes the arc.

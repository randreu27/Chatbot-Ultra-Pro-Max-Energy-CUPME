Product Stewardship, p. 48-51Product safety encompasses the safety of all products, solutions, and services manufactured, provided, and/or sold by Siemens 
Energy. These products, solutions, and services are developed according to the latest technical knowledge and comply with applica-
ble legal requirements to ensure that they do not pose an unacceptable risk to life, health, property, or the environment. Product 
stewardship at Siemens Energy follows the key standards of the ISO 14000 series, with individual approaches for each Business Area. 
The approaches are centrally supported by the respective Global Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) departments. In fiscal year 
2024, improvement measures included the introduction of product safety issue handling and risk assessment procedures at the 
corporate level as well as continued product safety awareness training (approximately 4,600 colleagues had participated in this 
training by the end of the fiscal year). Numerous workshops have been held to analyze our strengths and weaknesses and collaborate 
to better serve our customers, both internal and external. During fiscal year 2024, two significant product safety incidents were 
reported. One incident was related to safety issues in the design of service lifts in some Siemens Gamesa wind turbine types. The 
issue is being addressed in accordance with our TE function through the implementation of design changes and retrofits. The other is 
still under investigation, after the explosion of gas dryer equipment in September 2024. We sent a warning to all customers with this 
equipment and will consider lessons learned for design and development.

Product Stewardship, p. 48-51We aim to comply with all legal requirements, such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals), 
RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances), our SAP systems and similar international requirements. Siemens Energy uses globally 
standardized materials and substance registers for restricted and declarable substances and products. The updated ECHA list identi-
fies any substances that need to be declared for each product (ECHA = European Chemicals Agency). As part of the Siemens Energy 
supplier assessment and qualification process, suppliers are required to identify whether any of their products or components contain 
substances that need to be declared according to the specific legislation. Suppliers then need to provide a detailed declaration should 
any such substances be used within their design and manufacturing activities.
We encourage our suppliers to use the industry substance management platform BOMCheck to share declarations for Substances of 
Very High Concern (SVHCs) and link this information to our IT systems. In this way, we can actively manage risks related to substance 
restrictions. The implementation of the Substances of Concern in Products (SCIP) reporting requirement, a database established under 
the EUʼs Waste Framework Directive that registers products containing SVHCs, has been set up in a Sharepoint for data collection.

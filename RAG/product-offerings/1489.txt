Siemens Energy delivers  a successful  first  
full fiscal year  
• Revenue  increase d, order backlog at €83.8 billion  
• Measures to improve competitiveness in Gas and Power segment are taking  effect:   
operational profitability improved significantly

• Executive Board and Supervisory Board intend to propose a dividend of € 0.10  per share  
 
Managing still challenging market conditions , Siemens Energy has successfully completed its first  
full fiscal year as an independent company. At its Annual Press Conference in Munich today, the 
energy technology company present s its key financial figures for fiscal year 2021, which ended on 
September 30 , 2021 . Results will be announced for  the Gas and Powe r Segment and the Siemens 
Energy Group as a whole . The second reporting segment Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy 
(SGRE), which is listed as an independent company on the Spanish stock exchange, already 
presented its financial figures  on November  5. 
 
“I'm pleased with our first full fiscal year performance as a stand -alone company. The team did an 
excellent job and laid the foundation for our transformation in a challenging market environment , 
and I am particularly pleased with our progress in the Gas and P ower segment where we improved 
our operational profitability. Siemens Energy has posted a net loss primarily due to the planned 
restructuring measures and the known problems  in the onshore business of Siemens Gamesa 
Renewable Energy. Looking forward, we wi ll continue to focus on our plan to increase profitability 
which puts us on track to achieve our mid -term targets ,” says Christian Bruch, CEO of Siemens 
Energy AG.  
 
Order s at Siemens Energy remained high at €33 billion. Although orders decreased moderate ly, by 
2.9% year -over-year, this was expected , on the one hand d ue to currency translation effects, on the 
other hand  because  SGRE reported an exceptionally high  order s in the past fiscal year. In the Gas Press  release

and Power segment, the Transmission business made a particular ly positive contribution to order 
intake with major orders for high -voltage direct current transmission (HVDC), including the 
SuedOstLink and SuedLink projects in Germany. With its HVDC technology, Siemens Energy is one of 
the industry leaders and  is involved in Germany's largest energy infrastructure project , SuedLink . 
Recently , Siemens Energy was also  awarded its first large -scale offshore grid connection project in 
the USA , off the coast of New York State . Siemens Energy, in a consortium with Norway's Aker 
Solutions, will supply the  HVDC transmission system that will transport the green electricity  the 50 
kilometers from the wind farm to the mainland.  
The order backlog  at the  Group level was €83.8 billion a t the end of fiscal year  2021 . Siemens 
Energy's revenue  increased by 3.7% to €28.5 billion in fiscal year 2021 due to growth in both 
segments and was within the guidance  range.  
 
Significant growth in operating profit  
 
With Adjusted EBITA before Special Items  of €661 million, earnings improved significantly in fiscal 
year 2021. In the prior year , a loss of €17 million was recorded. This was mainly due to operating 
improvements in the Gas and Power segment, which had a positive  impact on earnings. In February 
2021, Siemens Energy presented measures to improve its competitiveness, which are already 
showing  an impact. For example, purchasing activities were bundled and parts of production 
optimized. In addition, savings have been made in material and personnel costs. With regard to 
personnel costs  in Germany , in mid -September management and employee representatives reached 
a solution by concluding a reconciliation of interests  and a master severance scheme . 
Adjusted EBITA margin be fore Special Items  was also within the adjusted guidance range  at 
2.3%.  Special Items  amounted to €673 million in fiscal year 2021 and mainly comprised 
restructuring and integration costs as well as a small share of one -time costs still associated with 
the carve -out. Adjusted EBITA  almost reached break -even with a loss of €12 million.  In fiscal year 
2020 the loss was still around €1.5 billion , caused by  restructuring and non -recurring costs, 
portfolio -related impairment s and write -downs.  
As expected, Siemens Energy closed fiscal year 2021 with a  net loss of €560 million, due to Special 
Items and losses at SGRE. This was a significant improvement compared to  the prior  year ’s net  loss 
of around €1.9 bill ion. Free Cash Flow pre tax increased by 39.1% to around €1.36 billion.  
  
In light of the favorable development, especially the strong cash flow, the Executive Board and the 
Supervisory Board intend to  propose a dividend  of €0.10 per share to the Annual General Meeting .

This was Siemens Energy's first fiscal year as an independent company. The energy technology 
company was fully spun off from Siemens AG in September 2020 and listed on the Frankfurt Stock 
Exchange on Septe mber 28. As early as December, the company was admitted to the MDax, and on 
March 22, 2021, it also became a member of  Germany's highest share index, the DAX, which at that 
time still consisted of 30 stocks. Siemens Energy employs a total of 91,000 people and operates in 
more than 90 countries. The company focuses on the strategic areas of "low - or zero -emission 
power generation" , "transportation and storage  of energy ," and " reducing  CO 2 emissions and energy 
consumption in industrial processes." An estimate d one -sixth of the world's power generation is 
based on technologies from Siemens Energy.  
 
Solid fourth quarter with high order s and strong cash flow  
 
In Q4, Siemens Energy benefited from high order s, which increased by 30.2% to €9.1 billion year-
over-year, due to several large orders in both segments. In addition to the SuedLink grid expansion 
project, which will transport electricity generated by wind power from the North Sea to southern 
Germany, Si emens Energy won an order for the Sun Ba combined -cycle gas turbine power plant in 
Taiwan. The plant, with an installed electrical capacity of 1,100 megawatts, will be an important 
building block in Taiwan's energy transition, which aims to switch from coa l and nuclear power to 
more environmentally friendly gas -fired power plants and renewable energies.  
For both segments, Q4 was the strongest quarter in fiscal year 2021 in terms of revenue , with 
Siemens Energy's revenue increasing by 7.4% to €8.2 billion. T he Gas and Power segment achieved 
considerable growth, while SGRE kept up the strong level of Q4 in the previous year . The service 
business also proved to be resilient  and profitable  in the past fiscal year  and contribut ed to revenue.  
Adjusted EBITA before Special Items  at Siemens Energy was negative at €46 million. Th is was 
mainly due to a loss at  SGRE, which could not be offset despite a strong operating improvement at 
Gas and Power. The past quarter was negatively impacted by Special  Items of €281 million, mainly 
due to the measures taken to enhance competitiveness at Gas and Power. Accordingly, Siemens 
Energy's Adjusted EBITA  was negative at €327 million, compared with a loss of €332 million in the  
same quarter a year earlier.   
The net loss in the fourth quarter decreased only slightly by 1.9% compared to the prior -year ’s 
quarter to minus  €383 million. This was caused by negative earnings development at SGRE due to 
project burdens in the onshore business  and start -up costs in a production area for offshore 
platforms. On the other hand,  Free Cash Flow pre tax improved  sharply , rising by almost 40% year -
over-year to €985 mil lion, benefiting from early project payables  and successes in asset 
management.

Maria Ferraro, CFO of Siemens Energy AG: " Our results today demonstrate our strategy for Gas and 
Power segment announced last year at our Capital Market Day is paying off. We h ave achieved 
significant improvements in operating profit and ended our first full year as a company with 
extremely strong cash flow. Although we still have a lot of work to do to achieve our mid -term 
goals, with the steps we have taken this year, we are w ell on our way. ” 
 
Outlook for fiscal year 2022

2.3%).  Siemens Energy expects  a sharp improvement towards their  target of positive net income 
(Actual figure FY 2021: net loss of €560m). Free Cash Flow pre tax is expected to be in a range of a 
positive mid -triple -digit million € (Actual figure FY 2021: €1,358m ).  
For the GP segment  in fiscal year 2022, a comparable revenue growth to be in a range of 1% to 5% 
(Actual figure FY 2021: 4.1%) is expected and Adjusted EBITA margin before special items is 
expected to be between 4.5% and 6.5% (Actual figure FY 2021: 4. 6%).  
For the SGRE segment , in fiscal year 2022 a comparable decline of revenue between negative  
2% and negative 7%  is expected  (Actual figure FY 2021: growth of 9.0%). Adjusted EBITA margin 
before special items is expected to be in a range of 1% to 4% (Actual figure FY 2021: negative 
1.0%).

Siemens Energy AG: Siemens Energy comments on media reports

Disclosure of an inside information acc. to Article 17 MAR of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014,
transmitted by EQS News - a service of EQS Group AG.

In light of recent media reports regarding talks with the German government, Siemens Energy AG
states the following: Siemens Energy ﬁnancial results for ﬁscal year 2023 are expected to be fully in
line with guidance. The former Gas and Power businesses are expected to continue their excellent
performance in ﬁscal year 2024 and are on track to achieve their mid-term targets (ﬁscal year 2025).
The wind business Siemens Gamesa is working through the quality issues and is addressing the
offshore ramp up challenges as announced in the third quarter communication for ﬁscal year 2023. As
Siemens Gamesa is for the time being not concluding new contracts for certain onshore platforms and
is applying strict selectivity in the offshore business, order intake and revenue are expected to be
lower than market expectations for ﬁscal year 2024, and net losses and cash outﬂow are expected to
be higher than market forecasts.
 
The strong growth in order intake, particularly in the former Gas and Power business areas, leads to a
rising need of guarantees for long-term projects. Considering this requirement, the Executive Board is
evaluating various measures to strengthen the balance sheet of Siemens Energy and is in preliminary
talks with different stakeholders, including banking partners and the German government, to ensure
access to an increasing volume of guarantees necessary to facilitate the anticipated strong growth.
 
Siemens Energy’s budgeting process is still ongoing and no decisions in respect to the annual budget
2024 and/or any speciﬁc ﬁnancing measures have yet been taken by the Executive Board. 
 
Explanations of ﬁnancial measures used can be found in the Annual Report 2022 of Siemens Energy
AG (available at ), in particular in Section 2.2.
 
Siemens Energy AG is also guarantor for the mandatory convertible bond with ISIN DE000A3K81W7
und the bonds with ISIN XS2601458602 and XS2601459162.

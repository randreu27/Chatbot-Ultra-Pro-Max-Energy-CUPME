gridWe connect gridsOur market -leading Transmission Division plays avital role inanenergy landscape which is
characterized byincreasing energy demand, decentralization, decarbonization, and digitalization .
These four challenges aredriven bytheneed toachieve society's netzero ambitions, affordably and
without impacting security ofsupply .
This need requires anincrease inrenewable generation ,expansion andincreased interconnection of
thegrid,andgradual replacement andupgrade ofaging gridinfrastructure .With ourinnovative portfolio
weprovide highest performance (efficiency, reliability, safety) inthistransforming energy landscape .
Together with ourglobally recognised engineering excellence, weareuniquely positioned tobethe
trusted partner ofchoice forcustomers worldwide .
What does Transmission offer?
We make energy greener –Our BLUE portfolio
We build the wind power lines for green electricityBlue gas insulated switchgear (8VN1) 
Due totheincreasing importance ofrenewable energies, the
transmission grid capacities from
northern tosouthern Germany must bemassively expanded .
With thethree grid expansion projects Ultranet, SuedOstLink
andSuedLink ,wearecontributing tooneofEurope's largest
and most powerful energy infrastructure systems,
with the aim ofsuccessfully driving forward the energy
transition inGermany .
Our HVDC transmission solution ishelping toeliminate
imbalances between power generation from northern onshore
andoffshore installations andenergy consumption inwestern
andsouthern Germany .
The transmission capacity ofUltranet, SuedOstLink and
SuedLink willbe6GWintotal, comprising HVDC systems with
state -of-the-artvoltage -sourced converter (VSC) technology
being able tosupply more than 6million households with
renewable energy .

possible tomodernize andexpand theexisting power grids atthe
highest level ofsafety andtosimultaneously reduce ourecological
footprint toanenormous extent without having tocompromise on
performance andeconomic feasibility .Thecombination ofvacuum
switching technology and clean airinsulation reduces emissions
while greatly increasing therecycling rate–virtually maintenance

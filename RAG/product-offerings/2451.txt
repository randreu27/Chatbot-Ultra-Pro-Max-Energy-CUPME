pressurized air-cooled  
generator series
for gas and steam power applications  
from 370–560 MVA
SGen-2000P© 2021 Siemens Energy Page 2The innovative SGen-2000P series combines proven 
Siemens Energy technologies and is an ideal fit for your 
requirements in flexible or base load power plant 
operation. Our modular “building block” approach allows 
Siemens Energy generators to share many features  
and components across the portfolio making them even 
more reliable, efficient and easy-to-maintain. The 
SGen-2000P series is an excellent solution for high- 
power applications as well as synchronous condensing 
applications where grid stability is needed.Key Benefits
• Hydrogen eliminated
• Low CAPEX, low OPEX
• Proven technology
• High operational 
 flexibility

1 Stator: Fleet-proven design of water- cooled stator 
bars with hollow stainless steel conductors
2 Static excitation: integral to the rotor shaft, without 
extra bearing or coup ling interface
3 Stator Frame:  Robust design with simplified plant 
interfaces
 4 Access points: multiple locations for easy 
 maintenance 5 Coolers:  ﬂexible based on operational needs; fully 
integrated into generator base
 6 Rotor:  10,000 start / stop cycles without rotor removal 
during operational life cycle 
 7 Simple ventilation: up to 1 bar (gauge) for extended 
capability and performance optimization
SGen-2000P© 2021 Siemens Energy Page 3Plug & Play installation:
• Easy on-site assembly
• Footprint requires minimal space
• Simple foundation interface
High operational flexibility:
• Efficiency level comparable to traditional hydrogen-  
cooled generators
• Water-cooled stator winding; high cycling capability
• Maximized rotor life through rotor winding temperature 
control
• Simple operation with improved safety and no risk for  
oil contamination (no hydrogen)Easy maintenance:
• Fewer spare parts needed
• Elimination of hydrogen and related equipment in 
 output ranges traditionally reserved for H 2
• Unstaffed operation possible
Gas & Steam Power Generation 
• Flexible integration into combined cycle power plants or 
steam tailing applications.
• Large simple or combined cycle power plants, suitable 
for all duty cycles:
– Peaker applications
– Intermediate or base load applications
– Cogeneration applicationsSynchronous Condenser
• Grid stabilizer for increasing integration of renewable 
power sources into the transmission system
• Ancillary Services to the transmission system:
– Reactive power compensation
– Short circuit power
– Added inertia to the transmission system
– Short term overload capability

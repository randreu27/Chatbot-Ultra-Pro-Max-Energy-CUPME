The importance of Performance Optimization
In the competitive power-generation market, 
power utilities are focused on optimizing 
performance while minimizing operational costs 
to deliver low-cost, high-quality energy to their 
customers.
However, there needs to be a balance in the 
trade-offs between performance, operational 
costs and risks. When it comes to fossil 
generation, performance optimization is directly 
related to operations cost.
Using the data from the DCS for advanced control 
concepts without major changes to mechanical 
equipment is one of the options to increase your 
plants profitability.
With Omnivise Performance you can adapt plant 
operations to your current requirements.Base Load

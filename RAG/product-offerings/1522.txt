This document  contains  statements  related  to our future  business  and financial  performance,  and future  events  or developments  involving  Siemens  Energy  that may

“estimate,”  “will,”  “project,”  or words  of similar  meaning . We may also make  forward -looking  statements  in other  reports,  prospectuses,  in presentations,  in material  
delivered  to shareholders,  and in press  releases . In addition,  our representatives  may from time to time make  oral forward -looking  statements . Such  statements  are 
based  on the current  expectations  and certain  assumptions  of Siemens  Energy’s  management,  of which  many  are beyond  Siemens  Energy’s  control . These  are 
subject  to a number  of risks,  uncertainties,  and other  factors,  including,  but not limited  to, those  described  in disclosures,  in particular  in the chapter  “Report  on 
expected  developments  and associated  material  opportunities  and risks”  in the Annual  Report . Should  one or more  of these  risks or uncertainties  materialize,  should  
acts of force  majeure,  such  as pandemics,  occur,  or should  underlying  expectations  including  future  events  occur  at a later date or not at all, or should  assumptions  
prove  incorrect,  Siemens  Energy’s  actual  results,  performance,  or achievements  may (negatively  or positively)  vary materially  from those  described  explicitly  or 
implicitly  in the relevant  forward -looking  statement . Siemens  Energy  neither  intends,  nor assumes  any obligation,  to update  or revise  these  forward -looking

accordance  with the applicable  financial  reporting  framework  in its consolidated  financial  statements . Other  companies  that report  or describe  similarly  titled

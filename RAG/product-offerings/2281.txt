Gas Field Policy 11:  Low Molecular Weight Application 
 
The following guidelines must be met before a Siemens Energy Compressor can be offered for Lubricated 
Hydrogen or other Low Molecular Weight Applications: 
 
1.  All sizing and performance must be reviewed and approved by Siemens Energy HSRC Group prior to 
quoting. 
 
2.  Maximum discharge pressure limitation is normally  2000 PSIG. Refer any higher pressure applications 
to Siemens Energy HSRC Group for review. 
 3.  Water-cooled cylinders are required where there is end unloading and/or predicted discharge 
temperatures above 225°F. 
 4.  MOS cylinders require a distance piece. HOS and HOSS will require an extra long distance piece. All 
distance pieces must be sealed and purged. 
 5.  All applications must be review ed at stage relief valve setting conditions to ensure they are within 
allowable rod loads. 
 6. Piston rod packing material and piston ring material must be Durawear DW173 material or equivalent. 
 
7.  Compressor cylinder oil may be crankcase oil if it is clean and dry. Otherwise, a separate oil system and 
day tank are required - see co mpressor instruction book. 
 
8.  Compressor valves need to be reviewed by Siemens Energy HSRC and the lift and flow area will likely 
be reduced to promote reliable operation. 
 
9.  No manual unloading systems such as VVCP' s. Acceptable unloading sy stems are FVCP's and 
pneumatically operated valve unloaders. 
 10.  The maximum period that the compressor can be run without a load is 3-5 minutes. 
 
11.  Helium test on compress or cylinders is required. 
 
12.  Actual predicted discharge temperatures should be 275°F or less at normal operating performance 
point. 
 
13.  Special attention should be paid to sealing the process gas system. No fiber gaskets are allowed. 
 14.  HOS and HOSS 26.00-28.00" "clamshell type" cylinder cannot be used.

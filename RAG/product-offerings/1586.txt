Siemens Energy Investor Relations
Dear shareholders,
OnFebruary 7,wepublished Q1fiscal year 2023 results and we
conducted our3rdAnnual Shareholder’s Meeting (AGM) .
During thequarter ,Siemens Energy delivered strong order andrevenue
growth and better than expected cash flow.Astrongly improved
operational performance atGas Services (GS), Grid Technologies (GT),
and Transformation ofIndustry (TI)was, however, more than offset by
charges of€0.5bnatSiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) .
“Our order growth demonstrates that we have the right portfolio to
capitalize onthe energy transition .Notwithstanding the charges at
Siemens Gamesa, Jochen Eickholt and histeam aremaking progress in
improving thesustainability ofthecompany .The delisting ofSiemens
Gamesa willfurther support theteam tofocus onsolving theoperational
problems and theturnaround”, said Christian Bruch .
Orders continued tobevery strong with comparable growth of
49.2%.New orders of€12.7bn,supported bylarge orders especially at
GT, pushed theorder book toarecord value of€98.8bn.Revenues
amounted to€7.1bnand increased by16.0%onacomparable basis .
Allsegments contributed tothisgrowth .
Siemens Energy's profit before special items was minus €282mdue
tocharges atSGRE .These charges reflected the outcome ofan
evaluation oftheinstalled fleet atSGRE, which showed higher than
expected failure rates inspecific components resulting inhigher warranty
andservice maintenance cost assumptions .GSand GTreported sharp
improvements year-over -year and TImanaged the turnaround .
Special items were negative with €103m,mainly driven byrestructuring
costs atSGRE .Asaresult, Profit forSiemens Energy was negative
€384m.Accordingly, Siemens Energy reported aNetloss of€598m.
Corresponding basic earnings pershare (EPS) were negative €0.60.Free
cash flow pretaxwasnegative at€58m.
Weadjusted theoutlook forfiscal 2023 :Management now expects a
Group Profit margin before Special items between 1%and3%andaNet
lossofSiemens Energy Group onprior fiscal year’s reported level.Due to
thebetter than expected cash flow during thequarter, management now
expects Free cash flowpretaxtobepositive .Onthesame day weconducted our Annual Shareholders 'Meeting .
Weopted again forthevirtual format given thatnew legislature provided
uswith the opportunity tohave alive exchange with you, our
shareholders .Alarge number ofyou did take the opportunity to
participate virtually and21shareholders addressed theManaging Board
and Supervisory Board with statements and questions .For more
information, including thevoting results, please seepage 3.
Attheend ofthedaySiemens Gamesa’s shares ceased trading on
the Spanish stock exchanges .Nearly 80%ofSiemens Gamesa’s
minority shareholders accepted ouroffer at€18.05pershare and on
January 25theExtraordinary Shareholders' Meeting ofSiemens Gamesa
decided todelist Siemens Gamesa from thestock exchanges .
Grid Technologies strongly contributed toourorder intake inFY2022 and
yetagain inQ1.Hence, Itake theopportunity towrite about thelargest
offshore grid connection order Siemens Energy ever received onthe
following pages .

Based on our current assumptions, no major negative effects to be expectedFinancial Outlook FY23
Major order for Siemens Energy enables transmission of 
wind power for 4 million people
Infuture, asingle grid connection willtransport uptotwogigawatts
(GW) ofoffshore wind power totheonshore power grid.This ismade
possible byconverter systems provided bySiemens Energy and
Spanish company Dragados Offshore .The German transmission
system operator Amprion hasawarded theworld's firstorder fortwoof
these systems totheconsortium .Intotal, uptofourgigawatts ofgreen
electricity from several offshore wind farms intheGerman North Sea
canbetransported toshore –enough electricity tomeet theneeds of
about four million people .The contract fortheconsortium isworth a
total ofmore than €4billion including maintenance fortenyears .For
Siemens Energy itisthelargest offshore grid connection order the
company hasreceived todate.
Siemens Energy's scope ofsupply consists oftwoconverter platforms
atseaandtwoassociated stations onland.Thewind turbines generate
alternating current and feed itinto theconverter platforms, which
convert thealternating current intoadirect current .Only inthisway
canlarge amounts ofenergy travel thelong distance ofaround 390
kilometers (242miles) each tothetwoconverter stations onland viaa
direct current cable .Theconverter stations onland arebeing built near
Wehrendorf inLower Saxony and Westerkappeln innorthern North
Rhine -Westphalia .
Siemens Energy willmanufacture allmajor high-voltage equipment for
the two connection systems, such asconverter technology,
transformers, and switchgear, inGermany and will assume the
systems’ complete maintenance foraperiod of10years .This includes
services toensure cyber security andtransport logistics, such asthe
provision ofservice ships andhelicopters .
Outlook for the fiscal year 2023
Assumptions forthesegments GS, GTand TIin
respect torevenue growth and Profit margins
before Special items remain unchanged and we
continue toexpect forSiemens Energy comparable
revenue growth (excluding currency translation and
portfolio effects )infiscal year 2023 inarange of3%
to7%(unchanged) .
Due totheaforementioned charges ontheresult,
SGRE’s management nolonger expects SGRE’s
profitability tobeinlinewith itsbusiness plan for
fiscal year 2023 .Accordingly, wehadtoadjust our
outlook forSiemens Energy forfiscal year 2023 .
We now expect Siemens Energy Group’s Profit
margin before Special items between 1%and 3%
(previously inarange of2%to4%)and, accordingly,
Netloss ofSiemens Energy Group tobeonprior
fiscal year’s reported level (previously asharp
reduction ofNetlosscompared tofiscal year 2022 ).Due tothe better than expected cash flow
development during thequarter, wenow expect
Free cash flow pretaxforfiscal year 2023 tobe
positive (previously inanegative range oflow-tomid-
triple -digitmillion) .
The outlook forSiemens Energy assumes nomajor
negative financial impacts from COVID -19orother
pandemic related events, nofurther deterioration inthe
supply chain and rawmaterial cost environment, and
excludes charges related tolegal and regulatory
matters .

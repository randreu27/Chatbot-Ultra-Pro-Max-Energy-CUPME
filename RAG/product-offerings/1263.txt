 Earnings Release  Q2 FY 202 4 
January  1 to March  31, 2024 
Munich, Germany , May 8,  2024 – Siemens Energy  today announced  its results for the second  quarter of fiscal year 202 4 that ended March  31, 
2024. 
Siemens Energy benefits from positive market environment and delivers 
another solid quarter. Adjusted outlook reflects stronger growth and positive 
cash development.  
“Our strong development in the second quarter underscores the continued strong demand for our technology to power the energy t ransition and 
our success in stabilizing the wind business. We have  raised  our outlook to reflect this positive development. The turnaround of our wind business 
is still our focus. To this end, we are taking steps to reduce complexity and create a more focused business ”, says Christian Bruch, President and 
CEO of Siemens Energy AG.  
• During  the second quarter of the fiscal year, Siemens Energy’s relevant markets and demand for electricity continued to develop  strong ly. 
• As expected, o rders decreased year -over -year from a high level of comparison mainly due to a lower volume of large orders. Growth at Grid 
Technologies and Transformation of Industry could not offset lower orders in the other segments , mainly  Siemens Gamesa . Overall, t he decline  
was 21.8% on a comparable basis (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects)  and orders came in with  €9.5bn. The b ook-to-bill ratio 
(ratio of orders to revenue) was again above 1, driving the  order backlog to a new high of €119bn. 
• Revenue grew by 3.7% on a comparable basis to  €8.3bn with substantial and significant growth  at Grid Technologies and Transformation of 
Industry, respectively . 
• Siemens Energy’s Profit  before special items sharply increased  to €170m (Q2 FY 2023:  €41m) in part benefiting from positive currency effects . 
Special items amounted to  positive €331m (Q 2 FY 2023: positive €23m), driven  by pre-tax gain s from the sale of businesses related to the 
ongoing progress on disposals and accelerated portfolio transformation . As a result , Profit  for Siemens Energy came in at € 501m (Q 2 FY 2023: 
€64m). 
• Siemens Energy reported  a Net income  of €108m (Q 2 FY 2023: Net loss €189m). Corresponding basic earnings per share (EPS) were  positive  
€0.08 (Q2 FY 2023: negative  €0.25). 
• Free cash flow pre tax was positive  with €483m (Q2 FY 2023: negative  €294m). The improvement to prior -year quarter was primarily  due to  
strong cash conversion across all business areas and shifts in timing from Siemens Gamesa . 
• Due to the strong  business performance in the first half -year, Siemens Energy raised  its outlook for fiscal year 2024. Management now expects 
for the Siemens Energy Group a comparable revenue growth between 10% and 12% (previously between 3% and 7%)  and a  Profit margin before 
special items between negative 1% and positive 1% (previously between negative 2% and positive 1%). Free cash flow pre tax is now expected 
to be up to  positive €1.0bn (previously around negative €1.0bn ). The o utlook for Siemens Energy’s Net income remains unchanged at up to 
€1bn.

creases at Siemens Gamesa due to a sharply lower volume from large 
orders and Gas Services primarily  due to a high basis of comparison . 
• Book -to-bill ratio came in at 1.14. Order backlog once again ex-
ceeded the previous record level and rose to  €119bn. 
• Revenue increased moderately . Growth at Transformation of Indus-

ness . 
• Profit before Special items  and the corresponding margin sharply im-
proved  mainly driven by Grid Technologies and Gas Services in part 
benefiting from positive currency effect s.  
• Special items included the pre-tax gain from disposals and acceler-
ated portfolio  transformation . 
• Strong improvement of Free cash flow pre tax with the highest con-
tribution from Gas Services mainly due to development of operating 
net working capital .

of a strong order backlog and continu ed service momentum .

cluded a €1.7bn order in the UK . 
• Book-to-bill ratio came in at 0.38. The  order backlog decreased  to 
€39bn. 
• Revenue declined  moderately  as lower revenue in the onshore and 
service businesses more than offset growth in the offshore area . 
• Profit before Special items again was negative . The increased loss 
year -over -year was mainly volume driven . Profit  continu ed to be  im-
pacted  by project margins burdened by higher planned costs due to 
the known quality issues as well as the increased product costs and 
ramp -up challenges in the offshore area in the prior fiscal year . 
• Special items were positive due to the sale of an investment ac-
counted for using the equity method .

 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements includes items , 
which management does not consider to be indicative of the segments’ 
performance – mainly group management costs (management and cor-
porate functions) and other central items, Treasury activities as well as 
eliminations. Other central items include Siemens  brand fees, corporate 
services  (e.g. management of the Group’s real estate portfolio exc ept 
Siemens Gamesa ), corporate projects, centrally held equity interests 
and other items.

6 Outlook  
Due to the business  performance in the first half -year, we raised  the outlook for the fiscal year 202 4 for Siemens Energy. The new forecast is based 
on adjusted  revenue growth assumptions for all segments  and higher Profit assumptions for G rid Technologies . In the first half of the fiscal year, 
the product and service business es in the Grid Technologies  and Transformation of Industry segments performed better than expected  driven by 
strong market demand. For Siemens Gamesa, we expect a revenue development in the second half o f the fiscal year substantial ly exceeding the 
first half -year , especially driven by the continuous ramp -up in the offshore area . In terms of Free cash flow  pre tax , we expect all segments  to 
exceed original expectations  excluding Siemens Gamesa . This is particularly applicable  for Gas Services and Grid Technologies, which both are to 
experienc e strong cash inflows driven by customer payments related to a continuing orders momentum . 
Therefore, we now expect Siemens Energy  to achieve a comparable revenue growth (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) in a 
range of 10% to 12% (previously between 3% and 7%). Profit margin before special items is now expected between negative 1% and positive 1% 
(previously between negative 2% and positive 1%) . Unchanged , we expect a Net income of up to €1bn including impacts from disposals and the 
acceleration of the portfolio transformation.  Furthermore, we now expect a positive Free cash flow pre tax up to €1.0bn (previously a negative 
Free cash flow pre tax of around €1.0bn ). We now expect proceeds for the whole fiscal year around  positive €3.0bn (previously in a range of 
positive €2.5bn to €3.0bn ) from disposals and the acceleration of the portfolio transformation . 
The outlook for Siemens Energy does not include charges related to legal and regulatory matters.  
Amended o verall assumptions per business area  
• Gas Services  now  assumes  a comparable  revenue  growth  of negative  2% to 0% (previously  negative  4% to 0%) and a Profit  margin  before  
special  items  of 9% to 11%  (unchanged) . 
• Grid Technologies  now plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of 32% to 3 4% (previously 18% to 22% ) and a Profit margin before 
special items between  8% and 10% (previously  between 7% and 9%). 
• Transformation of Industry  now  expect s a comparable  revenue  growth  of 14% to 16%  (previously  8% to 12% ) and a Profit  margin  before  
special  items  of 5% to 7% (unchanged) . 
• Siemens Gamesa  now assumes a comparable revenue growth of 10% to 12% (previously 0% to positive 4%) and a negative Profit before special 
items of around €2bn (unchanged) .

11  The share of full-scale LCAs is calculated based on the business segment structure. One business segment is considered to be one portfolio element. All portfolio elements containing material products have been determined to be relevant for this performance indicator. If full-scale LCAs are available for products of a portfolio element, this portfolio 
element is considered to be covered. The share represents the percentage of covered portfolio elements relative to the total number of relevant portfolio elements.

²¹ Compliance cases include, but are not limited to, cases related to our focus areas of anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, anti-trust, data privacy, export control, and human rights.
²² Numbers for disciplinary sanctions in a fiscal year do not necessarily correspond to cases reported during that period: sanctions are frequently not implemented in the same year in which the case was reported or the investigation – which follows a defined process – was completed. In addition, a single case may result in multiple sanctions, or none at all.
²³ Includes loss of variable and discretionary compensation components, transfer, and suspension, but not the revocation of signatory rights.

²⁹ The turnover rate is calculated as the number of voluntary and involuntary (all other) exits at Siemens Energy during the fiscal year divided by the average number of employees.
³⁰ Includes Germany only.
³¹ Ratio between the average salary of a median employee versus our top-paid person.
³²  Figures relate to Siemens Energy, taking into consideration all employees with active employment contracts and complete data available as of the end of each financial year. An unadjusted pay gap refers to the difference between the earnings of men vs. women (mean male vs. female FTE Total Direct Compensation in € using actual payout values based 
on incentive payout ratios from the previous fiscal year converted to hourly rates) that could arise from differences in a number of factors, for example, job families, geography, relative value of the position, seniority, or gender. An adjusted pay gap refers to the part of this difference between the earnings of men vs. women that is attributable solely to 
gender. The pay gap KPI is expressed as the difference between the mean male pay vs. the mean female pay, divided by the mean male pay. A positive pay gap KPI is one in favor of men, a negative one in favor of women.

March 2023… but all of them have
common themes …… supported by accelerating 
change in boundary conditions 
Electricity production will 
grow faster than GDP
•Increasing electrification of 
industries
•New electrical consumers (data 
centers, e -mobility)
•Sector couplingProduction 
capacity will grow
•Capacity expansion will be 
covered by renewables
•Gas will continue to be a 
backbone of electricity 
production
•Coal will be phased out
Energy efficiency will be a 
competitive criteria across 
industries due to
•Higher cost
•Volatility of supply
•Regional differences Grid investment will rise to 
unprecedented levels
•Sustainable modernization
of an ageing grid
•Ensure grid reliability and 
resiliency of a complex network
•Safely connect an ever -
increasing amount of
renewable energyInflation Reduction Act (IRA) –USA
Green Deal Industrial Plan for a Net Zero Age –EULaw is in place providing planning certainty for the next 10 years, 
implementation policy is being finalized in the coming months; detailed 
tax schemes will be automatically included into the existing US tax 
codes; total volume USD 370 bn
EU is working on an answer to IRA; first details published by EU 
Commission on 1 Feb; to be substantiated in the coming months

2023 -11-15Guarantees for Customer Contracts
6Agreement reached to secure €12bn in guarantees:
•As a key facilitator of the energy transition, Siemens Energy has 
seen significant growth in order intake and therefore requires an 
increasing volume of guarantees 
•German Government has agreed to counter -guarantee €7.5bn of a 
total amount of €12bn of guarantees, of which €11bn are provided 
to Siemens Energy by a consortium of banks. The remaining €1bn 
will be provided by an additional consortium led by Deutsche BankKey facts:
•Issuance of supply & service guarantees to customers is standard 
market practice in the industry
•Guarantees protect customers in case contractual obligations are 
not fulfilled
•Banks, insurance companies and third parties ( e.gKfW, Euler 
Hermes, or EIB) provide guarantees against a fee
•Industry -wide demand for guarantees is rising due to increasing 
investments in the energy transition

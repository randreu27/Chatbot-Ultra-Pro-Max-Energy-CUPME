How to increase transmission system capacity and stability
The increasing demand for energy can only be met when grids can provide sufficient 
transmission capacity. Building new lines is not only expensive, it’s also challenging 
due to changing regulations, public acceptance, and environmental concerns. 
Fixed series capacitor technology provides an alternative solution by increasing the 
transmission capacity of existing lines.
Siemens Energy‘s solution 
for advanced power 
delivery translate into a 
number of solid benefits 
including
• Increases power transfer 
capability
• Reduces line voltage drops
• Limits load-dependent voltage drops
• Influences load flow in parallel 
transmission lines
• Reduces transmission angle 
increasing stability
• Reduces footprint for 
transmission systems
• Cost effective solution
• Reliable and robust design even in 
seismic areasFixed Series

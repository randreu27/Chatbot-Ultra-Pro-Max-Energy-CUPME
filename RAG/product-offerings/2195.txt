 Earnings Release  Q2 FY 202 5 
January 1 to March 31, 202 5 
Munich, Germany , May 8 , 202 5 – Siemens Energy  today announced  its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 202 5 that ended March 31 , 
2025. 
Outlook raised after s trong first half year results , especially in the second 
quarter  – focus on profitable growth  
“The rising demand for electricity led to an exceptionally strong quarter and first half of the fiscal year for our business. The improved outlook 
reflects our confidence in the ongoing market opportunities and our excellent project execution. Even in light  of the uncertain macroeconomic 
factors, our focus remains on profitable growth ”, says Christian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy AG.  
• After the strong start to the fiscal year, Siemens Energy's positive development continued in the recent  quarter. Favorable market trends have 
led to a broad -based increase in demand for our products. In addition, Siemens Energy demonstrated strong  project execution  and operational 
performance in the quarter , to which all segments contributed . Overall, Siemens Energy achieved  one of the strongest quarters ever.  
• Siemens Energy's order s amounted to €14.4 bn. This was 5 2.3% higher than in the prior -year quarter on a comparable ba sis (excluding currency 
translation and portfolio effects). In addition to sharp  growth at Grid Technologies, th e upturn w as primarily due to Gas Services, which recorded 
the highest order s in a quarter to date. Book-to-bill ratio (ratio of order s to revenue) was again strong with  1.45, leading to a new record level 
of €133 bn in the order backlog.  
• Revenue increased double -digit in all segments. Overall, revenue grew  by 20. 7% on a comparable basis to €10.0 bn. 
• Siemens Energy's Profit  before Special items amounted to €9 06m, reflecting a margin of 9.1% . All segments contributed to the increase year -
over -year (Q2 FY 2024: €170 m). Special items were  negative  €291m (Q2  FY 2024: p ositive  €331m)  primarily relating to the sale of the Indian 
wind business . Siemens Energy's Profit  came in at  €615m (Q2  FY 2024: €501 m). 
• Net income was  €501m (Q2  FY 2024: €108m). The corresponding basic earnings per share amounted to € 0.50  (Q2 FY 2024: €0.08 ). 
• Free cash flow pre tax amounted to  €1,390m, sharply  increased compared to the pr ior-year's figure (Q2  FY 2024: €483m). Almost al l segments 
contributed to this  improvement . In addition to the profit  development, th is was primarily due to customer  payments including  reservation fees.  
• Due to the positive  business development , Siemens Energy updates  the outlook for fiscal year 2025. Siemens Energy now expects for the Group 
to achieve comparable revenue growth in fiscal year 2025 in a range of 13% to 15%  and a Profit margin before Special items between 4% and 
6%. Siemens Energy expects  a Net income of up to €1bn excluding assumed positive Special items subsequent to the demerger of the energy 
business from Siemens Limited, India. The outlook for Free cash flow pre tax for the fiscal year 2025 is updated to around €4bn.  
• In April 2025, the government of the USA, among others, announced tariffs on imports from various countries. Siemens Energy i s closely mon-
itoring developments and continuously analysing their potential impact on its net assets, financial position and results of operations. For the 
second half of the fiscal year  2025 , a limited direct impact on Siemens Energy’s Profit of up to a high double -digit million € amount , after 
mitigation  measures, is currently expected .

 • Order s increased by more than half  compared to prior -year quarter , 
due to the considerable growth  at Gas Services and Grid Technolo-
gies. The improvement  was primarily due to the new units  business  
and supported by a substantial rise in the service business . On a g e-
ographic  basis , growth was broad -based. All reporting regions rec-
orded sharp  increases.  
• Book-to-bill ratio was 1. 45. Order backlog once again exceeded the 
previous record level and increased to €133b n. 
• Revenue rose significantly w hile new units  and service  business 
share overall remained unchanged . 
• Profit  before Special items and the corresponding margin were up , 
with all segments improving sharply . This was due to the increased 
volume and corresponding degression effects as well as processing 
of orders with higher margins. In addition, Grid Technologies bene-
fited from  positive timing  effects  of around €100m . 
• Special items  in both fiscal years primarily related to disposals . 
• Development of Free cash flow pre tax was driven by improvements 
in all segments , except for  Transformation of Industry, where Free 
cash flow pre tax was nearly unchanged . In addition to the profit  de-
velopment, this was mainly due to advance payments , reservation 
fees, and early payments from customers .

 • Continued strong customer demand led to order s more than  dou-
bling year-over-year. This was driven by large orders in the new units  
business, although orders in the service business also increased 
sharply . On a g eographic  basis , all reporting regions experienced 
sharp growth . The largest increases came from  Saudi Arabia, Canada 
and Taiwan.  
• Book-to-bill ratio was 2.22. As a result, the order backlog increased 
to €52bn. 
• Significant increase in revenue was mainly due to the service busi-
ness.  
• Profit before Special items rose sharply , and the corresponding mar-
gin was also significantly  higher than in the pr ior year. Main drivers  
were higher volume in the service business and margin quality of the 
processed order backlog.

continued strong operational performance, higher volume including  
corresponding degression effects, and a higher margin o f the pro-
cessed order backlog  year -over -year. In addition, the  quarter was 
positive ly impacted by  timing  effects  of around €100m .

lated to the ramp -up of offshore activities as well as  the quality issues

6 Outlook  
Due to  the positive  business development  in the first half -year and the strong market demand, Siemens Energy  updates  the outlook for fiscal year 
2025. The change in the outlook  is driven by stronger than expected performances at Gas Services, Grid Technologies and Transformation of 
Industry . Regarding Free cash flow pre tax, the higher outlook is particularly attributable to  Gas Services and Grid Technologies, which both expe-
rience strong cash inflows driven by customer payments related to strong  order momentum.  At Siemens Gamesa we continue to w ork on the 
measures to reach break -even in fiscal year 2026. We still expect sales activities for the 5.X onshore turbine to resume during fiscal year 2025 . 
Siemens Energy now expects for the Group  to achieve comparable revenue growth (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) in fiscal 
year 2025 in a range of 1 3% to 1 5% (before  8% and 10%)  and a Profit margin before Special items between 4% and 6% ( before  between 3% and 
5%). Siemens Energy expects a Net income of up to €1bn ( before  around break -even)  excluding assumed positive Special items subsequent to the 
demerger of the energy business from Siemens Limited, India . The outlook for Free cash flow pre tax for the 2025 fiscal year is updated to around  
€4bn ( before  to exceed the original guidance of up to €1bn).  
The outlook for Siemens Energy does not include charges related to any future legal and regulatory matters.  
Amended o verall assumptions per business area  
• Gas Services  assumes  a comparable  revenue  growth  of 11% to 13% (before  7% to 9%) and a Profit  margin  before  Special  items  of 11%  to 13%  
(before  10% to 12%). 
• Grid Technologies  plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of 24% to 26% ( before  23% to 25%) and a Profit margin before Special items 
between  14% and 16% ( before  between 10% and 1 2%). 
• Transformation of Industry  expect s a comparable  revenue  growth  of 13%  to 15%  (before  11% to 13%) and a Profit  margin  before  Special  items  
of 9% to 11%  (before  8% to 10%). 
• Siemens Gamesa  assumes a comparable revenue growth of  0% to 2% (before  negative 9% to negative 5%) and a negative Profit before Special 
items of around  €1.3bn (unchanged) .

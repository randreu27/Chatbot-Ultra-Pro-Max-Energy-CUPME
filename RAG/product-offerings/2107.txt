Product and solutions
We apply electrical engineering solutions together 
with control upgrades that helps customers to cut 
auxiliary power requirements, which combines energy 
savings with a reduced environmental footprint. 
Obsolete drives have high energy consumption. 
Siemens Energy replaces mechanical controllers with 
solutions using frequency converters and swaps 
inefficient drives with energy -saving motors –
irrespective of the original manufacturer, drive 
technology concept or application. Modern frequency 
converters improve plant efficiency and availability..

May 2022Steam Turbine Solution 
for transitioning from Coal to Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)
Benefits1
Let’s assume that a customer in district heating wants to replace fuel source 
from coal to concentrated solar power,
•~ 100% power output from sustainable resources
•~ 100% CO2 free power generation
•< 3 years in ROI  
Scope of work & Implementation
•The transition process starts with a study followed by a customized new 
turbine revamp/footprint solution
•The revamp is recommended to be done during the implementation of a 
new steam generation systemFeatures
•New steam path
•Blading optimized to specific steam conditions of the process
•New turbine/ turbine internals designed for frequent start -ups
•Only minor to none modifications required for the piping and periphery Product Overview 
Suited for all customers who want to transition from coal to solar power 
for their steam generation
Up to 100% CO2 
reduction from 
the process
SST 700 -typically used steam turbine for CSP

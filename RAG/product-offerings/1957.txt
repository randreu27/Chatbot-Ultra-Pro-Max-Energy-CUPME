4.1 Hazard identification and risk assessment  
The identification of hazards, the assessment of the corresponding risks, and the implementation of measures to 
eliminate, control or /  and minimize the safety related risks as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP)  must be 
carried out prior to the commencement of work.  
 
This supports the local unit in its understanding of hazards and risks in the work environment.  A documented 
process m ust be defined for hazard identification and risk assessment. The process takes  into consideration rou-
tine and non -routine activities and situations, Human Factors, changes in processes, equipment, workplaces and 
work environment.  
 
Social conditions, clim ate / natural environment conditions, general work environment conditions (e. g . isolated / 
remote areas) as well as hazards and risks arising from a simultaneous operation or activities of third parties (e. 
g. contractor, customer, business partner) must be considered.  
 
Each local unit must systematically assess the risks from the i dentified hazards of its entire operation. In keeping  
risks as low as reasonably practicable, the hierarchy of controls will be applied prioritizing risk elimination over 
subseq uent means of control:    
 
➢ Elimination – Remove a hazard from the workplace (e. g. through alternative work methods, design im-
provements, change of processes etc.).   
➢ Substitution – Replace a hazard with something less hazardous (e. g. replacement of a che mical known 
to cause cancer with one po sing less harmful).    
➢ Technical Control – Design a solution that controls the hazard at its source (e. g. encasing a noisy ma-
chine with a sound -proof barrier).    
➢ Organizational Control – Develop other work practices t o protect employees from hazards (e. g.  limiting 
the amount of time that employees can work in a noisy area or use system of signs or work procedures, 
barricade tape or other warnings that notify individuals of an approaching hazard).   
➢ Personal Control – Protective clothing or equipment that protects an employee from a hazard (e. g. 
hearing protection for employees and others who work in noisy area).  
 
 
The hazard identification and risk assessment shall be established by a Competent Person who is familiar with 
the hazards and ri sks associated with the work activity, work area and work equipment. The employees contrib-
uting to a hazard identification / risk assessment shall also be familiar with hazards and risks associated with the 
work activity, work area a nd work equipment.  
 
The results of hazards identification and risk assessment including implemented measures of control must be 
documented .

EHTTV – Gimpel Electro-Hydraulic Trip & Throttle Valve (Globe and Offset Bodies) 
Background
SE Gimpel electro-hydraulic trip throttle 
valve (EHTTV) is a microprocessor-
controlled trip throttle valve with a 
selfcontained electro-hydraulic actuator. It 
is designed specifically for emergency 
shutdown and throttling on steam turbines. 
The EHTTV uses the same steam section 
design as traditional Gimpel oil-operated 
valves with the advantage of a new 
electrohydraulic actuator that efficiently 
pumps hydraulic fluid from one side of a 
doubleacting cylinder to the other. Once 
the correct position is reached, the motor 
shuts off; therefore, minimal power is 
required to maintain the actuator position.
Design
The EHTTV is controlled by two major 
components: the actuator (cylinder, 
feedback and electro-hydraulic power 
module) and the control panel. The actuator 
is installed on the valve, while the control 
panel has the flexibility to be mounted 
anywhere on the turbine deck. The EHTTV is 
supplied with color coded cables that 
connect the valve to the control panel.
Pre-programmed software designed into the 
controller allows our factory-trained 
personnel to set the valve operating 
parameters. The standard features supplied 
on the EHTTV include the option to throttle 
open/close, exercise and trip either locally or 
remotely.
In addition, the EHTTV has a CSA Class I 
Division 2 area classification and the steam 
section is built to ASME/ANSI B 16.34 and B 
16.5 standards.
The EHTTV is API 612 compliant. It includes 
online solenoid valve testing and 
replacement.Features  
The EHTTV can be furnished in several body  
styles and flow arrangements and can be  
installed with the valve stem in any 
orientation.  The user also has the flexibility 
to operate the valve locally or remotely.

Workshop Summary
Decarbonization  of Industry

Overview
The workshop, held over the course of one hour, featured insightful presentations and engaging discussions on transforming industry on three levels. An increase of >10% in end -to-
end process efficiency, reaching zero unplanned downtime and autonomous operations and a shift from achieving net zero to net positive .
Participants from various backgrounds came together to share their perspectives and expertise, creating a dynamic and collabo rative learning environment.
Presentations
• Kirsten Roden delivered a compelling presentation on transforming reliability through autonomous operations. Four main  challenge  fields  were  presented : Connectivity  as a 
means  to enable  high quality  data aquisition , Digitalisation  with the need  to build  virtual capabilities  using  digital twins , Automation  to enable  operational sequesnces  without  
human interaction  and Design  of equipment  to allow  for remote and autonomous  operations .
• Mudassir Khan discussed the transformation of enabling net positive instea d of net zero . The Liqiud Wind project was used as an example where CO2 is used as a feedstock for E -
fuel in the maritime sector. It was presented how CO2 can be treated as a feedstock instead of waste product in the productio n of E-Methanol with waste heat recovery. It was 
pointed out that this can be especially beneficial during times when surplus renewable energy supply exeeds the demand of electrolysis.
• Boris Rigault presented on the transofmation of efficiency through electrification of drives. Main points included the extednded downtime and complex start & stop regimes for 
mechanical drives which also produce direct emissions. Converting to electric motors achieves highes efficiency and net zero operation when using renewable electricity.
Discussions
The presentations were followed by a robust discussion session where the challenges  / barreirs  and enablers  / accelerators  where  elaborated . Main take-aways  of the sessions  are:
Efficiency
•Complexity and CAPEX are main barriers
•Scalability  and capacity  increase  in bownfield  
challengingReliability
•Joint incentives or success sharing will be accelerator
•Re-think maintenance and need for redundancy also 
in digital services
•There is trust that technology is future proofSustainability
•Availability of biogenic CO2 and cost of green 
hydrogen are main barriers to large scale adoption
•Policy and regulatory work needed
•Other end -products  such as Ethylene  are interesting

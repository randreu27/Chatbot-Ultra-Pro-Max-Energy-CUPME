GRI 103: Management Approach 2016
Community Engagement is managed locally by representatives in the regions. Furthermore we include 
local stakeholders in projects, like in our mega project in Egypt. Over a period of four years e.g. 5,500 
Egyptian engineers and technicians were trained.GRI 413: Local Communities 2016
Supplier Social Assessment 
GRI 103: Management Approach 2016
100% of suppliers are typically screened in the process of supplier qualification and supplier 
development. We procure from some 30,000 supplier worldwide, it is not possible for us to inspect all 
suppliers to the same extent. We have therefore established a risk-based system to systematically 
identify potential risks in our supply chain. GRI 414: Supplier Social Assessment 2016

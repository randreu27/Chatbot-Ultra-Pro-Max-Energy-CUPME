Gas Field Policy 22:  API 618 Comments & E xceptions, 5th Edition (December, 2007)  
 
Siemens Energy builds compressors in basic compliance with this edition of API-618.  Our experience 
has shown that a few of the requirements do not a dd commensurate life or reliability and therefore the 
following clarifications are indicated.  
SIEMENS ENERGY HOS AND HOSS COMPRESSORS 
 Paragraph                                                                    Comment  
 
6.1.1 The compressors offered are designed and cons tructed for a minimum service life of 20 years.  
They are suitable for continuous full load duty for at least 3 years between major overhauls, and 
should only require replacement of recognized wear  components (rings, valves , packing, oil filters, 
etc.) during this period.  Siemens Energy strongly recommends that normal published maintenance schedules be followed. 
 
6.1.3 Unless specifically stated otherwise, capacity may vary by +/- 3%.  
6.1.6 If required, Siemens Energy can furnish typical or expected noise level data for this equipment.  
These noise levels may not comply with the requirements of API 615. 
 
6.1.18 Unless specifically stated otherwise, horsepower may vary by +/- 3%. 
 6.1.26 Spare/replacement pa rts...to meet (Par. 9.3.6) except Siem ens Energy will not provide specific 
materials of construction (identified by  applicable international standards). 
 6.2.1 Threads on the HOS/HOSS VVCP piston rod ar e 2.5"-3 ACME-3G and do not conform to the 8 
pitch requirement 1.00" and over diameter. 
 6.2.3 Internal socket fasteners can be found on the mu lti-screw tensioners used on piston retainment for 
the HOS and HOSS compressors.  Slotted nut desi gns have successfully been used for piston 
retainment on the HOS of decades.  
 
6.2.5 The piston rod for all Siemens Energy HSRC Pr oducts is not positively locked to the crosshead 
assembly.  HOS conn rod bolts no longer have a "positive" locking mechanism and now rely only on stretch. 
 
6.3.1 On larger bore cylinders, piston rod vertical  run out may exceed the . 00015 in./in. of stroke 
limitation. 
 
6.5.1 The maximum predicted temperature shall not  exceed 300°F (adiabatic) and 350°F (actual).  In 
hydrogen rich service, the maximum predicted te mperature shall not exceed 275°F (adiabatic) and 
300°F (actual). 
 6.8.1.3 Some of the larger cylinder patterns, when placed  side by side, do not allow access to water jacket 
covers.  Some types of unloaders on large cylinde rs placed side by side are difficult to access. 
 6.8.1.5 The overbore allowance is 0.062" over the original diameter on all Siemens Energy HSRC 
Products. 
 6.8.1.6 Although Siemens Energy’s standard for thread ed holes in castings is 1-1/2 times the stud 
diameter, there are a few cases on the HOS and HOSS cylinders which do not meet this criteria.

Paragraph                                                                    Comment  
 
6.8.2.1 Some large cylinders require a cylinder sup port which attaches to the outer head.  On packaged 
units, smaller cylinders are normally supported on ly from the outer end of  the distance piece. 
 6.8.2.2 All cylinders (except billets) will normally be s upplied without liners.  Minimum liner thickness is .25" 
for cylinders up to 9.5" diameter. 
 6.8.2.3 Finish of typical lubricated compressor cylinder bores is 32RMS. 
 
6.8.3.1 HOS and HOSS cylinders with water jacket s are available.  All forms of cooling can be 
accommodated by these cylinder water jackets. 
 
6.8.3.4.1 Refer to 6.8.3.1.  
6.8.4.1.10 HOS and HOSS cylinders utilize an extend ed plug with a hex head to reduce fixed clearances 
within a given cylinder. 
 
6.8.4.1.12 Siemens Energy only supplies mating flange s and gaskets for the 6000# lens type flanges found on 
the H.P. billet cylinders. 
 
6.8.4.1.15 Siemens Energy’s standard  is 90RMS or 100-150 circular fini sh.  All inlet/outlet flanges are ANSI 
standard with the exception of the HOS/HOSS clamshell cylinders. 
 
6.8.4.2.5 Rectangular flange and bolting dimensions for clamshell cylinders can be found on the cylinder 
outline drawings provided to the Resellers.  Ring type joints w ill be found on all 4000 psi billet 
cylinders and lens flanges on the 6000 psi billet cylinders. 
 
6.9.1.3 Siemens Energy valves are not 100% polarized .  The valves are designed with a capscrew that 
protrudes from the valve on the bac k side of the valve to prevent valves from being installed upside 
down.  In the event a valve was installed upside  down, this capscrew would contact the piston 
during barover inspection and prevent crankshaft ro tation alerting operators that the valves are 
installed improperly.  An inlet valve cannot be in stalled into a discharge valve port because the 
nose of the valve is too large in diameter.  Shoul d a discharge valve inadvertently be installed in a 
suction valve hole, the valve will not co mpletely seat, so no damage can occur. 
 
6.9.1.5 On a non-conventional cylinder  such as the DDV series, the valves are placed, by design, in the 
cylinder bore. 
 
6.9.1.6 Siemens Energy provides no such valve installation/removal tool. 
 6.10.2.1 The piston rod is not positively locked to the crosshead on any Siemens Energy HSRC compressor 
design. 
 6.10.3.2 HOS and HOSS cylinders are furnished with combination rings, which act as both the wear band 
and sealing ring.  These assemblies are designed for bearing loads under 15 psig.  Wear bands 
and piston rings, designed for the specified beari ng load limits, are available as an option. 
 
6.10.4.1 HOS and HOSS cylinders will have the piston rod induction hardened in the area of interest.  A 
tungsten carbide coating (TC3) is available for all Siemens Energy HSRC Products. 
 
6.11.3 The HOS relies on achieving the prescribed bolt stretch to keep the joint tight.

Paragraph                                                                    Comment  
 
6.11.4 HOS and HOSS models utilize a box style cr osshead of ASTM A536 Grade 65-45-12.  This 
material offers higher strength, durability and better castability than the cast steel.  HOS 
compressors use integral, non-adjustable shoes as standard.  Replaceable shim adjustable shoe 
crossheads are available for HOS models.  HOSS models have shim adjustable shoes as standard. 
 6.12.2.3 The distance pieces are designed for a maximum pressure of 25 psig.   
 
6.12.2.4 On packaged units, a common vent/drain may be ut ilized at the bottom of the distance piece, if the 
gas is heavier than air.  Vent may be smaller than  the 1-1/2" npt specified.  Packing gland cooling 
connections are inlet at the bottom of the distance piece and outlet at the top to avoid formation of 
air pockets in the packing. 
 
6.12.2.5 External connections may be smaller than the 1" npt specified. 
 6.12.2.7 In addition to the Austenitic stainless steel t ubing and fittings, Siemens Energy may employ a teflon 
flexible hose with stainless steel braid on pressures below 3000 psi. 
 6.13.2.3 The HOS/HOSS uses cooled packings for lubricat ed cylinders with MAWP of 2000 psig or greater 
as standard.  Cooled packings avail able for all cylinders upon request.   
 6.14.2.1.1 For pressurized oil systems,  temperatures up to 180°F are acceptable provided the proper grade of 
oil is being used. 
 6.14.2.1.2 Lubrication system is not built in accordance with API-614. 
 
6.14.2.1.4 j. Standard Siemens Energy relief valves hav e a cast iron body and hardened steel internals.  
                          Any other available combination can be provided at an additional cost. 
 k. HOS and HOSS uses carbon steel upstream of the filter and 300 series stainless tubing with 
  carbon steel fittings downstream.  
6.14.2.1.5 Shell and tube cool ers utilize cast iron bonnets. 
 6.14.2.3 b. Siemens Energy standar d coolers are not TEMA Class C, but these can be supplied for an 
                          additional cost. 
 c. .375 diameter tubes with wall thickness of 22, 24 & 25 BWG and not the 18 BWG as specified. 
 
6.14.2.4 a. All Siemens Energy HSRC Products are 25 micron particle size. 
 6.14.2.6 Standard Siemens Energy relief valves are lo cated outside the crankc ase and have a cast iron 
body with hardened steel internals.  All compressors have their return lines entering the pump 
suction and do not dump back into the crankcase. 
 
6.14.2.7 Siemens Energy does not supply an oil temperature regulator as standard. 
 6.14.3.2.2 a. A resettable spring-loaded indicator pin for ea ch outlet is not standard but is available.  Instead, 
  Siemens Energy supplies a cycle pin indicator on the distribution block which indicates proper  
  cycling.  d. A cycle monitor is not provided.

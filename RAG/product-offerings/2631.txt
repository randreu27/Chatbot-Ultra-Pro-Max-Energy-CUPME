1.General specification
The WEPS-Series is divided into three (3) main 
designs where the main difference is the design 
of the probe:
•Pressure sensin g element at tip of the 
probe
•Oil filled system with retracted  Pressure 
Sensing Element
•Oil filled system with retracted  Pressure 
Sensing Element and  extended housing
For each of the two types, a range of 
mechanical and el ectrical interfaces are 
available in various pressure and  temperature 
ranges. 
Three main designs
•Standard Accuracy
Standard Pressure
Standard Temperature
•High Accuracy
High Pressure

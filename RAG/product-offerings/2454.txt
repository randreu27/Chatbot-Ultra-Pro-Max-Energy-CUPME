   Combustion
    Dry-Low-NO X hybrid burners, for low emission 
operation with gaseous and liquid fuels
  Homogeneous combustor outlet profile for mini-
mized mechanical and thermal turbine stress
  Annular walk-in combustion chamber with 
individually replaceable heat shields for easy 
maintenance and short outages, resulting in 
highest availability   Bearings 
   Hydraulic Clearance Optimization (HCO) 
improves performance and minimizes 
degradation by active control of clearances  
at start-up and shut down   Turbine
    High cycling capability due to fully 
air-cooled hot gas path without 
cooling air coolers
  Four stages with film cooling and 
thermal barrier coatings: Well-
balanced turbine load optimizes 
life-cycle costs

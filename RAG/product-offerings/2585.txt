3EQUIPMENT
The following equipment will be required to complete this installation:
Calibrated 16 mm spigot torque wrench Part No. NOR-13019 (15 to 80 lbf ft) (or equivalent)
3/4” A/F open end fitting Part No. NOR-29709 (or equivalent)
5 mm Allen Key
4GENERAL SAFETY INFORMATION AND RISKS
1.For full Safety and Hazard information, please consult the ElecTRON IOM or Safety Data Sheet for the
test media in use.
Warning. Risk of minor personal injury to persons with sensitivities to mineral based oils.
Wear appropriate hand protection when handling products or mineral or synthetic based oils.
Warning. Risk of minor personal injury and/or material or environmental damage during assembly.
Caution shall be exercised during assembly to ensure that fittings and hydraulic/pneumatic
equipment are correctly installed.
Warning. Risk of bodily injury caused by pressure retaining parts becoming projectile due to user
over-pressurising the system.
Warning. Hydraulic injection risk. Only to be used to MAWP with oil and suitable pump in lines with
Pressure Equipment (Safety ) Regulations (2016) or relevant local alternative where used abroad.
5PREPARATION
1.Visually inspect the adaptor assembly, ensure there is no damage to the sealing cone, threads, or body
of the adaptor. If there is any doubt over the integrity of the adaptor, stop work immediately and
contact the Siemens Energy Technical Department.

Restricted6PROCESS
1.Refer to the relevant assembly/installation procedure and connector/scope drawing for the test
pressure to be used and location of the test port.
2.Loosely fit the test adaptor being used to the connector under test.
3.For the TC6A-349, tighten the grub screw hand tight only (4 Nm) using a 5 mm Allen key to take up
any slack in the connection.
4.Tighten the test fixture to 5 to 10 Nm using torque wrench NOR-13019 and ¾” adaptor NOR-29709.
5.Perform pressure test in accordance with relevant assembly/installation procedure.
6.Relieve system pressure down to ambient.
7.Remove test adaptor from connector under test and clean up any residual oil on the connector and
adaptor.

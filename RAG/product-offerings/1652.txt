(Applicable for all SST800/ SST600/ SST500/ SST400/ 
SST300/ SST200/ legacy fleet)
Benefits
•~50% reduction in steam leakage
•CO2 savings result from the reduction in fuel consumption due to 
prevention of steam leakage.
•Increased wear resistance -Brush bristles are inclined by 45 degrees and 
are free from wear and regain their original radial clearance. With 
conventional seal -points, rubbing causes lasting clearance expansion and 
decline of efficiency
Scope of work & Implementation
The work should ideally be performed as part of a major overhaul when the 
rotor and the labyrinth gland are at the service center for inspection,
•The rotor surface must be turned smoothly in the area of the brushes
•The notches are prepared in the labyrinth gland and the corresponding 
number of brushes are usedImproved Features
•According to the differential pressure up to four brush elements per 
balance piston are arranged in square notches of the labyrinth glands
•The gap with conventional seal points is 0.6 -0.8 mm. By using the brush 
seals the gap between brush and rotor flange facing is reduced to 0.05 
mmProduct Overview 
Brush seals help prevent steam leakage by closing the small, permanent 
gap between the labyrinth gland and the rotor.

 Earnings Release Q3 FY 2021 | Siemens Energy
1
Munich, Germany, August 4, 2021 – Siemens Energy today announced its results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 that ended June 30, 2021.
Siemens Energy – Gas and Power segment on track, 
SGRE impacted by onshore wind business
Christian Bruch, President and Chief Executive Officer of Siemens Energy AG, said „Our activities at Gas and Power are fully on track and the segment 
delivered as planned. At the same time, we are not satisfied with the performance of SGRE which suffered a significant setback in the turnaround 
of the onshore business. This does not change the attractive market fundamentals for Siemens Energy, however due to the headwinds at SGRE we 
do not expect to reach the low end of the group margin guidance for the full year.”
•Strong order development at Gas and Power (GP). Due to the expected volatile order development at Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) 
orders dropped by 36.8% to €5.9bn against a strong order intake in Q3 FY 2020. Order backlog at quarter-end amounted to €82.6bn.
•Revenue increased by 8.8% to €7.3bn due to growth in both segments for a book-to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) below 1. On a compa-
rable basis (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) revenue grew 11.2% versus prior-year’s level.
•Driven by GP’s sharp improvement, Adjusted EBITA before special items for Siemens Energy was positive with €54m (Q3 FY 2020: negative 
€213m) and a margin of 0.7%, despite a loss at SGRE. The recent quarter was impacted by total special items of €178m particularly related to 
GP’s competitiveness program. Special items in Q3 FY 2020 however were negative €969m, mainly resulting from strategic portfolio decisions. 
Overall, Adjusted EBITA came in with negative €124m compared to negative €1,182m a year earlier.
•Net loss was €307m, a sharp improvement compared to the loss in the prior-year quarter of €1,132m. Corresponding basic earnings per share 
(EPS) were negative €0.32.
•For fiscal year 2021, management confirms the outlook for nominal revenue growth in the range of 3% to 8% for Siemens Energy. However, due 
to the financial performance at SGRE’s onshore business in the recent quarter and its significantly lower profit expectations for the fiscal year 
2021, management now expects an Adjusted EBITA margin before special items for Siemens Energy in the range of 2% to below 3%, previously 
3% to 5%.Earnings Release

Free cash flow pre tax 328 432 (24.0)%•Orders were substantially down due to a sharp decrease at SGRE
against a strong Q3 FY 2020 driven by large orders in SGRE’s offshore
activities, which more than offset the clear increase at GP.
•Revenue was clearly up on a reported basis. Significant growth at
SGRE was accompanied by a clear increase at GP. Excluding currency
translation and portfolio effects, development of total revenue
growth was 11.2%.
•Service revenue came in clearly above the prior-year quarter.
•Book-to-bill ratio decreased to 0.82, mainly driven by SGRE. Order
backlog was €82.6bn, below prior quarter’s level.
•Adjusted EBITA increased sharply. This was primarily driven by lower
burdens from special items. In addition, GP showed strong opera-
tional improvements compared to the prior-year quarter.
•Special items sharply decreased as Q3 FY 2020 was negatively im-
pacted by strategic portfolio decisions, mainly related to the stream-
lining of GP’s aero derivative gas turbine offerings and SGRE’s restruc-
turing plan in India.
•Adjusted EBITA before special items and corresponding margin of Sie-
mens Energy improved year-over-year but were held back by a loss at
SGRE.
•Net loss and corresponding negative basic EPS decreased sharply
compared to prior-year quarter. Net loss of the recent quarter com-
prised €77m income tax expenses which were impacted by the non-
recognition of deferred tax assets at SGRE.
•Free cash flow pre tax decreased substantially driven by the decline
at SGRE compared with a sharp increase at GP.
•During the quarter, provisions for pensions and similar obligations
decreased from €906m as of March 31, 2021 to €867m as of June
30, 2021.

Free cash flow pre tax 384 27 >200%•Orders in the GP segment were clearly up compared to prior-year
quarter. The increase was predominantly in the EMEA reporting re-
gion (Europe, Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa, Middle
East). Orders in Germany more than doubled supported by two large
orders at Transmission totaling more than €450m. Transmission and
Industrial Applications contributed to the growth.
•Revenue was clearly up compared to prior-year quarter, with all busi-
nesses posting increases and an especially strong improvement at
Transmission.
•Service revenue moderately increased year-over-year negatively im-
pacted by currency translation and portfolio effects of more than
four percentage points.
•Book-to-bill ratio of GP came in almost at 1, resulting in an order
backlog at quarter-end of €50.1bn, flat to prior quarter-end’s level.
•Adjusted EBITA and corresponding margin were sharply improved
compared to prior-year quarter driven by sharply lower negative spe-
cial items and also supported by operational improvements across
the businesses.
•Impacts from special items decreased compared to prior-year quarter
which included €701m related to aeroderivative gas turbines (re-
ported under strategic portfolio decisions). Recent quarter com-
prised restructuring costs of €95m, mainly related to the execution
of GP’s competitiveness program.
•Adjusted EBITA before special items and corresponding margin
sharply increased year-over-year.
•Free cash flow pre tax was sharply above prior-year quarter’s level
mainly due to the improved result.
•Further special items, predominantly restructuring costs relating to
the execution of the competitiveness program, are expected in the
fourth quarter.

Free cash flow pre tax (35) 278 n/a•Orders sharply declined in comparison to an especially strong prior-
year quarter due to a sharply reduced volume from large orders and
reflects expected volatility in the offshore market. Q3 FY 2020 in-
cluded very large orders, which comprised among others, large or-
ders for offshore wind farms including service in the Netherlands and
France.
•The significant revenue increase was supported by growth of the on-
shore and service businesses.
•Book-to-bill ratio of SGRE came in at 0.56, leading to an order backlog
of €32.6bn.
•Adjusted EBITA was affected by provisions for onerous contracts of
€229m due to the impact of raw material price increases and higher
than expected ramp-up costs for the SGRE 5.X platform. Both factors
have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially re-
garding projects in Brazil for delivery in FY 2022 and FY 2023. Q3 FY
2020 was negatively affected by project delays and the slow-down
of the Indian market as well as charges with regard to a restructuring
plan for India (reported as special items).
•Adjusted EBITA before special items and the corresponding margin
improved compared to prior-year quarter.
•Free cash flow pre tax with a sharp reduction compared to Q3
FY 2020 benefitting particularly from higher project-related cash in-
flows.

5Outlook
We confirm GP segment’s outlook. However, due to the business development of SGRE’s onshore activities in the recent quarter and its significantly
lower profit expectations for the fiscal year 2021, we amend the outlook for Siemens Energy and the SGRE segment.
We now assume Adjusted EBITA margin before special items for Siemens Energy  in fiscal year 2021 not to reach the low end of the original
guidance of 3% to 5%. It is now expected we achieve a margin in the range of 2% to below 3%. Unchanged, we expect the nominal revenue growth
rate to be in the range of 3% to 8% and a sharp increase in Net income and a sharp decrease of Free cash flow pre tax.
Unchanged, for the GP segment  in fiscal year 2021 we expect the nominal revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 6% and Adjusted EBITA
margin before special items to be between 3.5% and 5.5%.
For the SGRE segment  we now expect nominal revenue growth at the low end of the range of 8% to 11%. Adjusted EBITA margin before special
items is now expected to be in a range of negative 1% to 0% (previously 3% to 5%) in fiscal year 2021.
This guidance continues to assume limited financial impact from COVID-19 for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 and excludes charges related to
legal and regulatory matters.

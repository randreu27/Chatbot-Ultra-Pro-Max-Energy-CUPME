With the footprint solution, the turbine and all its components 
are modernized but their dimensions and the positioning of 
the flanges are not changed, with the result that they can be 
perfectly integrated into the existing infrastructure. 
In the process, it’s possible to determine exactly which turbine 
components should be reworked to improve efficiency or 
performance.

Flexibility
Efficiency Power
• Minimal training requirements 
because personnel continue to  
work with the known system
• Minimal service interruption because 
the entire turbine is replaced instead 
of repairing/ modernizing individual 
components
• No problems with adapting to 
existing piping and foundation
The footprint concept permits an 
eventual adaptation to future system 
requirements in terms of flexibility
Improved energy efficiency thanks to 
state-of-the-art  technology, e.g. 
blades, nozzle and guide ring• Turbine tailored to individual

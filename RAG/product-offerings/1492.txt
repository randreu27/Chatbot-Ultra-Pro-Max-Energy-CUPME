Munich, May 5, 202 1 – Siemens Energy today announced its results for the second  quarter of fiscal 2021  that ended March  31, 202 1. 
Siemens Energy with solid  operational performance 
and strong order intake   
Christian Bruch, President and Chief Executive Officer of Siemens Energy AG, said „ I am  pleased with our solid second quarter results and that we 
are on track to reach our targets  for the fiscal year despite a challenging environment. Our strong order  intake  prove s our competitiveness especially 
of our sustainable portfolio elements. ” 
 
• Orders  rose by 39.0 % to  €10.5 bn, s ubstantially  above the prior -year quarter, driven by Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE).  
• Revenue moderately decreased by 4.4% to €6.5bn. On a comparable basis (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) revenue was on 
prior -year’s level . 
• Book -to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) was at 1.62 , lifting order backlog to € 84.2 bn. 
• Adjusted EBITA was € 197m, sharply up from €88m in the prior -year quarter  which  was negatively  impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic and 
project related matters, predominantly at SGRE . The recent quarter showed a solid performance with an improved operational profitability. With 
special items totaling negative € 91m, Adjusted EBITA before special items sharply increased to € 288m with a margin of  4.4%. 
• Net income was € 31m up sharply  after a loss in the prior -year quarter. Corresponding basic earnings per share (EPS) rose to € 0.03 . 
• For fiscal year 2021, m anagement confirms the profitability outlook  of 3% to 5% for the Adjusted EBITA margin before special items, while 
narrowing the range of expected revenue growth for Siemens Energy overall and both segments individually . For Siemens Energy, the nominal 
revenue growth rate in fiscal year 2021 now is expected to be in a range of 3% to 8% , previously 2% to 12%.  Earnings Release

 • Orders were substantially  up driven by growth at SGRE, which more 
than offset the clear decrease at Gas and Power (GP).  
• Revenue was moderately down on a reported basis. While SGRE 
achieved a clear increase, GP posted a clear decline. Excluding cur-
rency translation and portfolio effects, total revenue w as in line  with 
the prior -year quarter.  
• Service revenue came in moderately below the prior -year quarter, as 
the clear  increase at SGRE was more th an offset by a de crease at GP.  
• Book -to-bill ratio was especially strong at 1.62. Order backlog rose to 
€84.2 bn. 
• Adjusted EBITA increased sharply and was primarily driven by SGRE. 
GP’s profitability exceeded  the strong prior -year quarter’s level, its 
Adjusted EBITA was nearly level year -over-year.  
• Special items significantly  decreased compared to prior -year quarter. 
A sharp increase of restructuring and integration costs was more 
than offset by a positive effect related to  strategic portfolio decisions.  
• Adjusted EBITA margin before special items of Siemens Energy im-
proved year -over-year.  
• Net income and corresponding b asic EPS rose sharply . 
• Free cash flow pre tax was well back in a positive range as both seg-
ments showed sharp improvements year -over-year.  
• During the quarter, provisions for pensions and similar obligations 
decreased from €1,026m as of December 31, 2020 to € 906m as of 
March 31, 2021  mainly due to higher discount rate assumptions.

quarter. The decline was predominantly  in the EMEA reporting re-
gion (Europe, Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle 
East and Afric a). On a comparable basis, orders at GP declined by 
1.8%. The order development was supported by growth at Transmis-
sion.  
• Revenue was clearly down compared to the strong prior -year quarter , 
mainly  due to negative currency translation effects and the lower or-
der intake in previous quarters . 
• Service revenue also clearly decreased year -over-year but less than 
revenue overall . 
• Book -to-bill ratio of GP continued to be on a strong level with 1.21, 
resulting in an order backlog at quarter -end of €50.5bn, well abov e 
prior quarter -end.  
• Adjusted EBITA was nearly on prior -year quarter’s level held back by 
lower revenue. Both quarters benefited from net positive one -time 
effects from projects and other items. Recent quarter included major 
effects in connection with a cu stomer settlement and with a project 
termination. Adjusted EBITA margin was above prior -year quarter’s 
level supported by operational improvements.  
• The impacts from special items decreased compared to prior -year 
quarter as higher restructuring costs were m ore than offset by a pos-
itive one -time effect related to aeroderivative gas turbines  written -
off in the prior fiscal year (reported under strategic portfolio deci-
sions).  
• Adjusted EBITA margin before special items increased year -over-year.  
• Free cash flow pr e tax was sharply above prior -year quarter’s level 
mainly due to higher  project -related cash inflows.  
• Execution of the competitiveness program continues to support Sie-
mens Energy’s transformation, which is expected to have impacts on 
Adjusted EBITA in the second half predominantly reported within 
special items.

Free cash flow pre tax   (32)   (326)   (90.1)%  • Orders rose sharply in comparison to Q2 FY 2020 as a result of large 
orders. The increase was predominant in  the EMEA reporting region, 
where orders nearly quadrupled year -over-year, including three large 
orders worth approximately €2.8bn for offshore wind farms includ-
ing service in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and France. Or-
der intake in the recent quart er and the trend year -over-year reflects 
the volatility of the offshore market, which affected order intake not 
only for wind turbines but also in service . 
• The clear revenue increase was broad -based with the service busi-
ness contributing the highest percentage growth.  
• Book -to-bill ratio of SGRE was especially strong at 2.35, increasing 
order backlog to €33.7bn.  
• Adjusted EBITA was back in a positive range compared to prior -year 
quarter. Q2 FY 2020 was impacted by negative effects related to  the 
COVID -19 pandemic,  the slowdown in the India n market and execu-
tion challenges in the Northern European projects.  The profitability 
was supported by a solid operational performance in the WTG (Wind 
Turbine Generator) and the service businesses and a reassessment o f 
the marketability of inventories . 
• Adjusted EBITA before special items and the corresponding margin 
rose sharply.  
• Free cash flow pre tax improved sharply year -over -year mainly sup-
ported by stringent asset management.

5 Outlook
Against the background of the business development in the first half  of the fiscal year coupled with greater visibility on the remainder of the fiscal 
year, we refine  our ou tlook for the nominal revenue growth  for Siemens Energy and both segments . Our original outlook included a wider range 
for the expected growth rate reflecting a high level of uncertainty at that time regarding factors , amongst others, the global COVID -19 p andemic.  
We now  expect the nominal revenue growth rate for Siemens Energy  in fiscal year 2021 to be in the range of 3% to 8% (previously 2% to 12%). 
Unchanged, we expect an Adj usted  EBITA margin before special items of 3%  to 5%, a sharp increase in Net incom e and a sharp decrease of Free 
cash flow pre  tax. 
For our GP segment  in fiscal year 2021  we now expect nominal revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 6% (previously 2% to 11%) . Adjusted  
EBITA marg in before special items is anticipated  unchanged be tween  3.5% and 5.5%.  
For o ur SGRE segment  we now expect nominal revenue growth in the range  of 8% to 1 1% (previously 8% to 18%) . Adjusted EBITA margin before 
special items is expected to be unchanged in a range of 3% to 5% in fiscal year 2021.  
We continue to expect global macroeconomic development to remain subdued for the remaining fiscal year 2021, with risks particularly related to 
geopolitical and geoeconomic uncertainties. Our markets tend to have  a limited effect to economic cycles and our businesses , especially our service 
business , is characterized by a high level of resilience.  
This guidance continues to assume limited  financial impact from C OVID -19 during fiscal year 2021. Nevertheless, we obs erve with concern the 
resurgence of the global C OVID -19 pandemic and measures imposed by authorities.  We continue to monitor the pandemic situation and evaluate 
appropriate measures as it pertains to our guidance.   
This outlook excludes charges related to legal and regulatory matters.

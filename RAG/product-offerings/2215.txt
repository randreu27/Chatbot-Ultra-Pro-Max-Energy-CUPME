M7 PAI 7. Activities negatively affecting biodiversity-sensitive areas No significant environmental incidences concerning negative effects on 
biodiversity-sensitive areas have been reported in fiscal year 2023.
Effects on biodiversity-sensitive areas are not material for Siemens energy, 
however, we are continuously working towards increasing data transparency 
on biodiversity related indicators.
M8 PAI 8. Emissions to water We strive to adhere to local laws and regulations related to emissions to 
water.
Emissions to water are not material for Siemens Energy, however we are 
continuously working towards increasing data transparency.

¹  Includes category “use of sold products” only (well-to-tank emissions are included, biogenic emissions have been excluded). Siemens Gamesaʼs emissions equal zero. Fiscal year 2022 emissions were recalculated to reflect the reduction of the expected lifetime for gas and steam turbines in power generation from 30 years to 28 years 
and an H2 co-firing project in fiscal year 2022.
²  Includes categories “purchased goods and services“ and “transportation and distribution” only. 2022 data was adjusted to include Siemens Gamesa. Due to the partially undefined material codes of the purchasing volume at Siemens Gamesa, approximately 10% of the CO2e emissions were extrapolated. In fiscal year 2023, 325 kilotons 
of the 9,230 kilotons CO2e emissions were calculated using a consumption-based method.
³  Figures relate to Siemens Energy using a new methodology to calculate the fiscal year 2023 figures. An unadjusted pay gap refers to the difference between the earnings of men vs. women (mean male vs. female FTE Total Direct Compensation in € using actual payout values based on incentive payout ratios from the previous fiscal 
year converted to hourly rates) that could arise from differences in a number of factors, for example, job families, geography, relative value of the position, seniority, or gender. An adjusted pay gap refers to the part of this difference between the earnings of men vs. women that is attributable solely to gender. The pay gap KPI is 
expressed as the difference between the mean male pay vs. the mean female pay, divided by the mean male pay. A positive pay gap KPI is one in favor of men, a negative in favor of women. 
Fiscal year 2022 figures relate to Siemens Energy (excluding Siemens Gamesa). For fiscal year 2023, according to the previous year’s methodology, the adjusted pay gap is 5.30% and the unadjusted pay gap is 8.86%.

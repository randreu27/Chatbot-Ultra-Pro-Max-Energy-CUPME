M7 PAI 7. Activities negatively affecting biodiversity-sensitive areas No significant environmental incidences concerning negative effects on 
biodiversity-sensitive areas have been reported in fiscal year 2024.
Effects on biodiversity-sensitive areas are not material for Siemens energy, 
however, we are continuously working towards increasing data transparency 
on biodiversity related indicators.
M8 PAI 8. Emissions to water We strive to adhere to local laws and regulations related to emissions to 
water.
Emissions to water are not material for Siemens Energy, however we are 
continuously working towards increasing data transparency.

(hazardous waste)17 24 We strive to adhere to local laws and regulations related to radioactive 
waste.
Radioactive waste is not material for Siemens Energy, however we are 
continuously working towards increasing data transparency.

¹  Includes category “use of sold products” only (well-to-tank emissions are included, biogenic emissions have been excluded). Siemens Gamesaʼs emissions equal zero.
²  Includes categories “purchased goods and services“ and “transportation and distribution” only.
³  Figures relate to Siemens Energy, taking into consideration all employees with active employment contracts and complete data available as of the end of each financial year. An unadjusted pay gap refers to the difference between the earnings of men vs. women (mean male vs. female FTE Total Direct Compensation in € using actual 
payout values based on incentive payout ratios from the previous fiscal year converted to hourly rates) that could arise from differences in a number of factors, for example, job families, geography, relative value of the position, seniority, or gender. The pay gap KPI is expressed as the difference between the mean male pay vs. the 
mean female pay, divided by the mean male pay. A positive pay gap KPI is one in favor of men, a negative one in favor of women.

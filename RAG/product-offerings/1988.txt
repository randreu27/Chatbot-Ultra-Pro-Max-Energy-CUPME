conformance reporting pro cess with external suppliers: https://cportal.siemens.com  
 
 
The Atlas Supplier Portal would offer two applications:

Benefits for you and us will include:  
 
• Proc ess transparency  
• Reduced susceptibility to errors  
• Savings on process costs  
• Assets optimization  
• Accelerate the processes  
 
 
Besides these functions the portal would serve as an interface to exchange non-controlled documents  related to 
the non -conformance process.  For further information, please refer to the supplier Fiori guidelines.    
 
Using the Atlas Supplier Portal will help both our companies to improve our non -conformance process and build 
the best possible sustainable, long -term business relationship. We would like to take this opportunity to thank you

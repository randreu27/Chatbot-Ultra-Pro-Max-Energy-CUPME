The success of an organization to meet the objectives of 
its Asset Integrity Management (AIM) depends largely on 
the implementation of a robust, effective, and efficient 
inspection, testing, and preventive maintenance (ITPM) 
program.
Siemens Energy Solutions 
We combine core competencies, effective engineering 
information management, and workflow optimization 
to deliver a streamlined framework, organization, 
implementation, and management of asset integrity 
management programs facility-wide. 
•  Expert Consulting:  with 25+ years of process safety 
experience, industry-leading tools, and methodologies 
helping define clients’ Inspection Data Management System 
(IDMS) program and Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) activities.
•  Advanced experience:  in the development of industry 
best practices of inspection, testing, and preventative 
maintenances (ITPM) programs, procedures, standards, 
and work processes to meet process safety management 
requirements.
•  Customized training:  providing interactive training  
courses tailored to your organization needs.Case Study
Implementation of an effective Asset Integrity Management 
program in a large oil refinery results in:
Asset availability:  30% reduction in turnarounds
Cost savings:  50% re reduction in preventitive 
maintenance costs in a long run
Cost-benefit risk analisys:  19% of inspection and 
maintenance activities were reduced while LOPC  
KPIs were improved
Life extension  of assets by identifiying mitigation

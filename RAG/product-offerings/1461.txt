Background on current challenges
Technical issues with 4.X and 5.X platforms
Lower availability levels triggered root-cause analysis
•Some 4.X and 5.X wind turbines showed abnormal vibrations 
during the regular remote monitoring
•Mainly blades and main bearings cause of vibrations
•Disqualification of certain third -party suppliers
Only limited part of the onshore fleet is affected
•4.X and 5.X wind turbines are affected
•Due to multi -sourcing, not all onshore wind turbines comprise the 
same components
Approach defined to address affected components
•Analysis was conducted pro -actively – customers did not report 
any operational failure
•All turbines are being monitored 24/7 via remote centers; 
additional inspection strategies have been implemented
•Replacement or repair of components depending on site -specific 
conditions
•Exchange of components is optimized to minimize downtimeWind turbine fleet1

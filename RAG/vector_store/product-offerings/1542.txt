in presentations, in material delivered to shareholders, and in press releases. In addition, our representatives may from tim e to time make oral forward -looking statements. Such 
statements are based on the current expectations and certain assumptions of Siemens Energy ´s management, of which many are beyond Siemens Energy ´s control. These are 
subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those described in disclosures , in particular in the chapter “Report on expected 
developments and associated material opportunities and risks” in the Annual Report. Should one or more of these risks or unce rtainties materialize, should acts of force majeure, 
such as pandemics, occur, or should underlying expectations including future events occur at a later date or not at all, or s hould assumptions prove incorrect, Siemens Energy ´s 
actual results, performance, or achievements may (negatively or positively) vary materially from those described explicitly o r implicitly in the relevant forward -looking statement. 
Siemens Energy neither intends, nor assumes any obligation, to update or revise these forward -looking statements in light of dev elopments which differ from those anticipated. This 
document includes supplemental financial measures –that are not clearly defined in the applicable financial reporting framework –and that are or may be alternative performance

target
© Siemens Energy, 2022 2022 -05-24CMD | K. Amin | Gas Services 7Increased demand for electric heat pumps to decarbonize coal -based 
district heating & cooling and industrial processes
Improved Central generation market outlook:
•Accelerated Coal to gas shift (Asia, China, US and East Europe)
•Backup for renewables
−UK wind offshore (2021): MW -hrprice increase ~£50 to >£400 in a year
−Texas snow -storm (2021): Triggered 10GW stand -by gas capacity need
−Capacity market in Europe: Italy, Belgium, Germany 
−Low rainy season in Latin America and China driving gas capacity 
additions and more utilization
Stable Service outlook 
Cyclic operations with higher number of start & stop leading to higher Service 
revenuesGS market outlook: Growth in Distributed, Central declining 
with improved outlook
Growth in Distributed both in new installations and in Service due to 
electricity demand increase in industries, oil & gas customers with rise in 
decarbonization requirementsGas gross capacity additions (in GW)

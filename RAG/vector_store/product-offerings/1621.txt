Press release  by Siemens Energy and  Porsche  
Construction begins on world’s first 
integrated commercial plant for producing 
CO2 -neutral fuel in Chile  
• Ground -breaking ceremony for the lighthouse Haru Oni project sponsored by the Federal Ministry 
of Economic Affairs  
• Porsche will use the practically CO 2-neutral eFuels in motor sports from 2022  
• Preparations for the next major commercial phase already underway  
 
Siemens Energy and sports car manufacturer Porsche have joined forces with a number of 
intern ational companies to build an industrial plant for the production of virtually CO 2-neutral fuel 
(eFuel) in Punta Arenas, Chile. The ground -breaking ceremony for this pioneering project took place 
today in the presence of Chile’s Energy Minister Juan Carlos  Jobet. A pilot plant is initially being built 
north of Punta Arenas in Chilean Patagonia, which is expected to produce around 130,000 litres of 
eFuels in 2022. The capacity will then be expanded in two stages to around 55  million litres by 
2024 and to aro und 550  million litres by 2026. The necessary environmental permits have now 
been obtained by the Chilean project company HIF (Highly Innovative Fuels). Siemens Energy has 
also already started preparatory work for the next major commercial phase of the pro ject.  
 
“I’m pleased that we’re making progress on this international lighthouse project for the hydrogen 
economy together with strong international partners from business and politics,” said Armin 
Schnettler, EVP for New Energy Business at Siemens Energy. “With H aru Oni, we’re bringing our Joint p ress release

power -to-X technologies to the global market. We’re jointly developing and realising the world’s first 
integrated and commercial large -scale plant for producing synthetic, climate -neutral fuels. In 
southern Chile, we’re implemen ting one of the energy industry’s most exciting projects for the 
future and driving forward the decar bonisation of the mobility sector. It means we’re making an 
important and rapidly effective contribution to reducing CO 2 emissions in the traffic and trans port 
sector.”  
 
The sports car manufacturer Porsche initiated the demonstration project and will be using the 
eFuels in its own combustion engine vehicles. Michael Steiner, Member of the Executive Board for 
Research and Development at Porsche AG, said: “Por sche was founded with pioneering spirit. That’s 
what drives us, we thrive on innovation. We also see ourselves as pioneers when it comes to 
renewable fuels, and we want to drive development forward. This fits in with our clear overall 
sustainability strate gy. It means that Porsche as a whole will have a CO 2 neutral balance sheet as 
early as 2030. Fuels produced with renewable energy can make a contribution to this. Our icon, the 
911, is particularly suitable for the use of eFuels. But so are our much -loved historic vehicles, 
because around 70  percent of all Porsches ever built are still on the road today. Our tests with 
renewable fuels are going very successfully. eFuels will make it possible to reduce fossil CO 2 
emissions in combustion engines by up to 90  percent. Among other things, we’ll be using the first 
fuel from Chile in our Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup race cars from 2022.”  
 
Chile has set itself ambitious targets as part of its National Green Hydrogen Strategy. It plans an 
electrolyser capacity of 5  gigaw atts (GW) by 2025, rising to 25  GW by 2030. The aim is to produce 
the world’s cheapest hydrogen and develop the country into a leading exporter of green hydrogen 
and its derivatives.  
 
The Haru Oni project takes advantage of the perfect climatic conditions for wind energy in 
Magallanes province in southern Chile to produce the CO 2-neutral fuel using low -cost green wind 
power. In the first step, electrolysers split water into oxygen and green hydrogen using wind power. 
CO 2 is then filtered from the air and co mbined with the green hydrogen to produce synthetic

mid-2022. In addition to Siemens Energy, Porsche and HIF, Enel, ExxonMobil, Gasco and ENAP are

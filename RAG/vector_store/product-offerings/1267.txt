 Earnings Release  Q1 FY 202 4 
October  1 to December  31, 2023 
Munich, Germany , February 7,  2024 – Siemens Energy  today announced  its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 202 4 that ended December  31, 
2023. 
Solid start to the year, turnaround of wind business remains focus  
“The solid first quarter is encouraging , in part  also due to project shifts, which are normal in plant engineering, especially with the market dynamics 
we are currently seeing. That is why our focus remains on solving the quality problems in our onshore wind business and makin g the most of the 
growth po tential for the rest of the company ”, says Christian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy AG.  
• Siemens Energy’s business development in the first quarter of the fiscal year was supported by continued favorable energy market  trend s. With 
a strong order development, i n particular Grid Technologies and Transformation of Industry were able to  take advantage  of these favorable 
conditions leading to the highest order s in a quarter to date . 
• For the full fiscal year , Siemens Energy confirm s its previously communicated outlook . 
• Orders increased year -over -year by 23.9% on a comparable basis (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects)  to €1 5.4bn. The b ook-to-
bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) was slightly above 2, driving the  order backlog to a new high of €11 8bn. 
• Revenue came in at  €7.6bn reflecting a 12. 6% increase on a comparable basis . While all segments contributed to growth, the increase was 
particularly strong at Grid Technologies . 
• Siemens Energy’s Profit  before special items sharply improved to  positive €208m. Prior year quarter ’s result  came in, burdened by quality related 
charges at Siemens Gamesa, at  negative  €282m. Special items amounted to  positive  €1,670m (Q 1 FY 2023: negative € 103m), driven  by a pre -
tax gain related to the sale of an 18 percent  stake in Siemens Limited, India, of € 1,729 m. As a result , Profit  for Siemens Energy came in at 
positive  €1,878m (Q 1 FY 2023: negative  €384m). 
• Due to the special items, Siemens Energy showed  a Net income  of €1,582m (Q 1 FY 2023: Net loss €598m). Corresponding basic earnings per 
share (EPS) were  positive  €1.79 (Q1 FY 2023: negative  €0.60). 
• Free cash flow pre tax was negative with €283m (Q1 FY 2023: negative  €58m). The decrease was primarily  due to  Siemens Gamesa , which 
suffered a high cash outflow due to a loss and a build -up of  operating net working capital in a seasonal weak quarter . Related to the sale of the 
stake in Siemens Limited, India,  Siemens Energy recorded a cash inflow of nearly €2.1bn  which is not reflected  in Free cash flow pre tax  however 
contributing to Adjusted Net cash .

1 Comparable basis: Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects . Orders developed year -over -year by  
20.9%  on a nominal basis, revenue respectively by  8.3% . 
 • Orders exceeded prior -year’s high comparative basis  primarily due to 
growth  at Grid Technologies and Transformation of Industry . Based 
on a substantially higher volume from large orders a ll segments re-
ported an increase.  
• Book -to-bill ratio came in at 2.01. Therefore, t he order backlog once 
again exceeded the previous record level and rose to  €118bn. 
• Revenue increased significantly . All segments contributed to the 
growth with a substantial rise at GT. 
• Service revenue improved significantly  and growing somewhat 
stronger than the new unit business . 
• Profit before Special items  sharply  increased with all segments im-
proving or around  prior year’s level . Prior year’s quarter was bur-
dened by quality related charges at Siemens Gamesa of €0.5bn . 
• Special items included the pre-tax gain from the sale of the centrally 
held stake in Siemens Limited, India, reported under  Reconciliation 
to Consolidated Financial Statements  (as strategic portfolio deci-
sions) . 
• Negative  Free cash flow pre tax was driven by  Siemens Gamesa  
which more than offset positive contributions from all other seg-
ments .

Asia. This more than offset a decrease in the Americas region from 
the high prior year’s level . 
• Book -to-bill ratio was 1.53. The o rder backlog  rose to €42bn. 
• Clear r evenue increase  in a seasonally strong quarter , with the ser-
vice business making the higher contribution to growth in absolute 
terms.  
• Profit before Special items nearly on the high level of prior year ’s

backlog rising to €28bn. 
• Revenue grew substantially in all businesses with main  contributions 
both from the product  and solution business es.

sharply  driven by  higher  volume  as well  as a comparatively higher 
margin of the processed order backlog.

sions ).

ter amounted to  €7bn. 
• Revenue was above prior -year quarter’s level in all businesses , at 
least with significant growth , based on execution of a strong order 
backlog and continuing service strength, particularly in the Compres-
sion and Industrial Steam Turbines & Generators businesses . 
• Profit  before Special items nearly doubled year -over -year  driven by

1 Comparable basis: Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects . Orders developed year -over -year by  
(2.7)%  on a nominal basis, revenue respectively by  1.7% . 
 • Orders were slightly above prior year quarter’s level  on a comparable 
basis as offshore and service businesses reported clear and signifi-
cant increases, respectively while on shore orders more than halved, 
largely due to a temporary interruption of  sales activities  for the 4.X 
and 5.X onshore turbines . Growth in the reporting regions Asia, Aus-
tralia and EMEA offset a sharp decline in the Americas . 
• Book-to-bill ratio came in at 0.77. The  order backlog decreased  to 
€41bn. 
• Revenue grew moderately based on  increased service revenue which 
more than offset a decline in the onshore and offshore businesses . 
• Profit before Special items was negative  but sharply improved com-
pared to prior year’s quarter which included charges of €472m re-
lated to quality issues. Recent  quarter’s result was driven by project 
margins burdened by higher planned costs due to the known quality 
issues as well as the increased product costs and ramp -up challenges 
in the offshore a rea in the prior fiscal year .

Considerations on U.S. tariffs –
mitigation measures in progressItisoneofourmost important markets with €7bnofrevenue infiscal year 2024 andorders ofmore than €10bn,which are
currently significantly increasing .Theorder backlog attheendoffiscal year 2024 stood ataround €24bn.
Based onthegreat potential weseeintheUnited States wecontinue toexpand ourfootprint intheUS.Wewillhave invested
roughly 500million Euro intheUnited States bytheendthisfiscal year since fiscal year 2023 .Siemens Energy has been
present intheUnited States for
more than 100 years and
some major acquisitions such
asthe Westinghouse Power
Generation business in1998
and Dresser Rand in2014
have increased our footprint
significantly .
Currently wehave eight major
manufacturing sites andatotal
ofaround 12,000 employees
working intheUnited States .
With thepotential tariffs impact intheU.S.,theoutlook fortheglobal economy hasbecome more uncertain .Weareclosely
monitoring thedevelopments andcontinuously analyzing thepotential impact .Atthesame time, wearetaking proactive steps
tomitigate those .Wehave setupaglobal task force toassess thebest approach forSiemens Energy, acknowledging the
complexity andfluidity ofthesituation .This isanongoing exercise, andwefocus onwhat wecancontrol .
When itcomes toexisting protections, wehave contractual terms such as
change -of-law clauses, which largely protect our equipment backlog .
According tothose, thecost associated with theimport arecharged tothe
customer .When itcomes totheservice business thepicture ismore
mixed .Contracts differ widely butservice contracts have incommon that
thecost base ismore local, andthatescalation clauses areembedded in
these contracts which provide uswithacertain degree ofprotection .
Although wearetoalarge degree covered through theduration ofour
backlog, weareworking onfurther mitigation measures with thetarget to
raise ourlocal content intheUnited States .This accounts tothesupply
chain aswellasourown production .This willtake time, andwearetaking
astep-by-step approach .Innew contracts, we will include price
adjustments andensure adequate protection clauses areutilized .
Inour raised guidance
forfiscal year 2025 we
have anticipated what
weknow asoftoday
with respect totariffs .
Forthesecond halfof

than conventional nuclear power plants .Rolls -Royce SMR iscurrently developing a"mini nuclear power plant" thatcanbe
operational much faster than traditionally built plants, thanks toitsstandardized, modular design .Rolls -Royce SMR's
pressurized water reactors aredesigned toachieve anelectrical output ofupto470MW, enough tosupply approximately 1.1
million households withelectricity .
Fordecades, Siemens Energy hasbeen asupplier andservice provider ofcomponents fortheso-called "power island," the
non-nuclear part ofthepower plant .SE’s solutions fornuclear power plants include steam turbines and generators with
outputs ranging from 20MWto1,900MW, aswellasoperational control technology andcontrol systems .

to drive profitability
Strategic cooperation to broaden portfolio
What  is an SMR?
SMRs arecompact nuclear power plants, often referred
toasmini nuclear power plants .They can be
prefabricated and assembled inafactory, then
transported tothesiteready foruse.This significantly
reduces construction time, complexity and costs .They
require significantly less space than conventional
nuclear power plants .
How does a Small Modular Reactor work?
An SMR operates similarly totraditional nuclear
reactors butonasmaller scale .The core contains
nuclear fuel, typically uranium, which releases a
significant amount ofheat through nuclear fission .This
heat converts water intosteam, which drives aturbine
connected toagenerator, thus producing electricity .Siemens Energy and Rolls -Royce SMR have entered into a
partnership agreement that isexpected tolead totheexclusive
supply ofconventional technology forfuture Small Modular
Reactors (SMR) .Under thisagreement, Siemens Energy istobe
the sole supplier ofsteam turbines, generators, and other
auxiliary systems for the British manufacturer's planned
Generation 3+modular nuclear power plants .The final contract,
detailing allspecifics, isexpected tobecompleted bytheend of
2025 .
SMRs areconsidered apromising technology forthefuture of
nuclear energy and akey factor inthesuccess oftheenergy
transition .They aremore compact, safer, andmore cost-efficient
Proven Offshore track record –5,000thOffshore turbine installed
In1991 ,Wind Power made history byinstalling theworld’s first offshore wind farm atVindeby,
Denmark .What began with 11turbines ofjust 450kWeach has now grown into aremarkable
achievement :theinstallation ofour5,000thoffshore turbine attheSofia Offshore Wind Farm inthe
UK.This isoneoftheworld’s largest offshore wind farms andthelargest inRWE’s offshore portfolio .
Our 5,000 offshore turbines have been installed across 14countries ,including Belgium, China,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, the
United Kingdom, andtheU.S.,with atotal capacity exceeding 27GW.With acombined output of
approximately 540billion kWh, our5,000offshore turbines now power over 27million households with
clean energy –saving around 139million tons ofCO₂emissions .Ourjourney isnotonly atestament to
innovation and dedication butalso amajor step forward inthefight against climate change .This
achievement isnotjustacelebration ofthepast —it’sapromise forthefuture .

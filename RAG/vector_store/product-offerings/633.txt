Improved part load operation Four stages of fast-acting variable-pitch guide vanes (VGV) will grant you optimized performance over a wide range of operating conditions, improved part load efficiency, low part load emissions, and high load transients. Proven in commercial operation Around 91 H-class gas turbines are in commercial operation, with more than 3.5 million fired hours. Core engine Package solutions Power plants Service Fuels Emissions Ingenious design to the core The rotor is based on self-centering and -aligning discs with Hirth serration and central tie rod, providing you with the advantage of on-site rotor maintenance. The advanced can annular combustion system creates a uniform temperature profile at the turbine entry, ensuring a high fuel flexibility and reliability of your gas turbine. Moderate firing temperatures allow the use of proven materials that improve reliability while reducing maintenance, leading to excellent availability. Fast start-up rotor design Light and stiff rotor design with internal air passages allows faster thermal transients and world-class fast cold start and hot restart capability. Combined cycle base load within 30 min for hot start. Full on-board air cooling On-board valves ensure controlled cooling air supply, to cover the needs of different operating conditions. Standardized design, flexible solutions The SGT6-8000H package solution consists of the core turbine, an SGen6-1000A generator (or optionally, an SGen6-2000P generator), and auxiliary systems. We offer you a standardized basic design with options geared to your specific requirements, as well as flexible solutions for short installation times and economic power generation. By grouping subsystems and installing them in separate auxiliary packages, we strive to minimize field assembly. The gas turbine generator packages have a compact footprint designed for limited space requirements. SGT6-8000H gas turbine package for multi-shaft plants Designed for short installation times, all package piping is prefabricated to minimize pipe cleaning and welding onsite. Package footprint: Length: 64 m (210 ft) Width: 40 m (130 ft) Gas turbine enclosure height: 11.5 m (38 ft) Air intake options The air intake is suitable for different multistage filters, e.g., pre-filter, fine- and/or HEPA filter or self-cleaning pulse filter systems. The use of an air intake silencer significantly reduces the pressure drop with improved noise reduction, thus ensuring compliance with noise protection regulations. Anti-icing systems and inlet air cooling with evaporative cooler are available as an option. The SGT6-8000H fires up Combined cycle power plants based on the SGT6-8000H (plant name: SCC6-8000H) are profitable solutions for competitive energy markets with fluctuating power demand. Featuring a fast-start capability, it will achieve combined cycle base load within 30 min for hot start (start-up gradient: 30 MW/min). High load gradients allow for fast load changes. With excellent peaking capabilities, and a high part load efficiency with emission compliance down to lower part load, the SGT6-8000H plants strike an optimal balance between capital costs, performance, and operational considerations. SCC6-8000H single-shaft plant The main components of the SCC6-8000H 1S power plant are arranged on a single shaft. This enables a small footprint, and high operational flexibility and reliability. SCC6-8000H multi-shaft plant The SGT6-8000H multi-shaft plants can be based on one (SCC6-8000H 1x1), two (SCC6-8000H 2x1), three (SCC6-8000H 3x1) or more H-class gas turbines.

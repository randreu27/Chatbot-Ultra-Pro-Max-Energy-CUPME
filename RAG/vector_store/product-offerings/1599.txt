HL-class gas turbines
The next generation of advanced 
air-cooled gas turbines
The HL-class is paving the way to the next 
level of efficiency and performance. This 
evolutionary development step, derived 
from proven H-class technology, combines a 
series of new but already tested technolo-
gies. The result: A technology carrier to the 
next level with a combined cycle efficiency 
beyond 64%.
The HL-class consists of the  
SGT5-9000HL engine for 50 Hz 
and the SGT6-9000HL for 60 Hz.

6Key technologies
1Evolutionary 3D blading for 
higher aero-efficiency
2Advanced combustion 
system for higher firing 
temperatures and more 
operational flexibility
3Innovative multi-layer 
coating for better blade 
robustness and less 
cooling-air consumption
4Ultra-efficient internal 
cooling features for blades 
and vanes for less cooling 
air consumption
5Optimized sealings for 
inimized leakage air
6Large free-standing turbine 
blade 4 for higher power 
output

The shift to Zero -harm 
switchgear
In the battle against climate change, 
renewable energy sources alone will not be 
enough to enable the energy industry to 
reach net zero. It’s essential that we achieve 
Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the 
transmission of power as well as in its 
generation.
That means the elimination of climate -hostile 
fluorinated gases (F -gases) from electrical 
switchgear –especially SF6.
Recent EU legislation has restricted the use 
of these gases and allows only GWP < 1 
solutions if available.
More environmentally -friendly products are 
the way forward, and with this in mind, 
Siemens Energy has developed the Blue 
portfolio: innovative solutions which use 
Zero greenhouse gases of any kind, and 
which have Zero harmful impact on the 
environment.
Solutions such as our 8VN1 Blue GIS
 .
Zero SF6–just clean air
The 8VN1 uses clean air insulation and 
vacuum switching technology for voltages 
up to 145 kV.
The technology is well proven; we have over 
40 years of experience in vacuum switching 
technology, with high -voltage applications
being developed since 2012.Clean air is sustainable, non -toxic and the 
only way to achieve Zero GWP. Consisting 
of 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned 
and free of humidity, it can be released into 
the atmosphere with Zero harmful effects 
to people or the environment.
Zero special training is needed to transport, 
handle or operate the clean air GIS. Zero 
maintenance of the interrupter unit is 
required since it is sealed for life. And there 
are Zero costs involved in disposing of the 
clean air at the end of the product’s life.
High -voltage, high -
performance
The 8VN1 maintains the highest standards of 
technical performance and reliability, 
together with low lifecycle costs.
Operating at up to 145 kV, it delivers 
excellent interrupting performance at rated 
nominal current and rated short circuit 
current without degradation.
It also has a long working life, due to being 
hermetically sealed to protect it from 
anything which may cause decomposition.
It’s ready for the future. Because clean air is 
the future.Vacuum  technology

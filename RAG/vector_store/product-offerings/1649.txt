May 2022Revamp for Increased Heat 
Extraction (Applicable for all SST Fleet)
Benefits1
•In a recent success story involving a 6.6MW compressor driven IST in a 
Process Industry, we achieved,
•~13 MWth additional heat extraction
•~30,000 t/a CO2 reduction
•< 2 years in ROI  
•Cost and productivity benefits from increased lifetime expectancy of the turbine
•CO2 savings from fuel optimization resulting from shutdown of additional 
boilers
•Scope of work & Implementation
•Increased heat extraction can be achieved in one the following ways, 
•Change bleeding to controlled extraction
•Optimizing the existing steam path
•Converting the condensing turbine to back pressure turbine
•The revamp is recommended to be done during a major overhaul. 
Existing structural components will be reused as much as possibleFeatures
•Customized steam parameters
•New steam path to increase the lifetime expectancy of the turbine
•New turbine internals to provide maximum turbine efficiency
•Re-use of existing outer casing and auxiliaries contributing to reduced costs 
and shut -down timeProduct Overview 
Typically suited for customers having -Higher earnings for selling heat 
than power; Low electricity prices; Government subsidies for power 
cogeneration
Up to 30,000 
tons less CO2
per year1
1 Benefits depend on the unit type, MW, and application and will differ from customer to customer.

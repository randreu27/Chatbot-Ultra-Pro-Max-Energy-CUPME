May 2022Steam Turbine Solution 
for transitioning from Coal to Biomass 
Benefits1
•Let’s assume that a customer in district heating want to change the 
heating fuel source from coal to biomass,
•~ 100% power output from sustainable resources
•~ 100% CO2 savings when compared with fossil fuel emissions –
Carbon emissions from biomass is part of the biogenic carbon 
cycle in which the plant simply returns the CO2 that it used up to 
grow2
•< 3 years in ROI  
Scope of work & Implementation
•The transition process begins with a study followed by a customized new 
turbine revamp solution 
•The revamp is recommended to be done during the implementation of the 
new biomass boilerFeatures
•New turbine/ turbine internals to accommodate for the differences in boiler 
conditions between coal and biomass
•New steam path with optimized blading
•No modifications required on the existing piping and peripheryProduct Overview 
Suited for customers wanting to change their fuel source from coal to 
biomass

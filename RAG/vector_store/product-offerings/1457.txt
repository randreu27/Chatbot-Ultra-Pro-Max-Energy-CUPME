The growing electricity market drives high demand forour products aswesupport ourcustomers to
facilitate thisgrowth andtodeal withthechallenges oftheenergy transition .
Recently, Gas Services received arecord high order of$1.5bnfrom theKingdom ofSaudi Arabia .Saudi
Arabia has astrategy toreach netzero by2060 and isrelying onmodern, highly efficient gas-fired
power plants incombination with CO2capture and storage, to
significantly reduce itsemissions .
Taiba 2and Qassim 2willbetwooftheworld’s most efficient gas
fired power plants with acapacity of2gigawatt each .Each plant will
befitted with atotal ofthree ofourmost powerful gasturbines (HL-
class) ,steam turbines and generators .The CO2output will be
reduced by60%.They canbefitted with carbon capture andstorage
facilities atalater point intime.Inaddition, Siemens Energy hasalso
entered a25years long -term maintenance contract forthe two
power plants .
Transformation ofIndustries wasawarded acontract foralarge scale
hydrogen project from theGerman utility EWE .
Siemens Energy will supply a280-megawatt electrolysis system .
Theplant intheGerman cityofEmden isexpected togointo operation
in2027 and will provide upto26,000 tons ofgreen hydrogen
annually forvarious industrial applications intheregion .Ifthisgreen
hydrogen replaces fossil fuels, around 800,000 tons ofCO2peryear
could beavoided inthesteel industry, forexample .

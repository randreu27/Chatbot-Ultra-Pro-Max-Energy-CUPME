NOTICE TO SUPPLIERS   
 
 
For the attention of the Managing Director   
 
Dear Sir or Madam   
 
This Notice to Suppliers (NTS) is issued to inform stakeholders of recent developments 
concerning the REACH Authorisation framework, particularly pertaining to the use of 
chromium compounds within the European Economic Area (EEA), which encompasses 
Norther n Ireland, as well as Great Britain (GB). This communication serves as a proactive 
measure to assist you in your ongoing compliance efforts and to encourage consideration of 
the potential implications for supply continuity.  
 
Scope/Applicability.   
There has been considerable progress in the renewal and update of REACH Authorisations for 
water -soluble chromates. In some cases, the associated Authorisation Decisions include more 
stringent conditions of use, which apply either to direct users or to tho se operating under an 
upstream supplier's Authorisation.  
 
Key Reminders:  
• An Authorisation may be held either by the user of a chemical or an upstream supplier. It must 
apply  to the specific use case and product sector.  
• In accordance with Article 66 of REACH , downstream users operating under an upstream 
Authorisation must notify the relevant authority ECHA  for the EU/EEA or HSE for GB and 
provide the correct Authorisation Number.  
• Users must comply with all relevant conditions of use, including those outlined in the Safety 
Data Sheet (SDS)  and the official Authorisation Decision . 
• Some authorizations now include conditions based on Best Available Technology, such as the 
installation of Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV) or other engineering controls, along with 
adjustments to reduce worker exposure and improve workplace separation from  chromates.  
 
Supplier Considerations . 
We understand that meeting these requirements can be quite challenging, especially for smaller 
suppliers who may face significant technical and financial hurdles. This situation might lead 
some to reconsider their chromate -related operations, and we know that could threaten the 
consistency of supply.  
 
While Siemens Energy may not have all the power to change the landscape, it's important for us 
to acknowledge these risks and maintain open lines of communication with our supply chain 
partners. Our aim is to foster awareness and support informed decision -making rather than just 
enforcing compliance. We want to work together to find the best path forward.

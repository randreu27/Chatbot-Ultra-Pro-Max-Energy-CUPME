OOTTV  – Gimpel Oil Operated Trip T hrottle Valve  B
ackground
SE Gimpel ’s oil operated trip throttle valve 
(OOTTV) is designed to close (trip) after a 
loss of oil supply pressure and does not reo-
pen until oil pressure has been re-estab-
lished.
The OOTTV (inverted globe body) is recom-
mended for steam turbines driving the main 
process compressors in API-612 critical ser-
vice applications in chemical and petro-
chemical plants, refineries and synchronous 
generators in power generation facilities 
with normal inlet steam pressure up to 900 
psig (63.4 kg/cm2g).
Design
The OOTTV is designed to use hydraulic pres-
sure supplied by the turbine control oil sys-
tem to compress a fully enclosed, large di-
ameter trip spring. This trip spring allows an 
OOTTV to typically produce four to 10 times 
the closing force of a mechanical latch-type 
trip throttle valve during tripping.  The 
OOTTV is designed with pull-to-close opera-
tion and features a backseated stem that re-
sults in no continuous valve stem leakage 
when the valve is operating in its normal, 
fully-open position.
The OOTTV can be designed for start-up or 
extraction non-return valve service in appli-
cations that use a high-pressure extraction 
steam header for unit start-up.
The OOTTV achieved the functional safety 
certificate for application up to SIL 3.
Features
The OOTTV can be furnished in several body 
style and assembly arrangements, and can 
be installed with the valve stem in a horizon-
tal or vertical position.Standard features:  
• SIL 3 certificated  
• API 612 compliant  
• Trips in 0.3 seconds or less  
• ANSI NPS 3 to 24 and Class 150 to 2500  
• Steam temperature up to 1,004°F 
(540°C)  
• RF valve body drain and valve stem leak -
off connections  
• Stainless steel, integral, replaceable 
steam strainer basket  
• Handwheel provides throttling for use 
during start -up 
• Low pressure (100 – 200 psi g) and high 
pressure (1,100 – 1,600 psig) hydraulic 
actuators available  
 
Optional features:  
• Limit switches to monitor valve stem po-
sitions  
• Solenoid exerciser for remote on -line ex-
ercising  
• Electric actuator for remote valve opera-
tion 
• Protective cover (for h arsh climate in-
stallations)  
• Temporary start -up screen with spare 
cover gasket  
• Blowdown kits  
 
To ensure high accessibility, an oil mist sep-
arator with two fans can be used. This is par-
ticularly important if the turbine tend to leak 
oil. 
The filter allows fo r at least five years of op-
eration between changes. We recommend 
that the installation is carried out by quali-
fied Siemens  Energy  personnel during an 
overhaul or other turbine shutdown. Piping 
is preferably constructed by the customer 
supervised by Siemens  Energy  personnel.

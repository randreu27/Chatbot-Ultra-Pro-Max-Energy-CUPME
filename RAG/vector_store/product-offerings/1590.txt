Q2 FY2022 Siemens Energy Shareholder Letter Page 1Dear shareholders,
Ihope youaredoing wellinthese challenging times .
OnMay 11,ourCEO, Christian Bruch, and ourCFO, Maria
Ferraro, presented ourQ2results forfiscal year 2022 .Three
weeks after wehadtopre-release ourpreliminary results onApril
19,due totheprofit warning atSiemens Gamesa Renewables
Energy (SGRE) .
“Gas andPower (GP) delivered asolid performance thisquarter .
The segment delivered asolid operating result andastrong order
intake despite first impacts ofthesanctions against Russia and
increasing supply chain constraints .Disappointing again isthe
performance ofSGRE which isweighing heavily onSiemens
Energy (SE).The situation atSGRE hasaggravated further since
thelastprofit warning inQ1.Asmajority shareholder ,weprovide
ourexpertise togettothebottom oftheproblems andtotackle the
issues” ,said Christian Bruch .
During thequarter wecontinued tosee global supply chain
constraints impacting ourbusiness .This was mainly thecase
atSGRE, where these supply chain constraints amplified the
difficulties originating inoperational problems .Asaresult, SGRE
reported anAdjusted EBITA loss of€301mforthesecond quarter .
Jochen Eickholt, thenew CEO ofSGRE, has already puta
program inplace with animmediate focus ontackling these
problems andtoachieve margin expansion inthemedium term.
Inthequarter wehad solid orders of€7.9bn,including astrong
contribution from GP,forourorder backlog toreach arecord high
of€89.3bn.Compared totheexceptionally high prior-year figure,
orders declined by27%onacomparable basis because ofSGRE .
Revenue declined by1.7%(onacomparable basis) to€6.6bnas
moderate growth atGPwas more than offset byadecline at
SGRE .Due totheloss atSGRE SEsuffered anAdj.EBITA loss
before special items (SI)of€77mandwereported anetloss of
€252m.Basic earnings pershare were negative €0.22.
Despite thewar inUkraine and supply chain challenges our
expectations forGP, remain intact forfiscal year 2022 .However,
givenSGRE’s adjusted aspiration and inlight ofprevailing
challenges, wenow expect Siemens Energy results forfiscal
year 2022 towards thelow end oftheguidance ranges for
comparable revenue development (neg.2%topos.3%)and the
Adjusted EBITA margin before special items (pos.2%topos.4%).
Onthenext pages, weprovide you with anoverview onraw
material price developments and political initiatives against the
European dependence onRussian gas, which also provide
opportunities forus.
Ivery much hope youwillhave thechance tofollow ourCapital
Market Day onMay 24,onourwebsite .

The EUannounced theREPowerEU program toreduce dependence onRussian fossil fuels,
proposing theacceleration ofrenewable energy deployment andenergy efficiency .See below some
oftheprogram’s goals :
Solar & wind energy
By 2030: 
•480GW of wind (~48GW / year)
•420GW of solar

•Faster permitting
•Shorter time for roll -out of renewable 
projects and grid infrastructure 
improvements
Hydrogen accelerator
•Develop infractructure, storage facilities and ports
•Replace Russian gas with additional:
•10 Mt of imported renewable hydrogen
•5 Mt of domestic renewable hydrogen

Q2 FY2022 Siemens Energy Shareholder Letter Page 3Siemens Energy : opportunities due to governmental frameworks
Thecurrent situation isaproof point fortheimportance ofspeeding uptheenergy transition towards
more secure, reliable and sustainable energy sources .The new government frameworks provide
opportunities forSiemens Energy tosupport societies andcustomers totransform withitsportfolio :
1)onshore andoffshore wind energy offerings
2)production ofelectrolyzers forgreen hydrogen
3)solutions toimprove existing gasturbines efficiencies andhydrogen -ready upgrades
4)compression forheat pumps andLNG terminals .

Outlook forfiscal year 2022
FortheGPsegment inFY2022 ,wemaintain ourguidance forcomparable revenue growth (excluding currency
translation andportfolio effects) between positive 1%andpositive 5%,andAdjusted EBITA margin before special
items between positive 4.5%andpositive 6.5%.However, inlight ofprevailing challenges, weexpect results towards
thelowendoftheguidance ranges .ForFY2023 ,weconfirm ourtarget ofanAdjusted EBITA margin before special
items inarange between positive 6%andpositive 8%.
Given SGRE’s performance ofthefirsthalfyear andcontinued internal andexternal uncertainties, SGRE announced
that itsprevious guidance ofacomparable decline ofrevenue between negative 2%and negative 9%and an
Adjusted EBITA margin before special items inarange ofnegative 4%topositive 1%isnolonger valid.According to
SGRE, thecompany cannot provide projections forthesecond halfoftheyear withthedesirable detail andprecision
butwillcontinue towork toachieve acomparable revenue development within therange ofnegative 2%andnegative
9%,andAdjusted EBITA margin before special items towards thelowendoftheprevious guidance range ofnegative
4%.
ForSiemens Energy inFY2022 ,wenow expect results towards thelowendoftheguidance ranges forcomparable
revenue development (negative 2%topositive 3%)andAdjusted EBITA margin before special items (positive 2%to
positive 4%).Consequently, weexpect Netloss tobelevel with prior year compared totheprevious guidance ofa
sharp improvement .Weconfirm expectations fortheFree cash flow pretaxtobeinarange ofapositive mid-triple -
digit million€.
Because ofthewarinUkraine andthesanctions imposed onRussia theoperating environment forSiemens
Energy hasbecome more challenging .Siemens Energy iscomplying with allsanctions andhasstopped any
new business inRussia .Siemens Energy hasstarted toseeanimpact onrevenue andprofitability asaresult of
thewarandisexperiencing anaggravation oftheexisting supply chain challenges .Wearecurrently notable to
fully assess thepotential impact fortheremainder ofthefiscal year and cantherefore notrule outfurther
negative effects mainly onrevenue, profitability andrecoverability ofassets .Inaddition, wenote arising impact
related totheCOVID -19situation inChina .
This guidance assumes nofurther major financial impacts from COVID -19onourbusiness activity and excludes
charges related tolegal and regulatory matters including further negative effects from thewarinUkraine and its
economic consequences .

1.2.1.2 Major shareholders
As of the date of the Prospectus, all of the Existing Shares, currently representing all of the shares in the
Company, are held directly or indirectly by Siemens AG, so that the Company is controlled by Siemens AG.
Following Spin-Off Completion, Siemens AG and Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. will initially hold 35.1% and
9.9%, respectively, of the Shares, representing the Existing Shares. The New Shares, which will thenrepresent 55% of the Shares, will be transferred to the shareholders of Siemens AG. The number of NewShares attributable to each shareholder of Siemens AG depends on the percentage of shares in Siemens AGheld by such shareholder immediately prior to Spin-Off Completion.
In order to prevent Siemens AG from controlling the Company after Spin-Off Completion, the Company and
Siemens AG entered into a deconsolidation agreement ( Entherrschungsvertrag ) which, inter alia , restricts
the exercise of the voting rights attached to the Existing Shares. Under the deconsolidation agreement,Siemens undertakes vis-à-vis the Company that, among other things, there will be a maximum of threeshareholders’ representatives in the Company’s supervisory board who are dependent on Siemens, e.g.,
members of the executive board ( Vorstand ) of Siemens AG. For purposes of the deconsolidation agreement,
membership in the supervisory board of Siemens AG alone does not result in that person being dependenton Siemens. Accordingly, union representatives who are members of both the supervisory board of SiemensAG and the supervisory board of the Company are deemed to be independent of Siemens under thedeconsolidation agreement, although their dual mandates may result in conflicts of interest (see“1.4.3.3 Material conflicts of interest pertaining to the Listing ”).
1.2.1.3 Executive board
The Company’s executive board ( Vorstand ) has four members. Dr.-Ing. Christian Bruch acts as the chief
executive officer (CEO, Vorstandsvorsitzender ) of the Company. Ms. Maria Ferraro acts as chief financial
officer (CFO) of the Company. Mr. Tim Oliver Holt acts as Segment Manager for the Gas and Power segment(Transmission) and the SGRE segment and as future Labor Director ( Arbeitsdirektor ). Dr.-Ing. Jochen Eickholt
acts as Segment Manager for the Gas and Power segment (Generation and Industrial Applications).
1.2.1.4 Statutory auditors
Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, Germany with a business address at
Arnulfstraße 59, 80636 Munich, Germany (“ EY”) are the independent auditors of the Company.
1.2.2 What is the key financial information regarding the issuer?
The audited combined financial statements of Siemens Energy as of and for the fiscal years ended
September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (the “ Audited Combined Financial Statements ”) were prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“ IFRS”)
and have been audited in accordance with Section 317 of the German Commercial Code(Handelsgesetzbuch ) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement
Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany ( IDW)) by
EY, who issued an unqualified independent auditor’s report thereon. The unaudited condensed combinedinterim financial statements of Siemens Energy as of and for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020were prepared in accordance with IFRS on interim financial reporting (IAS 34) (the “ Unaudited Condensed
Combined Interim Financial Statements ”). The Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited
Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements (together, the “ Combined Financial Statements ”)
present the combined group of entities and business activities comprising the Siemens Energy business inthe fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and in the nine-month period ended June 30,2020. During these periods, Siemens Energy did not conduct business operations as an independent group.Furthermore, investors should note that financial information regarding our SGRE segment has beenexclusively taken or derived from the Combined Financial Statements or from our accounting records orinternal management reporting systems and does not necessarily correspond to financial informationpublicly reported by SGRE S.A.
In the summary of the Prospectus, where financial information is labeled “audited” in tables, this
information was taken from the Audited Combined Financial Statements. The label “unaudited” is used intables in the summary of the Prospectus to indicate financial information that was taken from theUnaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements, or from our accounting records or internalmanagement reporting systems or has been calculated based on figures from the above-mentioned sources.Figures have been commercially rounded to whole numbers. Because of rounding, figures shown in thetables below do not necessarily add up exactly to the respective totals or subtotals presented andaggregated percentages may not exactly equal 100%. Financial information presented in parenthesesdenotes the negative of such number presented. In respect of financial information set out below, a dash(“—”) signifies that the relevant figure is not available or equals zero, while a zero (“0”) or nil signifies thatthe relevant figure is available but has been rounded to zero.

1.2.3 What are the key risks that are specific to the issuer?
An investment in the Company’s shares is subject to a number of risks, some of which are presented in this
section and under section “ 1.3.3 What are the key risks that are specific to the securities? ” of this summary.
The occurrence of any of the following, individually or together, could materially adversely affect theSiemens Energy Group’s business, financial position, results of operations, reputation and prospects. If anyof these risks were to materialize, investors could lose all or part of their investments.
The following risks are key risks specific to the Company: The energy market is subject to disruptive developments, such as the trend towards decarbonization, and
we may be too slow or even fail in adapting our business model and product portfolio.
 We may fail to comply with environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and expectations
which could adversely impact our business and reputation. At the same time, compliance with certain ESGstandards may pose additional challenges to our business.
 Our industries and business operations are subject to various risks relating to global or local outbreaks of
infectious diseases and other public health crises. In particular, we are affected from the fallout of theoutbreak of the recent Coronavirus pandemic.
 Competition and lower market prices could negatively affect our business, financial position and results of
operations.
 We may not be able to successfully implement our strategies; in particular we may fail to successfully
complete cost savings and other reorganization programs, benefit from the disruptive trends in globalenergy markets and increase the share of our service business.
 We may be unable to successfully develop and launch a portfolio of competitive and technologically-
advanced products, services and solutions, and our research and development efforts may be unsuccessful.Furthermore, the pace of technological change may result in the economic life cycle of certain of ourproducts being shorter than anticipated.
 Operational failures in our value chain processes and quality issues could negatively affect our business
and reputation, and result in claims, penalties and additional costs.
 We are dependent on the availability of certain materials, parts and components, and any disruptions in
the supply chain may result in additional costs or loss of revenues.
 Our project business is subject to several risks, including execution risks, cost overruns, quality and political
risks.
 In connection with existing and potential future reorganization and cost savings measures, we may incur
substantial restructuring expenses and cash outflows. We may not be able to realize expected cost savingsor we may fail to adjust our organizational and manufacturing footprint in a timely manner or at all, andsuch reorganizations may not yield the targeted benefits or may damage our reputation.
 We may have to write down inventories or other assets, which could adversely affect our financial
position and result in loss of profitability.
 Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, which could be
significantly reduced if we had to recognize impairments.
 Our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers require access to significant credit and
guarantee lines and other financing instruments. Our business activities could be negatively affected if weare unable to meet our capital requirements in the future, for example in weak financial marketenvironments, as a result of a significant deterioration of our credit standing or of a breach of a creditfacility agreement, or if access to capital becomes more expensive. Our business activities could besimilarly negatively affected if our customers or suppliers do not have access to financing on economicallyviable terms.
 Our Gas and Power segment and, to a lesser extent, our SGRE segment may lose business opportunities
and face a negative perception of our stand-alone position following our separation from the SiemensGroup. Further, as a stand-alone group, we may not be able to satisfy financial or technical requirementsunder public procurement laws.

1.4.3.2 Listing agreement
The Company, Siemens AG as well as BNP PARIBAS, Merrill Lynch International (BofA Securities),
COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, Deutsche BankAktiengesellschaft, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE and J.P. Morgan Securities plc, acting as lead financialadvisors and listing agents (the “ Listing Agents ”) and Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, HSBC Trinkaus &
Burkhardt AG and Jefferies International Limited (the “ Co-Advisors ” together with the Listing Agents, the
“Banks ”) entered into a listing agreement dated September 6, 2020 (the “ Listing Agreement ”) in
connection with the Spin-Off and the Listing. In the Listing Agreement, the Company and Siemens AGagreed to indemnify the Banks against certain liability obligations that may arise in connection with theSpin-Off and the Listing. Moreover, the Company agreed to refrain from issuing new shares or taking similaractions during the period commencing on the date of the Listing Agreement and ending 180 days after thefirst day of trading of the Company’s Shares on the FSE. The Listing Agreement also provides that theobligations of the Banks to facilitate the Listing are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,including, for example, the receipt of customary confirmations and legal opinions satisfactory to therequirements of the Banks.

The current members of the executive board of the Company (as well as other executives of Siemens Energy)
have been granted a Spin-Off incentive, i.e., a transaction bonus if certain target values for the effects of
the Spin-Off or the market value are achieved upon Spin-Off Completion and within the first 120 days afterSpin-Off Completion, based on the average volume-weighted price of the Shares of the Company.
After Spin-Off Completion, six members (including three union representatives) of the Company’s
supervisory board are expected to remain executive board members or supervisory board members oremployees of Siemens AG.
Siemens AG has an interest in the Spin-Off as it serves the purpose of disposing of a majority shareholding in
and deconsolidating Siemens Energy.
The Listing Agents or their affiliates act as lenders to the Company, primarily under a facility agreement.
Furthermore, the Banks or certain of their respective affiliates have performed, and are likely to perform inthe future, certain advisory or other services for Siemens Energy or for Siemens AG or certain of theirsubsidiaries in their capacity as financial institutions, in particular advisory services in connection withfinancing transactions, for which they have received, and are likely to receive in the future, customary feesand expenses.

2.2.1.2 Hauptanteilseigner
Zum Datum des Prospekts werden alle Existierenden Aktien, die derzeit sämtliche Aktien der Gesellschaft
darstellen, direkt oder indirekt von der Siemens AG gehalten, so dass die Gesellschaft von der Siemens AGbeherrscht wird.
Nach dem Abspaltungsvollzug werden die Siemens AG und der Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. zunächst 35,1%
bzw. 9,9% der Aktien der Gesellschaft halten, wobei es sich um die Existierenden Aktien handelt. Die NeuenAktien, die dann 55% der Aktien der Gesellschaft ausmachen, werden an die Aktionäre der Siemens AGübertragen. Die Anzahl der Neuen Aktien, die dem einzelnen Aktionär der Siemens AG zustehen, entsprichtdessen prozentualem Anteil an den Aktien der Siemens AG unmittelbar vor dem Abspaltungsvollzug.

2.2.3 Welches sind die zentralen Risiken, die für die Emittentin spezifisch sind?
Eine Investition in die Aktien der Gesellschaft unterliegt einer Reihe von Risiken, von denen einige in diesem
Abschnitt und unter Abschnitt “ 2.3.3 Welches sind die zentralen Risiken, die für die Wertpapiere spezifisch
sind? ” dieser Zusammenfassung dargestellt werden. Das Auftreten der folgenden Risiken könnte, allein
oder zusammen, die Geschäfts-, Finanz- und Ertragslage, den Ruf sowie die Aussichten der Siemens Energy-Gruppe erheblich nachteilig beeinträchtigen. Wenn sich eines oder mehrere der genannten Risikenverwirklichen sollten, könnten Anleger ihre Investition ganz oder teilweise verlieren.
Die folgenden Risiken sind zentrale Risiken, die für die Gesellschaft spezifisch sind: Der Energiemarkt unterliegt disruptiven Elementen, wie zum Beispiel dem Trend zu Dekarbonisierung,
und wir könnten zu langsam oder sogar gar nicht in der Lage sein, unser Geschäftsmodell undProduktportfolio entsprechend anzupassen.
 Wir könnten möglicherweise nicht in der Lage sein, die Umwelt-, Sozial- und
Unternehmensführungsstandards und -erwartungen (environmental, social and governance (ESG)) zuerfüllen, was sich negativ auf unsere Geschäftslage und unseren Ruf auswirken könnte. Gleichzeitig kanndie Einhaltung von bestimmten ESG-Standards eine zusätzliche Herausforderung für unsereGeschäftstätigkeit darstellen.
 Unsere Industrien und Geschäftstätigkeiten sind verschiedenen Risiken in Bezug auf globale oder lokale
Ausbrüche von ansteckenden Krankheiten und anderen Krisen für die öffentliche Gesundheit ausgesetzt.Insbesondere sind wir von den Folgen des Ausbruchs der jüngsten Coronavirus-Pandemie betroffen.
 Wettbewerb und niedrigere Marktpreise könnten unsere Geschäfts-, Finanz- und Ertragslage negativ
beeinflussen.
 Wir sind möglicherweise nicht in der Lage, unsere Strategien erfolgreich umzusetzen, insbesondere könnte
es sein, dass es uns nicht gelingt, Kosteneinsparungs- und andere Reorganisationsprogramme erfolgreichabzuschließen von den disruptiven Trends der globalen Energiemärkte zu profitieren und den Anteilunseres Servicegeschäfts zu erhöhen.
 Wir sind möglicherweise nicht in der Lage, erfolgreich ein Portfolio wettbewerbsfähiger und
technologisch fortgeschrittener Produkte, Dienstleistungen und Lösungen zu entwickeln und
12
einzuführen, und unser Forschungs- und Entwicklungsaufwand könnte erfolglos sein. Darüber hinaus
kann das Tempo des technologischen Wandels dazu führen, dass der wirtschaftliche Lebenszyklus einigerunserer Produkte kürzer ist als erwartet.
 Betriebliche Störungen in unseren Wertschöpfungsprozessen und Qualitätsprobleme könnten sich negativ
auf unser Geschäft und unsere Reputation auswirken und könnten zu Forderungen, Strafen undzusätzlichen Kosten führen.
 Wir sind von der Verfügbarkeit von gewissen Materialien, Teilen und Komponenten abhängig und
jegliche Störung der Lieferkette könnte zu zusätzlichen Kosten oder Umsatzverlusten führen.
 Unser Projektgeschäft ist verschiedenen Risiken, einschließlich Ausführungsrisiken,
Kostenüberschreitungen und Qualitäts- und politischen Risiken, ausgesetzt.
 Im Zusammenhang mit bestehenden und potentiellen zukünftigen Reorganisations- und
Kosteneinsparungsmaßnahmen können uns erhebliche Restrukturierungsaufwendungen undMittelabflüsse entstehen. Wir könnten möglicherweise nicht in der Lage sein, die erwartetenKosteneinsparungen zu realisieren oder unsere organisatorische und produktionstechnische Präsenzrechtzeitig oder überhaupt anzupassen. Solche Reorganisationen bringen möglicherweise nicht denangestrebten Nutzen oder könnten unseren Ruf schädigen.
 Wir müssen möglicherweise Vorräte oder andere Vermögenswerte abschreiben, was sich negativ auf
unsere finanzielle Position auswirken und zu Profitabilitätsverlusten führen könnte.
 Der Firmenwert ( Goodwill ) und andere immaterielle Vermögenswerte machen einen beträchtlichen Teil
unseres Gesamtvermögens aus, das erheblich reduziert werden könnte, wenn wir Wertminderungenverbuchen müssten.
 Unser Geschäft und die Geschäfte unserer Kunden und Lieferanten erfordern den Zugang zu
signifikanten Kredit- und Avalkreditlinien und anderen Finanzierungsinstrumenten. UnsereGeschäftsaktivitäten könnten negativ beeinflusst werden, wenn wir in Zukunft nicht in der Lage sind,unseren Kapitalbedarf zu decken, z.B. in einem schwachen Finanzmarktumfeld, als Folge einererheblichen Verschlechterung unserer Bonität, als Folge der Verletzung einer Vereinbarung über eineKreditfazilität oder wenn der Zugang zu Kapital teurer wird. Unsere Geschäftstätigkeiten könntenvergleichbar negativ betroffen sein, wenn unsere Kunden oder Lieferanten keinen Zugang zuFinanzierungen zu wirtschaftlich tragfähigen Bedingungen haben.
 Unser Gas and Power Segment und, in geringerem Maße, unser SGRE Segment könnten nach der
Trennung vom Siemens-Konzern Geschäftschancen verlieren und eine negative Wahrnehmung ihrereigenständigen Position erfahren. Darüber hinaus könnten wir als eigenständige Gruppe möglicherweisenicht in der Lage sein, die finanziellen oder technischen Anforderungen der Gesetze zum öffentlichenBeschaffungswesen zu erfüllen.

3 RISK FACTORS
In considering whether to invest in the shares (the “ Shares ”) of Siemens Energy AG (hereinafter
also the “ Company ”), investors should consider carefully the following risks, in addition to the
other information in this prospectus (the “ Prospectus ”). In this Prospectus, references to the
“Siemens Energy Group ”, the “ Group ”, “Siemens Energy ”, “we”, “us”o r“ our” are references
to the combined group of entities and business activities comprising the Siemens Energy business,with the Company acting as the ultimate holding company as from the completion of thespin-off for absorption (Abspaltung zur Aufnahme) under the German Transformation Act(Umwandlungsgesetz) (the “ Spin-Off ”, and its completion, the “ Spin-Off Completion ”). The risk
factors featured in the Prospectus are limited to risks which are specific to Siemens Energy or theshares in the Company and which are material for taking an informed investment decision. Themateriality of the risk factors has been assessed based on the probability of their occurrence andthe expected magnitude of their negative impact. The risk factors are presented in categoriesdepending on their nature. In each category the two most material risk factors are mentionedfirst according to the assessment based on the probability of their occurrence and the expectedmagnitude of their negative impact. The risks mentioned may materialize individually orcumulatively.
3.1 Risks Related to Our Industry
3.1.1 The energy market is subject to disruptive developments, such as the trend towards
decarbonization, and we may be too slow or even fail in adapting our businessmodel and product portfolio.
The products, solutions and services offered by our Gas and Power segment’s Generation and
Industrial Applications divisions serve, to a significant extent, conventional power generationusing fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. Fossil power generation is currently under pressure dueto the prevailing trend towards more sustainable power generation using renewable energysources (also referred to as “ renewables ”) or carbon-neutral fuels. To a certain extent, this holds
also true for nuclear power generation. This trend is impacted by several factors beyond ourcontrol, in particular by government intervention, public and private initiatives, the efficiencyand cost of renewable energy technologies, as well as selectiveness of and restrictions forinvestors and lenders and changing consumer preferences in energy consumption. Most of theseinterventions and initiatives are directed to limit global climate change. The transition pathwaystowards more sustainable power generation can vary by country or region.
There is a risk that the demand for fossil power plants and related infrastructure including highly
efficient gas turbines will be lower than we expect due to a faster than expected transitiontowards renewables. In other words, there is a risk that accelerated growth in new installationsof solar and wind power due to their declining levelized cost of energy could result in decreasingdemand for conventional power generation in some regions of the world. Such transition may bedriven by, among others, regulation, market design favoring renewable power generation or lesspolicies aimed at supporting investments into new firm power generation capacities based onfossil or carbon-neutral fuel. Also, a faster than expected development of competitive energystorage solutions could accelerate the change towards renewables by offsetting theirdisadvantage of not being able to respond flexibly to varying energy demands. Decarbonizationrequirements might result in increased costs for the oil & gas industry, limited access to financingand could have an adverse impact on the overall demand for oil and natural gas. As a result, thismay translate into lower investment volumes, in particular for oil & gas greenfield projects,thereby negatively affecting our industrial applications business. In addition, the trend towardsdecarbonization might force us to review our strategy, our organizational set-up, our portfolioand footprint.
If these developments result in fewer orders for new power plants, oil & gas products or
solutions, or other industrial applications, our service business might be affected insofar as there
16
are fewer opportunities to conclude new service contracts related to orders for new power
plants, equipment and solutions. Our service backlog may be affected if customers decide todecommission conventional power plants, other assets or to cancel or postpone modernizations.Our maintenance service business may be affected through a reduced number of full-load hoursof the conventional power plants or installed oil & gas assets due to less dispatch and ourcustomers could seek to renegotiate their long-term service contracts, which may result in lessvolume or less favorable conditions for us.
In addition, within renewables, we are offering wind power applications through our SGRE
segment (which comprises Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A., Zamudio, Spain, (“ SGRE
S.A.”) and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (“ SGRE ”)) but we have only limited products and
services related to solar power generation or other renewable technologies in our portfolio. Ifthe solar market or other renewable fields develop more dynamically than expected this mayhave a material adverse effect on our business (see” 3.1.8 The wind power industry faces
structural market changes, in particular declining subsidy levels, and there can be no guaranteethat Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy will succeed in addressing the resulting challenges. ”).
Also in this case, fewer orders could affect our service business.
Similarly, we are offering only limited products and services for nuclear power applications.
Should this market develop more dynamically than expected, we may miss businessopportunities.
Furthermore, we are offering our customers various pathways to transform their existing fleet of
fossil fuel-based power generation technology into a less carbon-intensive one. Depending ongovernmental policy support and regulatory implementation, such markets may pick up earlier orlater than expected. In addition, the trend towards decentralization may adversely impactmarkets for centralized power generation, including gas power plants and related power grids,e.g., high-voltage substations. If we are too slow or if we fail to adapt our business model and
our product portfolio to specific regional demand in time or at all, this may have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
3.1.2 We may fail to comply with environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards
and expectations which could adversely impact our business and reputation. At thesame time, compliance with certain ESG standards may pose additional challenges toour business.
We must increasingly meet environmental, social and governance (“ ESG”) standards and
expectations regarding environmental concerns ( e.g., climate change and sustainability), social
concerns ( e.g., diversity and human rights), and corporate governance concerns ( e.g., employee
relations when making business and investment decisions). We may not always be able toidentify and adequately assess the relevant concerns, which may result in failure to meet ESGstandards and expectations of stakeholders or the public, which could adversely impact ourreputation. At the same time, compliance with certain ESG standards, in particular environmentalstandards, may pose challenges to our business and lead to additional costs in our business.
In the wider context of ESG, there is a risk of insufficient funding or procurement of other
financing instruments and other financial services such as financing, securities, hedginginstruments or insurance provided by banks, insurance companies and other financial institutionsfor specific projects or our whole business operations due to financial institutions’ internal,industry-wide or policy-driven prerequisites for all dimensions of ESG. Examples are the new‘lending criteria’ of the European Investment Bank (“ EIB”) or the European Union’s (the “ EU”)
taxonomy for sustainable activities (see “ 3.3.4 Our business and the businesses of our customers
and suppliers require access to significant credit and guarantee lines and other financinginstruments. Our business activities could be negatively affected if we are unable to meet ourcapital requirements in the future, for example in weak financial market environments, as aresult of a significant deterioration of our credit standing or of a breach of a credit facilityagreement, or if access to capital becomes more expensive. Our business activities could be
17
similarly negatively affected if our customers or suppliers do not have access to financing on
economically viable terms .” below).
Our ability to realize projects in the energy industry, whether conventional or renewable, may be
negatively impacted by ESG standards. For example, we may be contributing technology for newcoal-fired power plants in Indonesia and we have been and may continue to be confronted withprotests against our participation in coal, oil and gas, nuclear or renewable projects from climate,environmental or other civil groups which, in particular if such protests receive extensive mediacoverage, could have an impact on the willingness of important stakeholders to contribute orsupport such projects, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financialposition, reputation and results of operations.
3.1.3 Our industries and business operations are subject to various risks relating to global
or local outbreaks of infectious diseases and other public health crises. In particular,we are affected from the fallout of the outbreak of the recent Coronavirus pandemic.
We are a globally active Group and, as such, directly and, through our customers and suppliers,
indirectly exposed to various risks arising out of or in relation to global and local spreads ofinfectious diseases, such as the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic (“ COVID-19 ”), or
other forms of public health crises. Risks stem not only from the immediate effect of such crisesbut also from any measures aimed at limiting their impact, including, but not limited to,restrictions on travel, imposition of quarantines, prolonged closures of workplaces, curfews orother social distancing measures, including the social impact of such measures. Such measuresmay be required by public health laws, imposed by public authorities on international, nationalor local level, required under best practices in our industries or implemented under our own orour customers’ or suppliers’ environmental, health and safety (“ EHS”) standards. COVID-19 has
already resulted in lockdowns and various levels of restrictions of movement being imposedglobally, including China, Germany, Italy, France, the United States of America (“ United States ”
or “U.S.”) and other countries where we sell our products, system solutions and services. The
restrictions include curtailing travel, closure of schools, prohibitions of mass gatherings andmandatory remote working. The extent to which global and local economies, the industries inwhich we are active in, our business operations and the business operation of our customers areaffected by public health crises depends on a number of factors. These factors include, but arenot limited to, the spread of diseases and the duration of outbreaks, timing, adequacy andeffectiveness of countermeasures imposed by public health laws or public authorities atinternational, national or local level and the level of civil compliance with such measures. Therecan be no guarantee that such measures, or a combination thereof, are effective means tocombat such an outbreak and the implications resulting therefrom. A continuing public healthcrisis due to the inefficiency of relevant measures as well as the effects of the countermeasuresthemselves may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position and results ofoperations.
In particular, we are subject to the following risks relating to such crises: the spread of infectious diseases among our workforce may adversely interrupt, and even
result in a shutdown of our production, our project sites, internal functions, and service andsales activities, particularly in the case of a high sickness rate or quarantines, which has resultedand could result in a loss of productivity. Social distancing according to public health laws orour EHS standards in factories, offices and sites has already led and may lead to inefficienciesor cost increases. Under such laws and standards, we may be required to temporarily suspendour activities, in particular the execution of our projects, which could materially adverselyaffect our internal processes and supply chains. On risks relating to EHS standards, see also“3.4.6 We are subject to environmental, health and safety as well as other regulatory
requirements and risks, as a result of which we may incur significant costs, liabilities andobligations. ”;
 similar risks affecting key suppliers and restrictions to the free transfer of goods and supplies
on which we depend have already led and may lead to supply chain disruptions and result in
18
shutdowns on our side, and we may not be able to fulfil our obligations towards our customers
in a timely manner (see also “ 3.2.4 We are dependent on the availability of certain materials,
parts and components, and any disruptions in the supply chain may result in additional costs orloss of revenues. ”). Our resulting inability to perform our contractual obligations may subject
us to claims of non-performance or damages;
 in addition to these risks, the imposition of travel restrictions may also adversely affect our
businesses, especially because we run global operations. For example, our service and projectbusinesses rely on our and our project partners’ and contractors’ ability to send personnelon-site and to provide installation and service capacities, the lack of which could result, e.g.,i n
service outages. The impact of public health crises and countermeasures in connection withCOVID-19 have already had and may continue to have detrimental effects on the execution ofour projects (see also “ 3.2.6 Our project business is subject to several risks, including execution
risks, cost overruns, quality and political risks.”) and may also cause our customers to defer
investments or payments, which may lead to a lower order intake and deferred or lowerrevenue recognition and cash flow;
 the impact of public health crises such as COVID-19 could have severe effects on global and
national economies and even lead to a prolonged recession and an increased global debt level,adversely affecting demand for our offerings;
 certain global and national initiatives and governments have called for post-COVID-19 stimulus
packages to combat impending recession with a focus on accelerating the shift towards a moresustainable energy production through directed investments. If such stimulus packages wereadopted, this could impair the prospects of industries such as the oil & gas industry and,consequently, adversely affect demand for certain offerings of our Gas and Power segment(see also “ 3.1.1 The energy market is subject to disruptive developments, such as the trend
towards decarbonization, and we may be too slow or even fail in adapting our business modeland product portfolio. ”);
 the fallout from COVID-19 may lead to a tougher business environment and has prompted
corporations to draw-down liquidity from banks and issue financing requests, resulting insubstantial strain on banks’ balance sheets and regulatory indicators and metrics. In addition,capital markets financing and other funding sources have become highly volatile andexpensive. Such effects could increase financing costs and re-financing risks for us, ourcustomers and suppliers and may result in customers deferring or canceling plannedinvestments, leading to less demand for our offering, or could also lead to requests for therenegotiation of contracts or for deferrals of payments by our customers. Our customers orsuppliers may also face financial difficulties or even insolvencies and banks themselves mayface liquidity and refinancing challenges that could result in limited access to or increasingcosts to obtain financing products and other financial services (see also “ 3.3.4 Our business and
the businesses of our customers and suppliers require access to significant credit and guaranteelines and other financing instruments. Our business activities could be negatively affected if weare unable to meet our capital requirements in the future, for example in weak financialmarket environments, as a result of a significant deterioration of our credit standing or of abreach of a credit facility agreement, or if access to capital becomes more expensive. Ourbusiness activities could be similarly negatively affected if our customers or suppliers do nothave access to financing on economically viable terms. ”).
Global or local spreads of infectious diseases and measures aimed at limiting their impact could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations andsuch effects would be greater if various risks, including potential quarantines, suspensions ofbusiness operations, travel restrictions and their general effects on the business environmentstook effect simultaneously.
As of the date of this Prospectus, there is significant uncertainty relating to the severity of the
near- and long-term adverse impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and the global financialmarkets, and we are unable to accurately predict the near-term or long-term impact of COVID-19on our business.

3.1.4 Competition and lower market prices could negatively affect our business, financial
position and results of operations.
The worldwide markets for our products, solutions and services are highly competitive. Factors
such as pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time,customer relationships, financing terms and the ability to quickly adapt to shifts in marketdemands play an important role in our highly competitive market environments. For example,more recently, governments in some of our SGRE segment’s key markets are moving away fromfixed support regimes for renewable energy generation towards market-based auction modelswhere a number of competing developers are submitting bids for projects, with awards beingmade based on the lowest entry price and the lowest level of incentives required for the project.We face strong established competitors and rising competitors from emerging markets, wheremany competitors have developed their offerings locally and are now expanding globally, andcompetitors from new industries such as digital industries, which may offer more advancedproducts or solutions or have a better cost structure. Some industry fields in which we operateare undergoing consolidation, which may result in stronger competitors or a change in ourrelative market position. Decreasing demand for our offerings as a result of a weaker marketposition could lead to increases in inventory of finished or work-in-progress goods or unexpectedprice erosion.
Globally, contractors, which offer turnkey power plant solutions using components from
different suppliers to optimize costs, contribute to price decreases. Similarly, customers who arefacing increasingly fierce competition ( e.g., from the renewable energy industry or new price
determination processes such as auctions) often pass on the price pressure to their originalequipment manufacturer (“ OEM ”) suppliers such as the Group. Reduced demand for our
products might also lead to additional overcapacities of OEM suppliers putting additionalpressure on profitability. In our service business, we face competition from major establishedplayers and non-OEM suppliers targeting, in particular, our turbine service business, which is amajor source of profitable revenue. This risk is further exacerbated by the fact that we grant thenon-exclusive right to certain companies to manufacture, sell and service certain of our productsin specific territories, or to use certain of our intellectual property or design tools to developtheir own product. These agreements are based on the assumption that it is beneficial to us if weare active in these markets via a partner. Should we subsequently decide to directly serve therespective market, we may be forced to compete with our partner. In our Transmission division,emerging Asian competitors pose the greatest challenges as they continuously enter new marketsand increase their competitiveness through market consolidation. Our SGRE segment may in thefuture face additional competition from Chinese manufacturers that may decide to enter globalwind turbine markets, which may result in price decreases and a loss of market share for ourSGRE segment.
Some of these developments may prompt us to revise our strategy and product portfolio and
there can be no assurance that such revisions yield the targeted results. If the Group is unable tocompete effectively against its competitors or achieve satisfactory prices in negotiations withcustomers, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and resultsof operations.
3.1.5 Adverse changes of certain external economic factors may negatively affect our
business, financial position and results of operations.
If the macroeconomic conditions of the economies in which we operate deteriorate, our business
may be negatively affected. For example, an actual or expected deterioration of macroeconomicconditions could lead to our customers modifying, delaying or canceling plans to purchase ourproducts, solutions and services, or they may fail to follow through on purchases or contractsalready executed. For the same reasons, the prices that are achievable for our products, solutionsand services may decline to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. In addition, it maybecome more difficult for our customers to obtain financing, including project financing andsecurities. Furthermore, we are active in oil & gas projects, grid-related projects and powergeneration projects, including wind power projects. The projects business typically requiressubstantial investments, for which our customers generally need to obtain financing, including
20
project financing, securities or other financing. Our customers’ financing may also involve
external financing from international investors and lenders as well as the availability of exportcredit agencies’ (“ ECAs ”) support. The availability and terms of financing for our customers,
including in particular, interest rates for such financing have already partially deteriorated inlight of the COVID-19 outbreak and may continue to do so. The availability of credit support byECAs generally has a significant influence on whether and when customers and their lendingbanks will proceed with the development of such projects and thus utilizing our products,solutions and services. In particular, large projects may become increasingly difficult to financeand subject to stricter requirements. In addition, customers could request to move agreedpayment dates, which could negatively impact our financial position. Additionally, customersmay increasingly request more business models focusing on operational expenditure where wereceive payments distributed over a timeframe of several years while the majority of our costarise up front, which would add strain to our balance sheet.
If macroeconomic conditions deteriorate, including an adverse development of financing
conditions and reduced credit support for our customers, we could face reduced demand for ouroffering, which could in particular affect our project business and have a material adverse effecton our business, financial position and results of operations.
3.1.6 Political instability, international conflicts or new trade barriers may have a negative
effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
Our business prospects and the execution of projects awarded to us may be negatively affected
by political instability or international conflicts. For example, we may be forced to reorganize,reduce or terminate business operations in geographical areas where our employees, partners orsubcontractors would otherwise be subject to unacceptable economic or personal risks, e.g., due
to ongoing or threatened civil unrest, terror attacks or war. Some of our current and plannedprojects and service activities are in regions, which are exposed to a higher risk in this respect,e.g., in Libya, Iraq and other countries. Furthermore, our business prospects or the execution of
our order backlog may be negatively affected by changes in the political and economicframework, e.g., due to trade wars, punitive tariffs, sanctions, protectionist measures, boycotts or
economic weakness of economies or industries.
In 2018, Siemens signed the memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Electricity in
Iraq to implement the five-year “Iraq Roadmap”, including the expansion of transmission anddistribution networks. In 2019, we signed an implementation agreement with the IraqiGovernment to start the execution of this roadmap. The first phase of the roadmap includescontracts valued around €700 million. Project execution, and thus recognition of any revenues
from this project, is still subject to a number of conditions precedent. Factors which may result innonfulfillment of these conditions precedent include government intervention, terrorist activity,violent conflicts, regional instability, including armed conflicts between Iran and the UnitedStates and increasing tensions between Iraq and the United States. For example, on January 5,2020, the President of the United States threatened to impose sanctions on Iraq if the Iraqigovernment forces U.S. troops to withdraw from the country on unfriendly terms. If the U.S.administration pursues such action it is unclear at this time what specific measures, if any, mightbe adopted or implemented. Since 2018, the United States have granted a series of waivers toIraq to continue purchasing electricity and natural gas from Iran. If the U.S. administrationdecides to not renew these waivers or imposes some form of sanctions or other restrictivemeasures concerning Iraq, or if regional instability and violent conflicts in the region escalate, itcould have negative implications for our local business and prevent us from executing ourcontracts in Iraq which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our inability to perform our contractual obligations may subject us to claims for
non-performance or damages. We may not be able to exploit new business opportunities, whichmay result in the loss of revenue. Furthermore, a cessation or reduction of our business mayenable our competitors to take over business from us, and there can be no assurance that we willbe able to win back such business or opportunities if the relevant sanctions are lifted.
21
As we are a globally operating group, the imposition of new barriers to free trade would
negatively impact production costs and productivity along our value chains. In addition, newbarriers to trade may reduce the level of investment activity and cause supply chain disruptions(see also “ 3.2.4 We are dependent on the availability of certain materials, parts and components,
and any disruptions in the supply chain may result in additional costs or loss of revenues. ”), which
could severely affect our business. We believe a key risk in this regard is the simmering U.S.-Chinatrade conflict which may escalate into a global trade war. In the U.S.-China trade conflict, eachcountry has recently imposed tariffs on the other country’s products. As we have significantbusiness in the U.S. and in China, we are exposed to potential new trade barriers which mayimpede our business with China and the U.S. Also, our operations outside China and the U.S.could be affected due to potential supply chain disruptions as a consequence of such a tradeconflict. In particular, several components for our SGRE segment’s products are manufactured inChina and the U.S.-China trade conflict may have a negative impact on our SGRE segment’sbusiness including interruptions of its product manufacturing processes, delays in delivering itsproducts, claims for damages and our SGRE segment may not be able to replace its Chinesesuppliers in time or at economically reasonable costs. Our SGRE segment may also find itincreasingly difficult to sell its products that are subject to additional tariffs in the Chinesemarket at a competitive price or at all. Furthermore, the consequences of the United Kingdom(“UK”) withdrawing from the EU (so-called “ Brexit ”) remain unclear. Although the UK ceased to
be an EU member on January 31, 2020, the trading relationship is expected to remain the sameuntil December 31, 2020. Negotiations determining the conditions of the future tradingrelationship between the EU and the UK are currently ongoing. If the EU and the UK fail toconclude a trading framework which provides for trading terms substantially similar to thecurrent terms, this may materially adversely affect our business operations and results.
The realization of any significant adverse political developments, in particular with regard to
continued sanctions relief for Iraq and trade relationships between economic powers, could havea material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
3.1.7 Some of our customers may be affected by long-term low oil prices or long-term low
demand for oil and gas which could result in a reduced demand for certain of ourofferings which in turn could negatively affect our profitability.
Demand for certain of our products, systems solutions and services, in particular for elements of
our Gas and Power segment, is to a certain degree affected by oil and gas prices and demand foroil and gas. Since oil and gas prices are set on a commodity basis, spot market and futures marketprices and their volatility, as well as storage capacities, impact the business activities of ourcustomers from relevant industries and their investment behavior. Historically, prices for crudeoil, refined products, natural gas and petrochemical products have fluctuated widely in responseto changes in many factors over which we do not and will not have control and which aredifficult to predict. On the one hand, in the event of long-term low or volatile oil and gas pricesor when such prices are expected to be low for a longer period in the future, our customerswhose activities in the oil & gas industry primarily depend on profitability may postponeinvestments, affecting demand for certain parts of our offerings such as compressors, industrialgas turbines, subsea products or other oil & gas products and solutions. Customers might alsoseek to renegotiate their contracts, which may lead to disadvantageous contract terms for us, ashas happened to a certain degree in the past. Long-term low oil prices may eventually lead topartial or full defaults on payments from our customers, as has happened to a certain degree inthe past during longer periods of low oil and gas prices. On the other hand, long-term highprices for oil and gas could cause an overall economic recession.
Certain countries that are heavily dependent on income from oil and gas may curtail investments
in capital intensive oil and gas, as well as power generation and transmission projects duringperiods of long-term low or expected low demand for oil and gas due to insufficient funds,which in turn could lead to less demand for certain of our Gas and Power segment’s products,solutions and services.
22
Furthermore, we may be unable to adjust our personnel and functional footprint to adapt to
demand swings caused by changes in oil and gas prices and/or changes in oil and gas demand fastenough, which may result in under- or overcapacities (see also “ 3.2.11 In connection with existing
and potential future reorganization and cost savings measures, we may incur substantialrestructuring expenses and cash outflows. We may not be able to realize expected cost savings orwe may fail to adjust our organizational and manufacturing footprint in a timely manner or atall, and such reorganizations may not yield the targeted benefits or may damage ourreputation. ”).
Long-term low or volatile oil and gas prices may put pressure on power generation from
renewables in the SGRE segment and on the growth of our green hydrogen business due tolower power generation costs for fossil fuel-based generation, which may prompt our customersto revisit planned projects.
Longer periods of low demand for our products, solutions and services from markets affected by
oil and gas prices and demand for oil and gas could eventually result in us having to record assetimpairments in our Gas and Power segment.
Any significant adverse developments, including sustained low prices and volatility, in oil and gas
markets could reduce customers’ demand for the Group’s products, particularly in our Gas andPower segment, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial positionand results of operations.
3.1.8 The wind power industry faces structural market changes, in particular declining
subsidy levels, and there can be no guarantee that Siemens Gamesa RenewableEnergy will succeed in addressing the resulting challenges.
Our SGRE segment is active in the wind power industry, providing products, solutions and
services for onshore and offshore wind power plants. Historically, this industry has benefittedfrom various direct and indirect subsidies aimed at facilitating wind energy production, e.g.,
economically favorable feed-in tariffs. In recent years, in most of our SGRE segment’s markets,governments have already reduced or withdrawn direct subsidies for wind power and in theUnited States, production tax credits (another form of support) generated by wind energy will becompletely phased out for projects commencing construction after 2020. Similar support schemesmay continue to be significantly reduced or phased out entirely in other jurisdictions in thefuture. Further, the expansion of onshore and offshore wind power plants and renewables is alsodependent on adequate development in other adjacent areas such as national infrastructure(such as transmission networks) (see also “ 3.4.3 The markets in which we and our customers
operate are subject to several regulatory requirements which are subject to change. ”). In
addition, demand for wind power equipment is affected by the cost of wind-generated electricitycompared to the cost of electricity generated from other sources of energy, including not onlyrenewable sources (principally solar and hydroelectric power), but also gas, coal and nuclear-fueled power generation. With a drive in many countries for diversification of energy sources,modern biomass, geothermal, tidal and biofuels, as well as nuclear power, all compete forgovernmental support and a prioritized focus. Even though the levelized cost of wind-generatedelectricity is decreasing as wind turbine design, production and installation continue to makeimprovements in cost, efficiency, output and capacity factor (number of full-load hours),competitiveness of wind power technology against other renewable and conventional powergeneration technologies might deteriorate due to technological advances, declining carbonprices or declining fossil commodity prices.
Furthermore, our SGRE segment experiences competitive pressure among wind turbine
manufacturers, which have themselves contributed significantly to a reduction of prices for windturbine generators and may result in additional price pressure. Competition in the wind powerindustry has intensified due to factors such as the expansion of existing industry participants innew markets and increasing pressure from Asian manufacturers who strive to improve the qualityand reliability of their technologies and move out of their local markets. In particular in certainmarkets (mostly emerging markets) in which customers’ access to capital is restricted, successfully
23
marketing SGRE products may be challenging, because certain customers in these markets are
more focused on price per megawatt than on the levelized cost of energy (full-cycle cost) orsimilar parameters. In these cases, the customers’ pressure on pricing of capital expendituresrather than efficiency may affect our SGRE segment’s competitiveness. In addition, market entryby certain large industrial groups, including those previously not engaged in the wind powersector, as well as the continuous consolidation of the industry, which is leading to greater marketpower and economies of scale by certain players, who are able to offer greater costs of energy-savings to customers, also pose new competition risks.
If SGRE does not succeed at navigating the structural market changes brought on by, among
others, reduction in subsidies and additional competition, this could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
3.1.9 Extreme weather conditions due to climate change may have a negative effect on
our business.
Climate change is leading to warmer weather and more extreme weather conditions. Therefore,
climate change could affect our business and have a significant impact on Siemens Energy, mostlikely in the medium- and long-term. Longer and warmer seasons or extreme cold couldmaterially affect the operations of our customers and limit the attractiveness of our products.Severe weather, such as fires, hurricanes, high winds and seas, blizzards and extremetemperatures may cause evacuation of personnel, curtailment of services and suspension ofoperations, inability to deliver materials to job sites in accordance with contract schedules, loss ofor damage to equipment and facilities, supply chain disruption and reduced productivity. Forexample, our SGRE segment had to adjust its profitability target in January 2020 followingunforeseen costs in a low triple-digit million euro amount relating to five onshore projects (1.1GW) in northern Europe, mainly Norway, caused by adverse road conditions and the unusualearly arrival of winter weather, which delayed project execution substantially.
3.2 Risks Related to Our Business
3.2.1 We may not be able to successfully implement our strategies; in particular we may
fail to successfully complete cost savings and other reorganization programs, benefitfrom the disruptive trends in global energy markets and increase the share of ourservice business.
Our future operational performance and financial position depends to a significant degree on
the success of the strategic and operational measures we plan to implement or are currentlyimplementing. In particular, our strategy comprises the following elements:
 We have already initiated various reorganization and cost savings programs that we will
continue to pursue. In addition, we are currently evaluating further potential options toimprove our profitability, such as project excellence measures, streamlining of our portfolio,footprint adjustments as well as re-sizing of functions. There is a risk that we may incursubstantial costs and cash outflows when implementing such programs and there can be noguarantee that they will yield the targeted benefits (see also “ 3.2.11 In connection with
existing and potential future reorganization and cost savings measures, we may incursubstantial restructuring expenses and cash outflows. We may not be able to realize expectedcost savings or we may fail to adjust our organizational and manufacturing footprint in atimely manner or at all, and such reorganizations may not yield the targeted benefits or maydamage our reputation. ”).
 We seek to benefit from the disruptive trends in global energy markets, namely demand
growth, decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization and there can be no guaranteethat we will be able to adapt our business model in time or at all (see also “ 3.1.1 The energy
market is subject to disruptive developments, such as the trend towards decarbonization, andwe may be too slow or even fail in adapting our business model and product portfolio. ”).
While we aim to focus our research and development spending on growing market segmentsand products that we expect to offer a sustainable competitive advantage, there can be no
24
guarantee that our research and development spending will deliver the targeted economic
benefits (see also “ 3.2.2 We may be unable to successfully develop and launch a portfolio of
competitive and technologically-advanced products, services and solutions, and our researchand development efforts may be unsuccessful. Furthermore, the pace of technological changemay result in the economic life cycle of certain of our products being shorter thananticipated.”). There is also a risk that such shift in focus in our research and developmentspending will lead to a decline of our competitive position in our traditional core portfolio.
 We seek to grow the share of our service business in our business mix, which has typically
higher margins than the products, systems and solutions businesses. Should we fail to increasesuch share, we may fail to achieve our profitability improvement targets. There is a risk that areduction in operating hours of the equipment provided by our Generation and IndustrialApplications divisions may lead to lower service and modernization demand from ourcustomers (see also “ 3.1.1 The energy market is subject to disruptive developments, such as the
trend towards decarbonization, and we may be too slow or even fail in adapting our businessmodel and product portfolio. ”). We may face more competition in our service business as
digital technologies and additive manufacturing continue to allow competitors to service ourinstalled base at a competitive cost/price level. For the SGRE segment’s service business, there isa risk that wind farm operators will service their own fleet themselves or engage third-partyservice providers (see also “ 3.1.4 Competition and lower market prices could negatively affect
our business, financial position and results of operations. ”).
 We have set ourselves certain goals to optimize the allocation of our resources, streamline our
portfolio and increase our performance. Among others, we seek to further reducenon-conformance costs in our project and product business (see also “ 3.2.6 Our project business
is subject to several risks, including execution risks, cost overruns, quality and political risks.”
and “ 3.2.3 Operational failures in our value chain processes and quality issues could negatively
affect our business and reputation, and result in claims, penalties and additional costs. ”). We
are also targeting an improvement in our cash conversion rate ( i.e., free cash flow divided by
adjusted EBITA), including by stricter working capital management, reducing costs resultingfrom organizational complexity, footprint adjustments and strict return criteria for capitalexpenditure and acquisitions. We are planning to reduce complexity and risks in our solutionbusinesses by limiting our exposure in Engineering, Procurement and Construction (“ EPC”)
activities. There is a risk that this may lead to a lower pull-through of products and have anegative bearing on capacity utilization in our factories.
 Our SGRE segment is in the process of realigning its strategy to the current market
environment and is implementing corresponding programs to improve profitability.
The achievement of targeted improvements of our performance depends not only on the
successful implementation of such measures but also on other developments, for example inrelation to the market environment, including market prices for our products, solutions andservices and cost increases, including costs for raw materials and components, which may bebeyond our control (see also “ 3.2.4 We are dependent on the availability of certain materials,
parts and components, and any disruptions in the supply chain may result in additional costs orloss of revenues. ”). Furthermore, the assumptions underlying our planning could prove to be
incorrect or may need to be revised in the future. In any such case, our strategy may not yield thetargeted improvements.
3.2.2 We may be unable to successfully develop and launch a portfolio of competitive and
technologically-advanced products, services and solutions, and our research anddevelopment efforts may be unsuccessful. Furthermore, the pace of technologicalchange may result in the economic life cycle of certain of our products being shorterthan anticipated.
We may not be successful in developing a portfolio of technologically-advanced products,
services and solutions within the expected timeframe or at all, or at prices that allow our new
25
developments to be competitive when compared to similar products, services and solutions
available in the market.
As evidenced by recently introduced digital offerings, such as the Sensformer and Sensgear
applications of our Transmission division, Omnivise digital services for applications of our Gas andPower segment’s divisions, the Topsides 4.0 and Pipelines 4.0 solutions offered by our IndustrialApplications division, we are constantly investing time and money in the digitization of ourportfolio. However, such investments may not translate into profitable business, or we may betoo slow or less successful than our industry peers, or new digital players who could become newcompetitors, in the field of digital offerings related to our products.
The markets in which we operate experience rapid and significant changes due to the
introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies. Our operating results have in the pastdepended and will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to meet the evolvingneeds of current and prospective customers, our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in ourmarkets and to optimize our cost base accordingly. Optimizing the levelized cost of energy of itsproducts and its cost base is particularly important for our SGRE segment as many of its productsare subject to significant price pressure. Furthermore, in the area of electric energy storage, weface the risk that competitors’ energy storage solutions are more cost effective than our own. Inaddition, storage solutions may in the future reduce demand for peaker applications of our gasturbine product lines. Even if we succeed in developing innovative technologies, our competitorsmay be able to commercialize similar technologies faster or more successfully than us.Introducing new products and technologies requires a significant commitment to research anddevelopment, which in return requires expenditure of considerable financial resources that maynot always lead to successful new developments. Our results of operations may suffer if we investin the development of technologies that may not operate or may not be integrated as expected.Technologies may not be accepted in the marketplace as anticipated. In addition, our products,solutions or systems may fail to be introduced into the market in a timely manner, particularlywhen compared to our competitors, or even become obsolete, negatively impacting our resultsof operations. For example, there can be no assurance that the new gas turbine class that we arecurrently developing will enable us to compete against the offerings of our competitors withtop-of-the-market efficiency levels, which are a key selling point for our customers. Since ourservice revenues depend to a large extent on our installed base of rotating equipment, fewerthan expected operating hours or lower sales of rotating equipment, such as turbines, may erodethe base of our future service revenues. In addition, our SGRE segment’s onshore productcompetitiveness could suffer if its portfolio optimization plans encounter delays or its productsmay fail to meet market expectations. Furthermore, in anticipation of EU legislation potentiallyrestricting or banning the use of Sulphur hexafluoride (“ SF
6”), a greenhouse gas (“ GHG ”)
commonly used in gas-insulated switchgear, we have developed an SF6-free gas-insulated
switchgear using compressed synthetic air. Demand for our innovative switchgear solution hasalready picked up following a restriction or ban of SF
6. However, some of our competitors have
opted to develop alternatives using other gases, which may prove more successful than ourtechnology.
Sector coupling and “power-to-x” technologies expand our field of activity in sectors beyond
power generation, e.g., for green synthetic fuels (so-called “e-fuels”). It remains a risk that these
markets do not materialize to a relevant size and we may not be able to recoup our investments.Furthermore, we may not be able to acquire the required technical competence, to successfullydevelop projects and operate facilities for such solutions and technologies or to achievecompetitive cost levels.
Moreover, the pace of technological change may result in the economic life cycle of certain of
our products, in particular wind turbine models, being shorter than anticipated. For example,these structural market changes put pressure on the established business model of wind turbineproviders such as our SGRE segment, and SGRE may fail to adapt its business model in time or atall.
26
We routinely apply for new patents and actively manage our intellectual property (“ IP”) portfolio
in an effort to secure proprietary technologies. However, our patents and other IP may notprevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services that aresimilar to, or virtually duplicates of, ours. In addition, we have been pursuing a more selectivestrategy in recent years when filing for new patents, which is aimed at reducing costs while atthe same time adequately protecting our innovations. This approach resulted in an increase inthe efforts required to defend against third-party IP rights and other measures to mitigate risksrelating to IP rights. If we fail to strike an adequate balance between cost reduction and anadequate level of protection, we might not have the portfolio of IP rights required to becompetitive. This risk is further exacerbated by our activities in the area of additivemanufacturing.
3.2.3 Operational failures in our value chain processes and quality issues could negatively
affect our business and reputation, and result in claims, penalties and additionalcosts.
Our value chains comprise all steps in the product life cycle, from research and development to
supply chain management, production, marketing, sales and services. Failures in our value chainprocesses could, among other things, result in quality, product safety or occupational safetyissues. Such risks are particularly present in our engineering, production and manufacturingfacilities, which are located all over the world and have a high degree of organizational andtechnological complexity.
Certain products that we sold in the past had, and may in the future have, quality issues resulting
from the design or manufacture of these products or the commissioning of these products or thesoftware integrated into them. In case of software, quality issues may also manifest themselves interms of vulnerability to cyberattacks or other forms of disruptions (see “ 3.2.5 We depend on the
continuous efficient performance of our information technology systems, which may be subjectto cyberattacks and other disruptions. In addition, we sell products and systems with digitalcapabilities and offer digital solutions, which may be vulnerable to such attacks or disruptions.Any such attack or disruption may adversely affect our business operation, compromise theconfidentiality and integrity of data, and may result in administrative sanctions, civil liability andadversely affect our reputation .”). A failure or malfunction of one of our products may extend to
other products, or affect whole production facilities or plants, resulting in consequentialdamages significantly exceeding the value of the failing or malfunctioning product and mightcause bodily harm. These risks are particularly relevant in the area of gas turbines, steamturbines, generators, auxiliary items and compressors, including the required spare parts for suchproducts, or the transmission product business. In connection with the introduction of newtechnology or of main components for wind turbines, e.g., blades and bearings, this risk is
particularly pronounced. For example, quality problems related to gas turbine parts could affectan entire product line of gas turbines which may already be installed or planned to be installedat customer sites. This could result in, e.g., a shutdown of power plants, delays in project
commissioning, significant costs for fixing the quality problem and replacing or repairing defectparts. For example, in a few instances customers alleged that a certain type of bushings, which isno longer manufactured by us, had failed due to quality issues. Although our investigations didnot reveal defects, we have settled a number of cases in which customers pursued legal actionagainst us, and it cannot be ruled out that further customers pursue claims against us in relationto these bushings. As an example, with respect to our SGRE segment, failures of wind turbinegenerators could impact, and have already impacted, parts of our entire wind power plants.Similarly, and related to new technologies, the electrolyzer technology (such as the ProtonExchange Membrane (PEM) technology) is still in an early phase of implementation and, becauseoperational data is rare, the lifetime of relevant products, systems and solutions cannot bereliably predicted. It is also possible that, due to technological problems, certain components inthe existing fleet may not reach the expected lifetime, and the profitability in current or futureprojects may deteriorate.
27
In addition, if we fail to meet agreed specifications, technical requirements or guarantees for our
products, solutions or services, particularly in the context of contract bids or under existingcontracts relating to certain technical performance parameters, we may incur additional costs(including significant non-conformance costs) and face claims for specific performance anddamages. Any such cases could, in addition, have particularly detrimental consequences for ourreputation.
There is no guarantee that our quality assurance measures will be effective enough to detect and
adequately respond to every quality assurance issue in a timely manner or at all. Even if suchmeasures work as intended, responding to quality issues may result in significant additional costsif quality issues arise that affect the installed fleet or sold new units of a product line. Forexample, as reliability of rotating equipment is particularly critical in the power generation andthe oil & gas industry, any quality issue arising in connection with our rotating equipment couldhave significant effects on electricity generation and oil & gas production or processing, result inpersonal injury, property damage and environmental impairments, and lead to claims fordamages, including consequential damages, or could negatively affect our reputation, specificallyif we have to issue product warnings or similar communication to our customers or to the public.
Depending on our footprint strategy, we may also face quality issues due to outsourcing of the
production of key components and there may be cases in which our suppliers do not comply withour technical specifications or quality management systems.
If the Group were to be subject to any claims, liabilities, fines or other adverse actions by
customers or governments ( e.g., claims based on warranty, guarantee or product liability), this
could expose us to reputational damage, significant additional costs and negatively affect theperformance of new projects and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business,financial position and results of operations.
3.2.4 We are dependent on the availability of certain materials, parts and components, and
any disruptions in the supply chain may result in additional costs or loss of revenues.
The financial performance of our operating units depends on reliable and effective supply chain
management for components, sub-assemblies and materials. Capacity constraints and supplyshortages resulting from ineffective supply chain management may lead to productionbottlenecks, delivery delays and additional costs. We also rely on third parties to supply us withparts, components and services. Using third parties to manufacture, assemble and test ourproducts may reduce our control over manufacturing yields, quality assurance, product deliveryschedules and costs. Unanticipated increases in the price of components or raw materials due tomarket shortages or other reasons could also adversely affect performance.
Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid supply-related problems, there can be no
assurance that we will not encounter supply problems. Especially where we use single-source or asmall number of suppliers for critical components, including, after Spin-Off Completion, fromSiemens Aktiengesellschaft, Munich and Berlin, Germany (“ Siemens AG ”) or its direct and
indirect subsidiaries (together with Siemens AG, the “ Siemens Group ”o r“ Siemens ”), any
business or relationship interruptions could harm our operations or increase our operating costs.For example, Siemens will continue to supply key components and software for control systemswhich are used in several of our products and solutions and which cannot be replaced withreadily available third-party components. Shortages and delays could materially harm ourbusinesses. These and similar market dynamics may also make it more difficult for us to findalternative sources of supply at reasonable costs or at all. Moreover, in the past, we haveexperienced supply chain constraints regarding blades and vanes required for the operation ofour turbines. Due to the expected low demand for turbines and the accompanying price pressure,our suppliers may seek customers from other industries and, thus, the overall number of ourpotential suppliers may be reduced. Such constraints can, for example, lead to delays or theinability to deliver spare parts. This in turn may affect our ability to perform our contractualobligations, which may subject us to claims of non-performance or damages.
28
In addition, many of the parts we require for the manufacturing of our products need to
undergo a qualification process, which may take longer than expected, for example, as a result ofthe increasing complexity of our turbine blades, vanes and electrolyzers. We may also experiencedelays in launching new technology components into the market, resulting in potential loss ofupgrade revenues.
Furthermore, we are exposed to the risk of delays and interruptions in the supply chain because
of catastrophic events, including adverse weather conditions, fire or pandemics or epidemics,such as COVID-19. The latter has resulted in the temporary closure of some of our sites. Inaddition, cyber incidents or suppliers’ financial difficulties or insolvencies can cause supply chaindisruptions, particularly if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply or means oftransportation in a timely manner or at all. Interruptions in the supply chain may lead toconsequential risks, which are particularly relevant for the execution of large projects. The needto seek alternative sources of supply may also arise if our competitors acquire critical suppliers.
The realization of any such planning miscalculations, disruptions or other unexpected
developments within the supply chain could significantly increase costs and have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
3.2.5 We depend on the continuous efficient performance of our information technology
systems, which may be subject to cyberattacks and other disruptions. In addition, wesell products and systems with digital capabilities and offer digital solutions, whichmay be vulnerable to such attacks or disruptions. Any such attack or disruption mayadversely affect our business operation, compromise the confidentiality and integrityof data, and may result in administrative sanctions, civil liability and adversely affectour reputation.
Information technologies (“ IT”) are deeply integrated into our business portfolio, and we depend
on their uninterrupted and efficient functioning. In addition, we rely on third-party IT serviceproviders. We observe a global increase of cybersecurity threats and higher levels ofprofessionalism in cybercrime, which pose a risk to the security of products, systems and networksand the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Our IT environment could becompromised, e.g., by attacks on our own or our IT service providers’ networks that may also
include cloud services, social engineering, data manipulations in critical applications and a loss ofcritical resources. In the past, successful cyberattacks on industrial companies were conductedusing social engineering which resulted in the loss of significant financial funds or the facilitationof money laundering, e.g., by payment frauds or the manipulation of master data. There can be
no assurance that our own or our IT service providers’ measures aimed at safeguarding theuninterrupted and efficient functioning of IT will address these threats under all circumstances.Any such attack or disruption may adversely affect our business operations. Risks fromcyberattacks on our products and services can have particularly serious consequences becausethey are often part of critical infrastructure whose limited functionality or total failure can havefar-reaching consequences.
In addition, there is a risk that confidential or private information, including third-party
information, may be leaked, stolen or manipulated or compromised in other ways, including dueto any of the events mentioned above. Leakage or theft of information about our IP rights couldaffect our competitive position and results of operations. If confidential or private information iscompromised, we may also be subject to contractual penalties or claims for damages (see also“3.2.3 Operational failures in our value chain processes and quality issues could negatively affect
our business and reputation, and result in claims, penalties and additional costs. ”), administrative
fines or other sanctions under secrecy, confidentiality, or data protection laws and regulations.
Cyberattacks and other disruptions could also result in deliberate improper access, and use, of
our sites or systems, as well as production downtimes and supply shortages, with potentialadverse effects on our reputation, our competitiveness and results of operations.
Furthermore, we sell products and systems with digital capabilities and offer digital solutions,
e.g., for remote operation of assets or onsite operations such as instrumentation & controls for
29
power plants. We frequently partner with early stage companies, such as start ups, to provide
cybersecurity offerings and may be exposed to risks relating to the long-term viability of suchcompanies, in particular where we have sold products to customers with multi-year contracts. Ifsuch products, systems and solutions are compromised or disrupted, including due to any of theevents described above, we may be held liable by our customers for damages, includingconsequential damages and may also suffer damage to our reputation.
These risks are further exacerbated by the fact that our potential attackers are increasingly
sophisticated and often supported by organized crime or even nation-states engaged ineconomic espionage or even sabotage.
If the Group were to suffer losses due to IT system failures, the leakage or theft of data,
inadequate IT system protection or insufficiently integrated IT systems, this could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
3.2.6 Our project business is subject to several risks, including execution risks, cost
overruns, quality and political risks.
We regularly engage in large and complex projects which may be worth, or even exceed a value
of, several hundred million euros and whose execution may take several years. Such projects areawarded on a competitive bidding basis and in many cases, we are responsible for the design andconstruction of an entire turnkey plant project, including wind power plants. Some of thesecontracts are inherently risky because we may assume substantially all risks associated withcompleting a project and meeting post-completion warranty obligations. For example, we haveto satisfy increasingly complex technical and regulatory requirements and we face the risk thatwe do not fully consider all such requirements in our offer. This is particularly true in projectswith untested or new technology that have never been executed before, or when we bid forprojects in countries where we have no or only limited experience from previous projects. Theprofit margins realized on fixed-priced contracts may vary from original estimates as a result ofchanges in costs and productivity over the contracts’ terms.
In certain cases, we bear the risk of unanticipated project modifications, shortage of key
personnel, quality problems (which, for example, resulted in very significant non-conformancecosts in the fiscal year 2019), financial difficulties of our customers and/or significant partners,cost overruns or contractual penalties caused by unexpected technological or technical problems,unforeseen developments at the project sites, unforeseen changes or difficulties in the regulatoryor political environment, performance problems relating to our suppliers, subcontractors andconsortium partners, or logistical difficulties. For example, when executing large projects, we areoften required to form a consortium with other parties and customers regularly require that weaccept joint and several liability for our consortium partners. Should such partners fail to deliveron their part of the project, we could be held liable for expenses or other costs, includingdamages. Disagreements with our customers or our consortium partners regarding allocation ofadditional project costs and responsibilities ( e.g., for delays and disruptions during a project), can
be time-consuming, expensive and may absorb significant management capacities. Our projectbusiness may also be negatively affected by various effects of COVID-19 (see “ 3.1.3 Our industries
and business operations are subject to various risks relating to global or local outbreaks ofinfectious diseases and other public health crises. In particular, we are affected from the falloutof the outbreak of the recent Coronavirus pandemic. ”).
In connection with a contract for the construction of the “Olkiluoto 3” nuclear power plant in
Finland for Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO), Siemens AG will continue to be externally liablevis-à-vis TVO and Siemens AG’s consortium partners. Due to a significant delay of the project,TVO will likely raise delay claims against the consortium or may pursue termination of thecontract, potentially triggering additional significant claims from TVO. As between Siemens AGand Siemens Energy, Siemens Energy will be responsible for the execution of the project. SiemensAG has agreed to cover certain potential claims of TVO, to the extent these claims exceed
30
€83 million. However, in certain cases Siemens Energy may have to first satisfy such claims
vis-à-vis TVO and may only be able to obtain relief from Siemens AG following legal proceedingsagainst Siemens AG’s consortium partners. As a result, Siemens Energy may not be able to obtainthe aforementioned relief in time or in full, which could have a significant financial impact onSiemens Energy. Apart from the foregoing, Siemens Energy will be entitled to all benefits andbear all risks associated with the project execution and Siemens AG’s position as a party to theconsortium agreement, including risks related to warranty, availability, delays or non-completionof the project. Any of these risks, if they materialize, may result in substantial losses.
Some of our multi-year contracts also contain demanding installation and maintenance
requirements in addition to other performance criteria relating to timing, unit cost andcompliance with government regulations, which, if not satisfied, could subject us to substantialcontractual penalties, damages, non-payment and contract interruption, suspension ortermination. There can be no assurance that contracts and projects, in particular those with long-term duration and fixed-priced calculation, can be completed profitably. Where projects fail orare delayed, we may face claims for penalties or damages from our partners or customers. Forexample, our SGRE segment was forced to adjust its profitability target in January 2020 followingunforeseen costs in a low triple-digit million euro amount relating to five onshore projects (1.1GW) in northern Europe, mainly Norway, caused by adverse road conditions and the unusualearly arrival of winter weather, which delayed project execution substantially. In the case oftransmission projects, customers may have to pay penalties or damages to power plant operatorsfor delays or interruptions of grid connections and seek to recoup such damage payment from us.In power plant projects, damages to power plant operators due to delays may also includepenalties or damages from regulators, investors or customers, with whom operators have signedpower purchase agreements.
When developing new projects, we regularly incur upfront investments that may be lost if the
project does not materialize as planned or at all. In order to successfully develop new projects,we require project development and investments specialists whose internal training is time-consuming, while experienced experts are in short supply on the labor market.
The materialization of any such project-specific risks, planning miscalculations or other
unexpected delays or disruptions could lead to significant increases in project costs, negativelyaffect the performance of projects and could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial position and results of operations.
3.2.7 Customers may be successful in negotiating or renegotiating terms and conditions in
their contracts that are disadvantageous for us, leading to lower revenues andprofitability.
Many of our customers are large companies with considerable bargaining power. These, or other
customers, may from time to time be able to negotiate terms and conditions in their contractsthat are disadvantageous for us, which could lead to lower revenues and margins. For existingcontracts, such customers may request renegotiations or may terminate their contracts. Whereverour customers’ ability to generate profits with the products and services we provide is negativelyaffected, we have in the past encountered, and may in the future encounter, pressure torenegotiate existing or future contracts. This is particularly relevant for long-term serviceprograms where our customers may consider enforcing contractual scope reductions and/orchanges in the operating profiles and commercial terms, or, alternatively, abandon or shut-downexisting plants and terminate the long-term programs entirely. Customers may also choose not torenew long-term programs ( e.g., with respect to maintenance and other services) or seek early
termination, for example, to allow a competitor to service our products at a lower price. Forexample, lower and more fluctuating demand for centrally produced energy negatively impactssome of our long-standing customers. Further circumstances which may prompt renegotiationsinclude higher prices for carbon-dioxide certificates, increasing shares of renewables, as well ascontinuously low spot market prices for electricity. Less operating hours of our installed fleetcould reduce the need for service activities, which may materially adversely impact our servicebacklog volume and profitability. Renegotiations or cancellations by our customers could
31
therefore significantly reduce the revenue and profit we are able to realize from our order
backlog.
In addition, the separation from Siemens contemplates the transfer of certain contracts to
Siemens Energy. As such transfer in most cases requires the consent of the counterparty,counterparties may use the consent requirement as leverage to enter into renegotiations.
3.2.8 We face risks relating to potential acquisitions, including difficulties regarding the
integration of the acquired business, and divestitures. Similar risks exist inconnection to entering into or exiting from joint ventures with partners.
From time to time, in order to execute our strategy, we may divest our activities in some business
areas and strengthen others through portfolio measures, including mergers and acquisitions.With the same objective, we may enter into or exit from joint ventures with partners.
With respect to divestitures, we may not be able to divest some of our activities as planned, and
the divestitures we do carry out could have a negative impact on our business situation, financialposition, results of operations and reputation. In addition, in the event of divestitures, acquirersmay successfully bring claims against us, e.g., based on alleged violations of representations and
warranties.
Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky because of difficulties that may arise when
integrating personnel, operations, technologies and products. There can be no assurance thatany of the businesses we acquire can be integrated successfully and on schedule, that they willperform as anticipated once integrated, or that any potentially anticipated synergies can actuallybe realized. Moreover, we may be unable to retain key personnel and key customers of theacquired businesses. We may also assume material unknown risks and liabilities if we fail toaccurately assess these prior to the acquisition, and there can be no assurance that we will haverecourse claims against the sellers of the acquired business. Acquisitions may be capital intensiveand tie up valuable management resources. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we willbe able to identify suitable targets or complete acquisitions on favorable terms or at all.
In addition, we may incur significant transaction costs, administrative costs, tax and other
expenditures in connection with these transactions, including costs related to integration ofacquired businesses. Furthermore, portfolio measures may result in additional financing needsand adversely affect our capital structure. Acquisitions can lead to substantial additions tointangible assets, including goodwill, in our statements of financial position. If we were toencounter continuing adverse business developments or if the acquired businesses were toperform worse than expected, then these intangible assets, including goodwill, may have to beimpaired, which could adversely affect our business situation, financial position and results ofoperations (see also “ 3.3.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of
our total assets, which could be significantly reduced if we had to recognize impairments. ”). For
example, our SGRE segment incurred significant integration costs of €109 million, €90 million
and€103 million in the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, after the merger of
Gamesa and Siemens’ wind power business that led to the formation of SGRE S.A. In the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, our SGRE segment incurred €116 million integration costs in
connection with the merger and also with the integration of selected European Senvion assetsacquired in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2020, and further integration costs are expected.
3.2.9 We may be unable to hire or retain enough qualified staff for key competence areas
and the current number of our staff may be insufficient to adequately address thechallenges we face, in particular in exceptional circumstances.
Competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel remains intense in the industries and
regions in which we operate. We have an ongoing need for highly skilled employees and a needto enhance the diversity of our workforce. Our future success depends in part on our continuedability to identify, assess, hire, integrate, develop and retain engineers, digital talents,experienced legal personnel, and other qualified personnel on all levels. Our conventional energyactivities may reduce our appeal to the personnel we seek to hire. We may lose highly qualified
32
employees and key personnel and the risk of losing key personnel and their know-how to
competitors may increase due to the Spin-Off or in case of any future reorganization plans andthe individually perceived uncertainties going along with such plans.
Some of our employees are highly specialized and are difficult to replace. We are in the process
of implementing a number of core corporate functions as a stand-alone business (see “ 3.5.2 We
may face difficulties in satisfying certain treasury and finance requirements as well as performingcertain services and functions that historically were provided by the Siemens Group. ” below) and
the current number of our staff may be insufficient to adequately address the challenges weface, in particular in exceptional circumstances.
3.2.10 We are dependent on good relationships with our workforce. Strikes or other labor-
related conflicts as well as rising wages or indirect labor costs could have a materialadverse effect on our business.
Personnel expenses represent a significant cost factor for the Group. Most of our staff at the
German locations, and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the world, is covered by collectivebargaining agreements. Although we believe that we have good relationships with ourworkforce, works councils and unions, there is no assurance that when existing collectivebargaining agreements expire, new agreements will be concluded on terms that are satisfactoryto us. It also cannot be ruled out that agreements will only be reached following strikes or similaractions. If production is affected over a longer period of time by labor disputes, this could have amaterial adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. Therelationship with our employees may also be negatively affected by the disruptive trends in theenergy industry that require changes in our strategy and may require us to adjust our portfolioand manufacturing footprint and thus to reduce our workforce. In our operations in emergingmarkets, labor costs may continue to increase as a result of wage inflation in these countries andrising unrest among low-paid people. Indirect labor costs could increase, for example due tocontinued inflation of medical costs.
3.2.11 In connection with existing and potential future reorganization and cost savings
measures, we may incur substantial restructuring expenses and cash outflows. Wemay not be able to realize expected cost savings or we may fail to adjust ourorganizational and manufacturing footprint in a timely manner or at all, and suchreorganizations may not yield the targeted benefits or may damage our reputation.
The markets in which we operate as a global supplier of technology for the energy and electricity
sectors are subject to disruptive developments which have required us to adjust ourorganizational and manufacturing footprint, including cost-out savings, to adapt to changingmarket conditions, in particular market upswings or downswings and may require us to makesuch adjustments in the future. Our business prospects could be materially adversely affected ifwe are unable to make such adjustments in time or at all. Further reorganizations andproductivity programs may be required to adapt to a changing product portfolio or customerbasis or to price pressure in the market.
The implementation of potential reorganization programs in response to downswings or such
changes may from time to time require the reduction of personnel in some functional areas orreorganization of manufacturing sites and may require us to incur significant restructuringexpenses ( e.g., severance payments) that affect our results of operations. For example, in our Gas
and Power segment, various reorganization, performance enhancement and cost savingsprograms were initiated in prior years, some of which are still ongoing, initiated in succession topreceding measures, which were substantially completed. Such programs have resulted insubstantial restructuring costs from personnel-related measures leading to severance charges inour Gas and Power segment totaling €247 million, €375 million and €43 million in the fiscal
years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and to €31 million in the nine-
month period ended June 30, 2020. In our SGRE segment, reorganization, performanceenhancement and cost savings programs were initiated, some of which are also still ongoing,resulting in restructuring costs totaling €32 million, €86 million and nil in the fiscal years ended
33
September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and to €41 million in the nine-month period
ended June 30, 2020.
Any reorganization measure may lead to significant cash outflows, including due to severance
charges. In addition, our ability to adapt our footprint or re-size our support functions quicklymay be limited due to labor law restrictions, in particular when compared to certain competitors.
Furthermore, reorganization, performance enhancement and cost savings measures may not
yield the targeted results.
The implementation of potential future measures may also result in substantial restructuring
expenses and cash outflows, which could end up being higher than planned, and theimplementation may take longer than originally expected or ultimately fail, e.g., due to
regulatory requirements varying from country to country.
In our Gas and Power segment, we evaluate the implementation of further potential
restructuring and optimization measures. For this purpose, the evaluation process is ongoingfocusing on shaping the exact scope and parameters, in particular for footprint optimization andproject execution for footprint consolidation, re-sizing of functions and integration of previousacquisitions, and further measures needed to achieve profitability targets. No resolution has beenmade yet on future measures and these measures are, inter alia , subject to consultation with
employee representatives. For the implementation of measures forming part of our existingrestructuring programs and potential further restructuring and optimization measures with thetargeted global cost savings, we believe that restructuring costs will amount cumulatively to amid to high triple digit euro million amount for fiscal years 2020 to 2023. Furthermore, at thetime the evaluation process related to the further potential restructuring and optimizationmeasures crystalizes further, potentially in the near future already, this may lead to significantlyhigher expenses and also to further restructuring measures associated with further expenses. Theincrease of expenses associated with restructuring and optimization measures may not necessarilycorrespond with additional savings in all instances.
In our SGRE segment, we also evaluate the implementation of further potential restructuring and
optimization programs. Within its new “LEAP” program, our SGRE segment plans to maintain itsfocus on productivity, asset management and operational excellence. As part of that, our SGREsegment will be constantly analyzing footprint optimization measures and also fixed costs,including selling and general administrative expenses, among others, need to be optimized toreach target profitability levels. For example, our SGRE segment has recently announced arestructuring plan in India which will have an impact in the fiscal year 2021. In addition, our SGREsegment is still investing in integration activities out of the merger that led to the formation ofSGRE S.A. in fields such as IT or in integration of acquired European Senvion assets, amongothers. In our SGRE segment, we expect to incur integration and restructuring costs in the fiscalyears 2021 to 2023 of up to a mid triple digit million euro amount, the majority of these costs areexpected to be attributable to potential restructuring measures currently under evaluation. Theintegration measures may mainly relate to IT projects, and may also include potential measures inconnection with the integration of European Senvion assets, while the potential restructuringmeasures may primarily relate to turnaround efforts regarding the onshore business. Bothintegration and restructuring costs are expected to be substantially incurred by the end of thefiscal year 2022.
Failure to implement potential reorganization measures, including productivity programs, in
response to downswings could result in overcapacities, while failure to implement such measuresin response to upswings may result in loss of businesses. We may also lose key personnel if weprove unable to adapt to changing market conditions. Strikes and disputes with unions andworks councils may result in negative media coverage and delivery problems. Additionally, publiccriticism related to a reorganization might negatively impact our reputation. Even if we succeedto implement potential reorganization measures as we see fit, there can be no assurance thatthey will yield the targeted cost savings.
34
In addition, in certain countries, a part of our investment requirements for developing and
expanding our capacity and our product portfolio, in particular with respect to innovativeconcepts, is sometimes covered by public aid, such as subsidies, loans at favorable conditions ortax reductions or exemptions. If we were to close certain manufacturing plants or business lines,we may have to repay in full or in part public aid received in the past, which can be substantial.
If we are unable to successfully implement planned potential reorganization, performance
enhancement or cost savings measures or if these do not result in the planned savings, this couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
3.2.12 We hold certain minority stakes in different companies in which we have only limited
influence, and whose mandatory periodic valuation may require us to recognizeimpairments.
We hold certain minority stakes in companies, including in the context of joint ventures or other
cooperations and partnerships. Examples include our participations in RWG (Repair&Overhauls)Limited, UK, Maschinenfabrik Reinhausen GmbH, Germany, Voith Hydro Holding GmbH & Co.KG, Germany, and EthosEnergy Group Limited, UK. In such cases, we have only limited influenceon the organization and business success of the entities concerned. Thus, our ability to exploitthe strategic potential of such joint ventures, cooperations, partnerships and investments may beimpaired if we were unable to agree with our partners and co-shareholders on a commonstrategy and its implementation. Our interests may also conflict with the interests of othershareholders in such entities, and we may be prevented from achieving our own goals, forexample due to the governance structure and rights allocation within the entity and theapplicable partnership agreements. Any such conflicts may also give rise to claims, which can becostly and time consuming and have a negative effect on the future performance of the jointventure or entity. In case the entity underperforms, we may have to contribute additional,unexpected funds to enable the continued operations of the entity or to service financial orother debts of the entity, while we may still not be able to significantly influence themanagement and operations of the participation due to our minority stake.
Our at-equity investments must be revalued as at the respective reporting dates. Any factors
negatively influencing the financial position and results of operations of our at-equityinvestments and other investments could negatively affect the earnings contributions of suchinvestments or may result in impairments. For example, in the fiscal year ended September 30,2018, Siemens Energy recognized an impairment loss of €154 million related to an at-equity
investment presented in our Gas and Power segment. With a view to our at-equity investment inSiemens Ltd., India (“ Siemens India ”), which is a listed company, an obligation to write-down the
value of this investment may be triggered by a decline in its publicly quoted share price that maybe lower than the carrying amount of the investment (see “ 3.5.10 In certain countries, carve-outs
may be deferred or even fail or Siemens will retain parts of the Siemens Gas and Power business.In these countries, limited access to the local markets, established facilities, research anddevelopment resources may have an adverse impact on our business prospects and operations. Inaddition, contractual agreements may require us to purchase the local business after terminationof the contract, which may result in significant cash outflows. ”). In addition, our business
situation, financial position and results of operations could also be adversely affected inconnection with loans, guarantees or non-compliance with financial covenants related to theseinvestments.
If the Group is unable to successfully engage with fellow joint ventures and partners it may not
be able to fully realize the strategic potential of such joint ventures and partnerships and thismay have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
3.2.13 Local content and local standard requirements may negatively impact our business
and place additional strains on our operations. Non-compliance may result in claimsfor penalties, damages or in termination of contracts.
Some countries, e.g., Australia, Brazil, China, India, Saudi Arabia or Russia, prescribe minimum
local content requirements by statute. Such legislation may, among other things, require us to
35
purchase from local suppliers, recruit local staff, including executive staff, set up local
manufacturing facilities, or otherwise make direct investments in the relevant market.Furthermore, a large portion of the world’s oil and gas reserves are controlled by state-owned oilcompanies. State-owned oil companies may require us to meet local content requirements orother local standards, such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with localpartners, which could be difficult or undesirable for us. Similar obligations may be imposed on usby state-owned or state-affiliated energy companies outside of the oil sector. Further, we couldalso be forced to transfer business or technology into local majority holdings in order to accesscertain markets. A failure to meet local content requirements and other local standards mayadversely impact our operations in such countries. This may result in inefficiencies, higher risksresulting from increased complexities, lack of transparency, claims for penalties or damages or intermination of contracts or reduced profitability. If we have to work with local suppliers or othercontractors, we may have difficulties ensuring proper production quality, e.g., due to limited
choice of contractors, a preferred vendor list or contractual stipulations. Any unforeseen changeor reinforcements of local content or local standard requirements may result in additional costsor investment requirements in order to comply with such regulations.
If additional local content and local standard regulations are implemented, or if existing
regulations are enhanced, or if we fail to comply with the regulations, which could increase theGroup’s costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results ofoperations.
3.3 Financial Risks
3.3.1 We may have to write down inventories or other assets, which could adversely affect
our financial position and result in loss of profitability.
We may have built up, or in the future may build up, inventories (both “work-in-progress” and
finished goods) that cannot be sold or only sold at lower-than-calculated prices, either becausethere is insufficient demand from the market ( e.g., due to an overall economic recession or
technological obsolescence) or intense competition. This may require us to write down thecarrying value of such inventory, negatively impacting our profit and financial position. Forexample, in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2020, our Gas and Power segment had torecognize inventory write-downs of €225 million, related to a strategic portfolio decision on
certain small gas turbine platforms due to a change in addressing segments of the industrialapplication market. Our SGRE segment recognized a write-down of inventories in an amount of€102 million in this nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, as a result of the deterioration of
the Indian market and the corresponding restructuring plan.
The risk of write-downs is particularly present in the case of goods with longer lead times and
where we are unable to quickly adapt our supply chain ( e.g., deliveries received for parts and
components) to the current load situation. This risk is further exacerbated by the decreasingmarket demand for gas turbines which has led to an increase in the inventory of gas turbines.Impairment charges may also have to be recognized in respect of developed products andassociated production lines, plants, real estate, production tooling and other assets. Furthermore,we have in the past manufactured products in anticipation of orders which failed to materialize.In some of these instances, we were required to write down the resulting inventory and therecan be no guarantee that we will be able to avoid such cases in the future.
3.3.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total
assets, which could be significantly reduced if we had to recognize impairments.
Goodwill, as presented in our Combined Financial Statements, comprises the goodwill
attributable to the SGRE segment, as well as goodwill attributable to the Gas and Powersegment. As of June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, the carrying value of goodwill amountedto€9,593 million and €9,815 million, or 21.1% and 21.8% of our total assets as presented in
our Combined Statements of Financial Position, primarily related to the acquisition of DresserRand and the merger that led to the formation of SGRE S.A. Other intangible assets also
36
represent a significant share of total assets. As of June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, the
carrying value of other intangible assets amounted to €4,016 million and €4,743 million, or
8.8% and 10.5% of our total assets as presented in our Combined Statements of FinancialPosition. An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount which is the higher of: the fair value less cost ofdisposal; and the value in use. Impairment losses may result from, among other things,deterioration in performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws orregulations and a variety of other factors. For example, in the third quarter of the fiscal year2020, we recognized impairments of intangible assets related to small gas turbine platforms dueto a change in addressing segments of the industrial application market in the Gas and Powersegment in an amount of €476 million. In our SGRE segment, we recognized an impairment of
intangible assets in an amount of €82 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, as
a result of the deterioration of the Indian market and the corresponding restructuring plan. Anyof the aforementioned factors may cause an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assetsif they have a lasting negative impact on our business. The amount of any quantified impairmentmust be expensed immediately as a charge to our results of operations. Therefore, depending onfuture circumstances, it cannot be ruled out that we may not realize the full value of ourgoodwill or other intangible assets. Any determination of impairment of goodwill or otherintangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, resultsof operations, and, in addition, may significantly deteriorate the confidence of importantstakeholders.
3.3.3 We are exposed to credit risks and may need to write off or write down receivables if
our contractual partners are unable to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in financial instruments if the contractual partner fails
to discharge its obligations in full and on time or if the value of collateral declines. We may incurlosses if the credit quality of our contractual partners deteriorates or if they default on, or fallbehind schedule with, their payment obligations to us. We are in particular exposed to creditrisks relating to trade receivables arising from our ordinary course of business, i.e., trade
receivables from the sale of goods and services. This may also be the case if we are unable to selltrade receivables due to a changing macroeconomic environment. A decision to write down orwrite off claims against contractual partners involves management judgment and review ofindividual receivables based on individual customer creditworthiness, current economic trendsand analysis of historical bad debts on a portfolio basis. The write-off or write-down of ourreceivables may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results ofoperations.
3.3.4 Our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers require access to
significant credit and guarantee lines and other financing instruments. Our businessactivities could be negatively affected if we are unable to meet our capitalrequirements in the future, for example in weak financial market environments, as aresult of a significant deterioration of our credit standing or of a breach of a creditfacility agreement, or if access to capital becomes more expensive. Our businessactivities could be similarly negatively affected if our customers or suppliers do nothave access to financing on economically viable terms.
Since the energy industry is subject to considerable technological change, our future capital
requirements for the development and industrialization of new products, future acquisitions,investments and necessary reorganization measures may be significant. Reflective of oursubstantial project business, our working capital levels have in the past, and are expected to be inthe future, volatile.
Our ability to obtain debt financing, guarantees or derivative or hedging lines from financial
institutions at commercially acceptable terms, including volume and costs, could depend onseveral factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, theavailability of credit from financial institutions, market interest rates and global and EU
37
monetary policy and financial markets regulation. In addition, deterioration in our business
results, financial position or credit ratings of Siemens Energy AG and/or SGRE S.A. could lead tohigher financing and hedging costs, to reduced availability of credit, hedging and guaranteelines, reduced access to capital markets, other commercially unfavorable terms or an accelerationof loans or provision of security.
Furthermore, our SGRE segment and the other Siemens Energy Group companies will be treated
as a so-called “single borrower unit” ( Kreditnehmereinheit ) under the large exposure regulation
for banks under the German Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz ). Any indebtedness taken on by our
SGRE segment may, therefore, limit the ability of Siemens Energy as a whole to borrow funds,having access to hedging lines and obtaining guarantees and vice versa. Absent sufficient futurecash flows and available financing and other credit lines, such as guarantees and derivative lines,we may not be able to adequately finance our normal business activities and to realize newinvestments or acquisitions or continue our daily operations, which could in turn have a materialadverse effect on our growth prospects, our competitive position and our business, financialposition and results of operations.
We concluded a syndicated facility agreement with a multi-currency revolving credit facility of
€3 billion in July 2020. SGRE S.A. concluded, among other things, a syndicated multi-currency
revolving facility and loan agreement with a term loan tranche of €0.5 billion and a revolving
credit line tranche of €2.0 billion in May 2018, which was amended and extended in December
2019. The revolving credit facilities are for general business purposes. During the term of thefacility agreements, we must comply with the obligations, covenants and restrictions set outtherein. In the event of a breach of certain contractual obligations, or the non-fulfillment of arepayment obligation, or, via a cross-acceleration provision relating to other financialindebtedness incurred by us, exceeding a certain threshold amount, there is a risk that thelenders terminate the facility agreement for cause. In the event of such termination, theoutstanding amounts would be immediately due for repayment, which could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Similar risks mayapply depending on the individually agreed terms of local credit facility agreements. In the eventof a breach of certain contractual obligations or the non-fulfillment of payment obligationsunder credit facility agreements, these agreements may be terminated and the financialinstitutions will not grant further credit, including guarantees. Derivative, hedging lines andother financial instruments may contain cross-default clauses that allow termination. Upontermination of certain of these agreements, market value compensation may have to be paid.
Our business activities could be similarly negatively affected if our customers or suppliers do not
have access to financing on economically viable terms or if they or their lenders rate our ability toexecute capital intensive turnkey projects worse due to a deterioration of our financial position,results of operation or credit ratings. This risk may be further exacerbated as the businessactivities of Siemens Energy focus exclusively on energy market segments. Prior to our separationfrom Siemens, we benefitted from the strong credit ratings of Siemens AG, e.g., as the principal
of parent company guarantees. In the future, such support by Siemens will no longer be availableto us for new projects. Siemens Energy AG and SGRE S.A. have received investment grade ratings.However, the ratings of Siemens Energy AG and SGRE S.A. are lower than the rating of SiemensAG, and it remains to be seen to what extent such lower credit ratings will be a competitivedisadvantage. This risk could be further exacerbated if Siemens Energy AG’s or SGRE S.A.’screditworthiness were to deteriorate. Without investment grade rating, we could face significantchallenges in winning new contracts, substantially increasing financing and hedging costs andrefinancing risks as well as substantially decreasing availability of credit lines, e.g., for financing,
guarantee and hedging purposes.
Further, development of and bidding for large projects, in particular of the Gas and Power
segment’s Generation division and of the SGRE segment, may require arrangement ofco-financings of respective projects, e.g., by means of providing development loans, structured
debt financings and/or equity investments. We face the risk that we may not be able to providesuch financings either directly or indirectly via the involvement of third parties which maynegatively impact our ability to successfully bid for such projects. While we have concluded a
38
preferred financing agreement with Siemens under which Siemens, as first priority partner, is
willing to offer, under certain conditions, debt and commercial financing as well as, up to adefined maximum amount, equity financing for Gas and Power customers and their projects(including power plant projects) at arm’s length through its financial services operations, thisagreement may be terminated by either party. Termination may be affected for, among otherreasons, if (i) Siemens’ directly or indirectly holds less than 25% of the shares and/or voting rightsin the Company (excluding shares directly or indirectly held by Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. or anyother entity holding or managing plan assets under or in connection with Siemens Group’sbenefit plans) or (ii) another shareholder, either individually or acting in concert with others,holds 25% or more of the shares and/or voting rights in the Company or exercises control overthe Company, in both cases, (i) and (ii), with a phase-out period of 36 months from the receipt ofan effective termination notice. In the case of a termination pursuant to item (i), however, thereceipt of a termination notice during the first three years of the term of the preferred financingagreement results in the 36-month phase notice period commencing on the third anniversary ofthe Spin-Off Completion. SGRE also concluded a preferred financing agreement with nearlycomparable terms with Siemens. If (i) the preferred financing agreements are terminated, (ii) notproperly implemented by the parties or (iii) there is need for financing support beyond the scopecontemplated in the preferred financing agreements, we may not be able to set up our owncapabilities in the required scope to provide financing for customers or may only be able toprocure external financing from other sources at potentially increased costs when compared withthe conditions of the preferred financing agreements. Insofar as projects depend on adequatefinancing capabilities, we may lose revenue or only achieve lower profits.
Siemens Energy makes use of different national ECAs, which support and promote national
exports by providing risk coverage for lenders and exporters. In order to benefit from ECAs’support, we have to comply with their terms and conditions. Failure to comply with the termsand conditions of the ECA’s cover decision may result in the loss of the respective project-specificECA cover and in combination with an indemnification event this could result in reclaims fromthe ECA or lenders. If these ECAs change their terms and conditions and regulations or therespective national government or entities with regulatory power change the basis for the modeof operation of the respective ECAs, this may impact Siemens Energy and our customers’ andlenders’ ability to benefit from ECA support and could thus negatively impact the demand forour offerings.
With respect to ESG, increasingly strict financial institutions’ internal, industry-wide or policy-
driven prerequisites for all dimensions of ESG may negatively impact Siemens Energy’scapabilities to procure funding, securities, hedging instruments, insurance or other financialservices from banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. In particular, withregard to sustainable financing, the EIB announced in November 2019 that it will end financingfor fossil fuel energy projects from the end of 2021, and that its future financing will focus onaccelerating clean energy innovation, energy efficiency and renewable energy. In addition, theEIB stated that it would align all financing activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement fromthe end of 2020. Furthermore, the EU’s taxonomy for sustainable activities includes an actionplan for financing of sustainable growth, which is aimed at facilitating certain sustainableinvestments. If, based on such sustainability policies or other policies related to differentdimensions of ESG, banks were to refuse to provide financing to, or issue guarantees for, SiemensEnergy or ECAs providing support and respective risk coverage, this could have a negative impacton the availability of attractive financing for Siemens Energy’s business. Such policies may alsolimit our customers’ ability to obtain attractive financing, which may result in a lower demandfor our offering. Similarly, internal ESG guidelines may prevent certain investors from providingequity financing to us.
Furthermore, financial institutions increasingly demand representations in financing contracts
with regard to compliance with sanctions or other export control measures. Failure to complywith sanctions and other control regimes may adversely impact our financing ability. We believethese risks are particularly relevant with a view to our oil & gas and conventional generationactivities and will make the financing for such projects more difficult.
39
3.3.5 We are exposed to currency fluctuation risks in various countries that could
materially adversely affect our profitability and cause fluctuations in cash flow andreported earnings as well as our equity.
Due to the global scale of our business and the high level of regionalization of many of our
businesses, our results of operations are affected to a significant extent by foreign exchange ratemovements. There are transactional risks which arise when we and our subsidiaries executetransactions in a currency other than our or our subsidiary’s respective functional currency. Thelargest project execution, engineering, production and research and development hubs of ourbusiness are in Germany, the U.S., the UK, Spain, Denmark and China while our sales are global.This means that while income is generated in various currencies, costs are predominatelydenominated in euro, U.S. dollar, British Pound, Danish Krone and Renminbi.
Foreign currency exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in
the respective currencies as well as production and other contributions along the value chain inlocal markets. We seek to manage the transaction exposure resulting from contractualcommitments as well as planned transactions in foreign currencies in a way that at least 75% butno more than 100% of the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged. If applicable, for suchhedging transactions hedge accounting is used to reduce earnings volatility. However, changes incurrency exchange rates generally cannot be predicted and cannot always be hedged oneconomically reasonable terms, and there can be no assurance that our hedging and other riskmitigation strategies will always be successful in mitigating currency risks. If we are unable tomatch sales revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, ourresults of operations may be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. In case ofunfavorable exchange rate fluctuations, we may be able to offer our products only atcomparatively higher prices or lower profit margins. This currency-related competitivedisadvantage can lead to a decline in revenue or a lower profit margin for Siemens Energy. Firmbids and offers in a currency other than the respective functional currency of the concernedSiemens Energy Company may create a currency risk, which are generally not hedged. There isalso the risk that currency conversion restrictions or cross-border money transfer prohibitions,either by administrative orders or due to banks’ policies, occur that may prevent us fromconverting or transferring funds for a certain period of time or at all. Discrepancies between thematurity and cash flow profiles of hedging instruments and underlying transactions may result involatility of cash flows, e.g., from cash settlements with banks when hedges expire prior to the
underlying transaction due to local hedge limitations, e.g., in case of non deliverable forwards in
Brazil. This and any negative effects from currency exchange rate exposure could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
We are also exposed to foreign exchange translation risks through the translation of our foreign
subsidiaries financial statements into the euro for the preparation of our consolidated financialstatements. Due to the foregoing, changes in exchange rates between our local currencies andthe euro could lead to significant changes in our financial position from period to period.
3.3.6 We have assumed significant pension liabilities, and we are unwinding and
establishing employee participation programs, the actual costs incurred in connectionwith the resulting liabilities may substantially exceed our current estimates.
Pension benefits are granted to a large portion of the employees of Siemens Energy. These
obligations have been grouped in different pension plans depending on the legal, economic andtax environment of the relevant countries. For a major part, the pension schemes are designed asdefined benefit plans, either funded in the form of external plan assets (so-called “pension planassets”) or unfunded. The provisions for pensions and similar obligations may be affected bychanges in actuarial assumptions, including the life expectancy, the discount rate, as well as bymovements in financial markets.
Actual developments may differ from assumptions, e.g., due to changing market and economic
conditions, thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the actual obligations. Significantfluctuations in the financial markets or a change in the portfolio mix of plan assets can result insignificant increases or decreases in the attributable fair value of plan assets over time. This
40
applies particularly to equity securities. Also, changes in the valuation assumptions of pension
obligations can affect the defined benefit obligation. For example, a change in discount rates, inparticular, may result in changes in the defined benefit obligation. A one-half percentage pointincrease in the assumed discount rates would have led to a decrease in the defined benefitobligations of €209 million for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. A reduction of one
half percentage point of the assumed discount rates would have led to an increase of the definedbenefit obligation of €246 million for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.
As of June 30, 2020, we had defined benefit obligations of €3,380 million. The fair value of plan
assets amounted to €2,315 million. Including the increasing effect of asset ceiling of €1 million,
this led to a net defined benefit balance of €1,067 million as of June 30, 2020. As of June 30,
2020, provisions for pensions and similar obligations in our Combined Statements of FinancialPosition amounted to €1,095 million. Plans with net assets were recognized in other assets with
an amount of €29 million as of June 30, 2020. A significant increase in the underfunding may
have a negative effect on our capital structure and rating, and thus may tighten refinancingoptions and increase costs.
We may face the risk of increasing cash outflows if local pension regulations require higher
funding levels or change otherwise.
Furthermore, the legal conditions governing our pension obligations are subject to changes in
applicable legislation or case law. We may incur new or more extensive pension obligations inthe future due to changes in such legislation and case law, or changes may negatively impactprevious calculations with respect to our pension obligations. Moreover, future amendments toaccounting standards may affect our pension obligations.
Finally, many of our employees participate in employee participation programs established and
maintained by Siemens. In connection with the Spin-Off, we will be unwinding these programsfor our employees by, among other things, making cash payments to relevant employees. Thepayout amount is generally based on the publicly quoted price of the shares in Siemens on thetransaction date. The higher the quoted share price the higher the amount that must be paid outto relevant employees. Accordingly, if the share price levels exceed current assumptions, actualcosts could be significantly higher than currently expected. Furthermore, we will be establishingemployee participation programs similar to those in which our employees participated when wewere a part of Siemens Group. The costs for these programs may significantly exceed currentexpectations.
3.3.7 Our profit forecasts as well as our other profitability and revenue targets could differ
materially from our actual results of operations.
We currently expect: our Group’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to
range from (1)% to 1% and 3% to 5%, respectively,
 our Segment’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items for the Gas and Power Segment in
the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to range from 0% to 2% and 3.5% to 5.5%, respectively, and
 our Segment’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items for the SGRE Segment in the fiscal
years 2020 and 2021 to range from (3)% to (1)% and 3% to 5%, respectively.
For the purpose of these forecasts, we assumed: our Group’s Revenue Growth Rate in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to range from (5)% to (2)%
and 2% to 12%, respectively,
 our Segment’s Revenue Growth Rate for the Gas and Power Segment in the fiscal years 2020
and 2021 to range from (5)% to (3)% and 2% to 11%, respectively, and
 our Segment’s Revenue Growth Rate for the SGRE Segment in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to
range from (7)% to (2)% and 3% to 12%, respectively.
41
For the fiscal year 2023, we target our Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in a range
from 6.5% to 8.5%. For the fiscal year 2023, we target Adjusted EBITA Margin before SpecialItems for our Gas and Power segment in a range from 6% to 8% and for our SGRE segment in arange from 8% to 10%. In the mid-term, we target an Adjusted EBITA Margin of at least 8% andour revenue to grow over a rolling three year average in a range from 0% to 3% (excludingportfolio and currency effects).
The Company’s executive board (the “ Executive Board ”) has based the profit forecast as well as
the other profitability and revenue targets on a number of assumptions, which are inherentlysubject to significant business, operational, economic and other risks and many of which areoutside of our control. Accordingly, such assumptions may change or may not materialize at all.Should one or more of the assumptions underlying the profit forecast as well as the otherprofitability and revenue targets prove to be incorrect, our actual results of operations for therespective future period(s) could differ materially. As a result, investors should not place unduereliance on them.
3.4 Compliance, Regulatory, Legal and Tax Risks
3.4.1 We are subject to risks from disputes and administrative, legal and arbitration
proceedings which could result in penalties, damages and loss of reputation.
Siemens Energy is, and potentially will be in the future, involved in several administrative, legal
and arbitration proceedings in various jurisdictions. Frequently encountered situations includeclaims from or against project partners and customers regarding delays and disruptions,non-performance as well as labor disputes, antitrust issues, product liability, warranty claims andIP rights. The significance and outcome of these proceedings can vary greatly, and many of thesecases could have considerable negative consequences for us. These proceedings could result inSiemens Energy being subject to, e.g., payment of contractual penalties or damages (including
punitive damages), equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit. In individualcases, legal disputes may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocationor refusal to renew or grant business licenses or permits. Some of these legal disputes andproceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens Energy or decisions, assessments orrequirements of regulatory authorities could deviate from our expectations, which may havematerial effects on our business activities as well as our financial position, results of operationsand cash flows. High-profile proceedings can also divert management attention, result insignificant litigation and arbitration costs as well as negative publicity, and harm our reputation.In some cases, our reputation may suffer regardless of the merits of the claim and the outcomeof the proceedings. Moreover, Siemens Energy may incur losses relating to legal proceedingsbeyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of its insurance or exceeding any provisions made forlosses related to legal proceedings.
As of the date of this Prospectus, Siemens Energy Group companies are party in the following
material litigations:
 SGRE is currently involved in a customer claim regarding a commercial dispute relating to
execution delays in a project. Towards the end of 2019, the customer alleged that SGRE hasdelayed the project and is claiming liquidated damages for the delays up to the contractualcapped amount. In early 2020, SGRE successfully objected to (and was thus granted a courtinjunction against) the drawdown of bank guarantees by the customer. With respect to therelevant customer contract, SGRE rejects the claim. Currently, SGRE intends, and continues tomake reasonable efforts, to reach an amicable solution with the customer during the course of2020. However, it cannot be ruled out that the case will lead to litigation.
42
 In addition, SGRE is party to a number of license agreements, which afford SGRE IP rights (in
particular, patents, trademarks and design rights). In a few individual cases, there have beendisputes or disagreements resulting from the interpretation regarding the execution of theexisting agreements or from the interpretation of the scope of use rights granted by thirdparties (including competitors) to SGRE regarding their respective IP rights, or with respect toalleged IP infringements. While some of those disputes in the past years have been finallysolved by court in favor of SGRE, others are still awaiting a final resolution, or have notreached a court stage and still remain to be solved between the respective parties. On July 31,2020, General Electric Company (“ GE”) filed intellectual property related lawsuits against SGRE
entities with the District Court ( Landgericht ) in Düsseldorf, Germany, and before the U.S.
International Trade Commission (“ ITC”) asserting a violation of two patents with regard to
certain variable speed wind turbine generators and components. The German lawsuit seeks aninjunction against SGRE, mainly in relation to the manufacturing, offering and marketing ofthe relevant wind turbine generators and components in Germany, and financial compensationfor any (alleged) infringing action performed after July 15, 2020. The U.S. ITC complaint seeksan exclusion order against SGRE’s importation of certain wind turbine equipment into theUnited States. Should the complainant be successful, the financial burden to SGRE could besignificant. There is the risk that SGRE will not be able to complete projects or to win newprojects for which the affected wind turbine generators or components are required inGermany and/or the United States, or will only be able to do so at a higher cost ( e.g., if it had
to resort to alternative generators or components). Furthermore, if GE’s patents were found tobe valid and infringed upon by SGRE, SGRE could be forced to obtain a license from GE. SGREwill be defending against GE’s claims. In addition, SGRE has launched an opposition appealbefore the European Patent Office in Munich, Germany, against the European patent which isthe basis of the German lawsuit; a resolution on the appeal is still pending. It cannot beexcluded that SGRE will be involved in further disputes of such kind in individual cases in thefuture.
With regard to certain legal disputes and proceedings related to our business in which Siemens
Group is or will become a party, Siemens Energy bears the economic consequences although weare not or will not become a party due to legal requirements in disputes or due to the fact thatunderlying contractual arrangements have not been transferred to us. Pending proceedings ofSiemens Group under which we bear the economic consequences include the following materiallitigations:
 In December 2016, the BorWin Offshore Consortium (“ BorWin ”) established between Siemens
AG and another company filed a lawsuit against TenneT Offshore 1. BeteiligungsgesellschaftmbH with the district court of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, asserting contractual claimsof now approximately €88 million. The lawsuit relates to the connection of the offshore wind
power plants in the cluster ‘Borwin’ to the grid. TenneT Offshore 1. BeteiligungsgesellschaftmbH set off with counterclaims in the amount of approximately €66 million. In January 2020,
TenneT Offshore 1. Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH filed further counterclaims against BorWinasserting, among others, the correction of defects with an alleged value of approximately€61 million. BorWin disputes the set-off and is defending itself against all counterclaims.
 In December 2016, the Helwin Offshore Consortium (“ Helwin ”) established between Siemens
AG and another company filed a lawsuit against TenneT Offshore GmbH with the district courtof Frankfurt am Main, Germany, asserting contractual claims of now approximately€91 million. The lawsuit relates to the connection of the offshore wind power plants in the
cluster ‘HelWin’ to the grid. TenneT Offshore GmbH set off with counterclaims in the amountof approximately €55 million. In January 2020, TenneT Offshore GmbH filed further
counterclaims against Helwin asserting, among others, the correction of defects with analleged value of approximately €78 million. Helwin disputes the set-off and is defending itself
against all counterclaims.
43
 In December 2016, the Sylwin Offshore Consortium (“ Sylwin ”) established between Siemens
AG and another company filed a lawsuit against TenneT Offshore 7. BeteiligungsgesellschaftmbH with the district court of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, asserting contractual claimsof approximately €90 million. The lawsuit relates to the connection of the offshore wind
power plants in the cluster Sylwin to the grid. TenneT Offshore 7. Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbHset off with counterclaims in the amount of approximately €72 million. In April 2020, TenneT
Offshore 7. Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH filed further counterclaims against the Consortiumasserting, among others, the correction of defects with an alleged value of approximately€75 million. Sylwin disputes the set-off and is defending itself against all counterclaims.
Conversely, we are, and may in the future become, a party to legal proceedings that relate to
business operations that will remain with Siemens after our separation from Siemens. In somecountries, the separation of Siemens Energy from Siemens Group was executed by way of areverse carve-out, i.e., the businesses within an existing regional company that shall remain with
Siemens Group were transferred out of such regional company into a newly established SiemensGroup legal entity, while the existing regional company became part of the Siemens EnergyGroup. As a result, legal proceedings against such regional company arising in connection withbusiness activities that were previously conducted by such regional company and that do notpertain to the Siemens Energy business will remain with such regional company. Siemens EnergyGroup and Siemens Group have concluded agreements to allocate the resulting financial risks inaccordance with the separation of the business activities. However, it cannot be excluded at thisstage that, as a result of those legal proceedings, such regional company might also be(temporarily or permanently) barred from conducting certain or any business in the respectiveregion, or even be dissolved. Such an outcome could also damage our reputation. We may not beable to fully recover any losses resulting from such legal proceedings under the risk allocationagreements with Siemens. This also applies to legal proceedings in Brazil among others resultingout of Siemens’ businesses transferred into newly established Siemens Group legal entities (suchas Siemens Infraestrutura e Indústria Ltda., Siemens Mobility Ltda., Siemens HealthcareDiagnósticos S.A.). These legal proceedings remain with Siemens Energy’s subsidiary SiemensLtda. in Brazil.
3.4.2 Our operations are subject to trade and economic sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-
corruption, anti-money laundering and antitrust laws and regulations and the risk offraud.
We must comply with trade and economic sanctions, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and
regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In particular, our international operationsexpose us to potential liability under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977(“FCPA ”), the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and any applicable law, rule or regulation promulgated to
implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention onCombating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, signedDecember 17, 1997, and other similar laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption. The FCPAand the UK Bribery Act 2010 prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and businesspartners acting on our behalf, including agents, from corruptly offering, promising, authorizingor providing anything of value to a “foreign official” for the purposes of influencing officialdecisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The UKBribery Act also prohibits “commercial” bribery not involving government officials, and acceptingbribes as well as facilitation payments. We are also subject to anti-money laundering laws andregulations, including the EU’s 5
thAnti-Money Laundering Directive, and antitrust laws and
regulations prohibiting collusive and other anti-competitive practices.
Our business involves close and continuous contact with representatives of national governments
and other officials, and in particular officials who are in a position of awarding governmentcontracts and who therefore come within the scope of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.Some of the countries in which we operate lack a legal system that is as developed as those of
44
other countries, and may be perceived to have higher levels of bribery or corruption, including
illegal procurement practices. As we use subcontractors in many of our projects in such countries,we face the risk that such contractors may engage in fraudulent activity, corruption or bribery, ormay circumvent or override our internal controls (see also “ 3.4.4. Our risk management and
internal controls may not prevent or detect compliance risks, which could result in investigationsby authorities, fines, damage claims, payment claims, the termination of relationships withcustomers or suppliers and even governmental exclusion from businesses (blacklisting) as well asreputational damage. Further, our internal controls could fail to detect business risks in time orat all.” ).
Our business also must be conducted in compliance with applicable economic and trade sanctions
laws and regulations, such as those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department ofTreasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department ofCommerce, the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy, the United Nations SecurityCouncil and other relevant sanctions authorities. Our global operations expose us to the risk ofviolating, or being accused of violating, economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations. Inaddition, rapidly changing export control rules and regulations regarding business activities incritical countries, especially export control rules and regulations existing in the United States,which have extraterritorial reach, may lead to a risk of inadvertently violating specific countries’export control regulations and laws. Our failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws andregulations may expose us to reputational harm as well as significant penalties, includingcriminal fines, imprisonment, civil fines, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and debarment fromgovernment contracts, as well as other remedial measures. For example, the investigations into apossible violation of export control laws in connection with gas turbines manufactured by us and,contrary to contractual agreements, delivered to and installed in Crimea by a third party, resultedin negative publicity. Additionally, the Hamburg public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedingsagainst Siemens’ employees in regard of alleged violations of the German Foreign Trade andPayments Act ( Außenwirtschaftsgesetz ). Although internal investigations have not revealed
misconduct by Siemens employees, these public investigations are still ongoing and any potentialoutcomes may negatively affect our reputation.
Past examples of sanctions imposed by the U.S. adversely impacting our business include the
interference with our business activities in Iran following the imposition of U.S. sanctions againstthe country in 2018. Even if we do not terminate our business operations entirely, we may beincentivized to suspend the execution of projects involving countries or persons subject to suchsanctions. Moreover, the U.S. has granted waivers to Iraq for purchasing electricity and gas fromIran. If the U.S. administration decides to not renew these waivers or imposes some form ofsanctions or other restrictive measures concerning Iraq, such actions could have negativeimplications for our business in Iraq (see “ 3.1.6 Political instability, international conflicts or new
trade barriers may have a negative effect on our business, financial position and results ofoperations. ”).
In addition, such sanctions may impact us indirectly. For example, if our third-party service
providers cease to render services to us in order to comply with sanctions applicable to them,banks may refuse to facilitate financial transactions or provide guarantees. Additionally, banksmay not provide financing to our customers if they are sanctioned or may become sanctioned inthe future. Sanctions-related risks are further exacerbated by the fact that compliance withsanctions of one country may constitute a violation of the anti-sanction legislation of another,potentially leading to civil or even criminal liability of us or our representatives. For example, theEuropean Commission has adopted anti-boycott rules forbidding companies from the EU tocomply with the 2018 U.S. sanctions targeting Iran.
If we or any party related to us is found to have acted in contravention of trade and economic
sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering or antitrust laws or to haveengaged in fraudulent behavior, it would have a material adverse effect on our reputation,competitive position and, ultimately, our results of operations.
45
3.4.3 The markets in which we and our customers operate are subject to several regulatory
requirements which are subject to change.
As a group with a global business, we are exposed to various product- and country-related
regulations, laws and policies influencing our business activities and processes. Since we provideproducts and services to customers that are active in regulated energy markets, we are indirectlyaffected by the regulatory environment applicable to our customers. Changes in regulatoryenvironments for us and our customers could adversely affect us and our customers, including byreducing demand for our products, increasing costs and reducing profit.
The regulatory environment relevant to our Generation and Industrial Applications divisions is
currently significantly changing, in particular due to increased government intervention to limitclimate change by shifting energy production towards the use of more sustainable sources,primarily renewables, and reducing emissions. On a country-by-country basis, the pace of thischange varies, making our, and our customers’, regulatory environment more complex andincreasing uncertainty about the extent of future regulations and policies. Such changes couldlead to certain of our or our customers’ products, solutions and services becoming, subject togradual phase-outs, unlawful if we fail to adapt to such changes, or becoming uneconomical. Forexample, in January 2020, Germany decided to accelerate the phase-out of coal as a source forprimary energy generation. This decision may impact our service business for steam power plantsor may increase public pressure to also adapt related businesses. Further countries in Europe andaround the world have decided to exit coal power generation between 2025 and 2040 whileothers have decided to stop building new coal power plants beyond such plants already inconstruction, such as Poland. Moreover, more stringent emission thresholds, increased oradditional carbon pricing regulation or the discontinuance or reduction of current promotionsschemes, among other factors, may make certain forms of fossil power production less profitable.It cannot be ruled out that similar interventions may affect other business areas of ourGeneration division. For our Industrial Applications division, the business prospects may benegatively impacted by the introduction of new taxes on fossil fuels. Conversely, if governmentinterventions or regulations promoting hydrogen use (directly or indirectly) do not materialize asexpected, the business prospects of our New Energy Business may be negatively impacted.
The business of our Transmission division may be impacted by future EU legislation limiting or
banning the use of SF
6in gas-insulated switchgear. SF6-based gas-insulated switchgear contribute
a significant portion of our Transmission division’s revenues and profit, and there can be noassurance that our alternative solution is viable in the European market (see “ 3.2.2 We may be
unable to successfully develop and launch a portfolio of competitive and technologically-advanced products, services and solutions, and our research and development efforts may beunsuccessful. ”). A ban of SF
6in the EU would also force us to shift production sites outside
Europe to serve the unrestricted world market, which may adversely affect our reputation. Inaddition, the development and certification of, potentially, further SF
6-free products and
manufacturing of a parallel product line would entail significant efforts and expenses.Furthermore, demand for our Transmission products may suffer if the competent authoritiesdecide to reduce the fees grid operators may charge under applicable network regulations. Inaddition, ongoing grid expansion projects may face resistance and be subject to legal actionsseeking to stop or delay the completion of one or more projects and may result in overcapacities(see also “ 3.2.11 In connection with existing and potential future reorganization and cost savings
measures, we may incur substantial restructuring expenses and cash outflows. We may not beable to realize expected cost savings or we may fail to adjust our organizational andmanufacturing footprint in a timely manner or at all, and such reorganizations may not yield thetargeted benefits or may damage our reputation. ”). Our Transmission business is particularly
sensitive to changes and the increase in standardization requirements concerning networks,which may result in costly design changes and additional testing efforts. Should we be unable toimplement the required changes to our products and solutions in a timely manner, we risk losingmarket access in the affected business areas.
Our SGRE segment faces risks regarding the demand for its wind turbines due to regulatory and
policy changes in many jurisdictions. Although the general perception is that the decarbonization
46
trend will have a positive effect on the electricity production from renewables, including wind
energy, developers of wind power plants are dealing with the risk of industry specific policychanges and increasing regulation and, in part, activism, mostly in the form of demonstrationsand protests, by the local population. These policy changes and regulations could be due torenewable energy targets, environmental considerations ( e.g., noise, minimum distances to
populated areas, bird protection), or technical requirements ( e.g., regulations for grid
connections), but may also result from other factors such as the access to land for projectdevelopment, the overall permission process or subsidy rules. Such measures could significantlyhinder the growth of the onshore and offshore wind turbine market.
Our SGRE segment may also face local content requirements which may adversely impact our
operations in certain countries if such requirements were not met. In addition, various statesupport measures, such as fixed feed-in tariffs and tax breaks, to promote the wind energymarket will be reduced or phased out, which may reduce SGRE’s sales prices, revenues andprofitability. For example, in China, feed-in tariffs for onshore wind energy are expected to ceaseto apply as of 2021.
In addition, the requirements for obtaining export credit insurances are becoming increasingly
stringent, which may negatively affect Siemens Energy’s export business if such insurances cannotbe obtained or can only be obtained at an additional cost. This is particularly relevant for coal-fired power plants.
If there is a substantial adverse development in the regulatory and policy framework, this could
increase the costs and decrease future customer demand and this, in turn, could have a materialadverse effect on our competitive position and our business, financial position and results ofoperations.
3.4.4 Our risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect compliance
risks, which could result in investigations by authorities, fines, damage claims,payment claims, the termination of relationships with customers or suppliers andeven governmental exclusion from businesses (blacklisting) as well as reputationaldamage. Further, our internal controls could fail to detect business risks in time or atall.
We operate in numerous countries with 89 thousand employees (in the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2019, average, based on headcount), including certain countries with less stablepolitical, legal and regulatory regimes as well as inconsistent enforcement of laws andregulations. In addition, some of our customers and suppliers operate in countries which havebusiness environments, legal systems as well as political and cultural influences different fromthose which prevail in Western Europe. We have only limited influence over the day-to-dayoperations of our customers, suppliers and other partners. In particular, we have limited or noinsight on how our customers use the products we supply. All these circumstances inherentlycreate a risk that applicable legislation and regulations may be breached.
We have implemented a compliance system and organization, have established a code of conduct
and are providing regular training in order to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, e.g.,
anti-corruption, anti-bribery, antitrust, fair competition, anti-money laundering, data privacy,human rights, sanctions and other forms of export control regimes, including customs regulationsand other legislation such as data protection regulations, regulatory security requirements orcapital markets laws. Nevertheless, our existing compliance processes, systems and controls maynot be sufficient and our employees, customers, suppliers and other partners may not act incompliance with applicable statutory provisions and internal guidelines or process descriptions,for example, in procurement, production, proposals and sales. In particular, our projects areoften undertaken in high-risk countries where we are required to work with local projectpartners, subcontractors or suppliers, which we may not always be able to analyze entirely and inall details. With regard to sanctions and other export control regimes, sanctioned parties may beindirectly involved, making it difficult to detect their involvement. The high pressure arising froma fast changing, more complex and aggressive business environment and aggressive target
47
setting may foster non-compliant behavior of our employees. We face the risk that, as a result of
any violations of relevant laws and regulations, penalties, liabilities, fines or investigations maybe imposed on us or that our business may be adversely affected. In addition, our compliancesystem and monitoring capabilities may not be sufficient to promptly detect current complianceissues, identify past violations or prevent damage from fraud or similar crimes in the Group, ashas happened in the past in individual cases. Furthermore, changes in applicable laws andregulations, new guidance by competent authorities or interpretations of laws and regulationsby the courts pose additional challenges for our compliance systems. For example, the judgementof the European Court of Justice of July 16, 2020, which annulled the EU-US Privacy Shield, couldlead to additional costs for complying with new standards, or potential breaches of data privacyrules, which could result in fines, reputational damage or other negative consequences for us.
For example, our SGRE segment is currently investigating a number of possible compliance
violations relating to its Indian subsidiary. To date, only violations of internal control regulationshave been identified, and it is not yet clear whether there have been any further complianceviolations and the extent of these violations. Regarding our Gas and Power segment, we haveidentified a business area that received, during a bidding process, confidential competitor andcustomer information, which may have negative consequences for us.
Inappropriate behavior or any compliance breaches could lead to legal proceedings against us,
criminal, regulatory and/or other fines, sanctions, court orders affecting future conduct,forfeiture of profits, rescission of existing contracts, exclusion from certain businesses (so-called“blacklisting”), potential damages, loss of licenses and certifications or other restrictions, which,in turn, might limit our ability to pursue strategic projects and transactions that may beimportant for our business.
Furthermore, while we have established an internal control system based on internationally
recognized industry standards, designed to help us achieve important business objectives andsustain and improve business performance, there can be no assurance that this system willeffectively detect business risks in time or in all cases.
Involvement in potential non-compliance proceedings and investigations could harm our
reputation and that of our management, lead to the loss of customers and have a negativeimpact on our brands and on our efforts to compete for new customers and new orders.Customers and/or third parties could also initiate legal proceedings against us for substantialfinancial sums.
If our risk management or internal controls are not successful at preventing or detecting such
risks, we may be liable for fines, damage claims, payment claims and may suffer reputationaldamage and the termination of relationships with customers or suppliers, each of which couldhave a material adverse effect on our reputation, competitive position and our business, financialposition and results of operations.
3.4.5 We may be unable to adequately protect and defend our IP and know-how or may
infringe on third-party IP rights.
In close alignment with the product development process, we regularly apply for new patents
and actively manage our IP portfolio to maintain and enhance our technological position and tosupport our business. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, preserve andprotect our IP rights will be completely adequate. This risk is further exacerbated by the fact thatwe have been pursuing a more selective strategy in recent years when filing for new patents,which is aimed at reducing costs while at the same time adequately protecting our innovations.
Our IP rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages, particularly in
foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an IP portfolio or jurisdictions that do nothave strong IP rights or do not enforce such rights rigorously. The weakening of protection ofour trademarks, patents and other IP rights could also adversely affect our business. Some of ourIP and know-how is not protected by registered IP rights, as we consider the disclosure of tradesecrets connected with a registration to be more harmful for us than the risk of secrecy
48
violations. Therefore, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our
employees, but cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective to protect our know-how.
We are a party to a number of license agreements that afford us rights to IP that is necessary or
useful to our business, including licenses granted by Siemens. Our success depends in part on theability of us and our licensors to obtain, maintain and sufficiently enforce our IP rights, as well aslicensed IP rights, we have commercialized. Without protection for the IP rights we have filedwith the respective patent office and license, other companies might be able to offersubstantially identical products, which could adversely affect sales of our products and,ultimately, of our competitive position. Also, there can be no assurance that we will be able toobtain or renew from third parties the licenses to IP rights we need in the future, and there is noassurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms.
Our products are proprietary developments but their basic designs sometimes resemble
competing products. Although, we implemented processes designed to prevent that our productsor parts thereof unintentionally infringe IP rights of third parties (in particular patents,trademarks and design rights), there can be no guarantee that our prevention mechanisms willdetect infringements in time or at all. If we infringe third-party rights, we may be liable fordamages as well as litigation costs and may have to withdraw goods already produced from themarket or purchase a license to use such rights.
If protections for our IP prove inadequate, if we are unable to successfully defend and enforce
our IP rights and confidentiality agreements, or if we infringe third-party IP rights, this may havea material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
3.4.6 We are subject to environmental, health and safety as well as other regulatory
requirements and risks, as a result of which we may incur significant costs, liabilitiesand obligations.
The majority of the industries in which we operate are highly regulated. For example, certain of
our, or our suppliers’, production processes require, and certain of our products contain,chemicals or other substances which are subject to various laws and regulations, and we have toadhere to stringent occupational health and safety laws and regulations not only in ourproduction facilities but also, among others, on project sites and at customer locations. Currentand future EHS and other governmental regulations, or changes thereto, may require us tochange the way we run our operations and could result in significant increases in our operatingor production costs. Furthermore, due to the high risk profile of some of our work we see the riskof potential EHS incidents as well as potential non-compliance with EHS regulations affectingSiemens Energy and our contractors or sub-suppliers, resulting for example in serious injuries,penalties, loss of reputation and internal or external investigations as well as project delays.Especially in emerging market environments with a less mature culture in relation to EHS theremay be a risk of serious and/or fatal accidents.
In addition, while we have procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable
governmental regulations in the conduct of our business operations, violations of applicablegovernmental regulations either by us or by third parties that we contract with, includingconsortium partners, suppliers or service providers whose activities may be attributed to us, maynot be fully excluded. Any such violations particularly expose us to the risk of liability, penalties,fines, reputational damage or loss of licenses or permits that are important to our businessoperations. We could also face liability for damage or remediation for environmentalcontamination at the facilities we own, lease, design or operate. This risk is further exacerbatedby the fact that much of the real estate used by Siemens Energy was acquired when such realestate had already been in industrial use. Siemens Energy, thus, cannot guarantee that such realestate was always operated in line with EHS regulations, but may, nevertheless, be heldresponsible for the consequences of a failure to do so. With regard to certain environmentalrisks, we maintain liability insurance. We may incur environmental losses beyond the insurancelimits, or outside the coverage, of such insurance, and such losses may have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Risks in relation to EHS may
49
be exacerbated in cases where we are, either due to a lack of adequate and experienced
contractors, preferences by our consortium partners or customers for specific contractors, forcedto work with contractors with no or inadequate EHS experience on construction sites. In suchcases, we may not be able to uphold our own EHS standard approach and practices. Furthermore,we may have to allocate additional resources or incur additional costs to align our EHS standardapproach and practices with that of our contractors.
Furthermore, due to our global operations, we have a large number of employees in many
different jurisdictions with different, sometimes conflicting, EHS standards, which makescompliance with these standards more complex. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that inindividual cases, certain employees may have insufficient knowledge about binding internationaland local requirements in this field. We may also be inadequately prepared to respond tounexpected regulatory enforcement actions. Increasingly, compliance and enforcement of EHSstandard is becoming part of financing terms for projects, and we may fail to accurately interpretand apply these standards, which may jeopardize the financing of our projects.
3.4.7 Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient and insurance premiums may increase.
We maintain insurance coverage in relation to a number of risks associated with our business
activities, including third-party (product) liability, property damage and business interruption,environmental damage, directors and officers liability, construction, transport and vehicleinsurance. These insurance policies may not cover all losses or damages resulting from thematerialization of any of the risks. There can moreover be no assurance that our insuranceproviders will continue to grant coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at all. In addition,there are risks left intentionally uninsured, and we, therefore, have no insurance against theseevents. Furthermore, agreed limits and other restrictions ( e.g., exclusions) within the insurance
coverage may prove to be too low or inadequate for compensating potential damages or losses,ultimately resulting in a gap in the insurance coverage. If we sustain damages for which there isno or insufficient insurance coverage, or if we have to pay higher insurance premiums orencounter restrictions on insurance coverage, this may have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial position and results of operations. The risk of obtaining insurance coveragecould become more costly given changing market conditions due to high profile cases in therecent past and the economic downturn.
3.4.8 Our tax burden could increase due to changes in tax laws and regulations or their
application or interpretation, as a result of current or future tax audits, or transferpricing adjustments.
We operate in nearly all countries of the world and therefore are subject to many different tax
regulations. Our tax burden could increase due to changes in tax laws or their application orinterpretation, or as a result of current or future tax audits. Changes in tax laws or regulations,tax treaties or any change in position by the relevant authorities regarding the application,administration and interpretation (including any form of administrative guidance or through theinterpretation by courts) in any applicable jurisdiction, could result in higher tax expenses andincreased tax payments (prospectively or retrospectively). Furthermore, these changes couldparticularly impact our tax receivables and tax liabilities as well as deferred tax assets anddeferred tax liabilities. In addition, the uncertain legal environment in some regions could limitour ability to enforce our rights. As a globally operating organization, we conduct business incountries subject to complex tax rules, which may be interpreted in different ways. Furthermore,changes in fiscal regulations or in the interpretation of tax laws by the courts as well as futurechanges in interpretations or developments of tax regimes by the tax authorities may also have amaterial adverse effect on our business situation, financial condition, cash flows and results ofoperations.
We are regularly audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions and we continuously identify
and assess relevant risks, and an assessment of the relevant tax authorities could lead toadditional tax burdens or other detrimental consequences. Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co.KG (to be renamed Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co. KG, “ SE Global GmbH & Co. KG ”) as well
50
as the German and other foreign subsidiaries belonging to the Siemens Energy Group are or will
likely be subject to tax audits by the respective tax authorities on a regular basis. For instance,the Mexico division of our SGRE segment is subject to tax audits for the fiscal years 2013 and2014. Additionally, the India division is subject to audits for the fiscal years 2010/2011 through2017/2018 and a Philippine subsidiary is subject to a tax audit relating to the year 2018.Furthermore, some of the Siemens Energy Group entities are involved in pending tax disputeswith local tax authorities in several jurisdictions. As a result of current or future tax audits orother reviews by the tax authorities or tax disputes, material additional taxes could be imposedon our Siemens Energy Group companies exceeding the provisions reflected in our financialstatements. For instance, the original treatment of a tax-relevant matter in a tax return, taxassessment or otherwise could later be found incorrect, the validity of our tax groups for pastand current periods could be challenged, and additional taxes, interest, penalty payments and/orsocial security payments could be assessed on any of our companies. Such (re-)assessment may bedue to an interpretation or view of laws and/or facts by tax authorities in a manner deviatingfrom our view and may in particular emerge as a result of tax audits or other review actions bythe relevant tax authorities or tax disputes pending before the tax courts. For instance, severaltax disputes of the Brazilian Siemens Energy Group companies are pending before the Braziliantax courts. This could lead to a significant increase in our tax obligations, either as a result of therelevant tax payment being assessed directly against us or as the result of us becoming liable forthe relevant tax as a secondary obligor due to the primary obligor’s (such as, for example, anemployee) failure to pay. Some companies of our Siemens Energy Group have been and are stillsignificantly benefitting from a preferential tax treatment, such as the preferential tax status ofcertain of our Chinese subsidiaries which, under Chinese tax law, are classified as “high and newtechnology enterprise” (HNTE) and thus are eligible for a lower income tax rate. If a preferentialtax treatment was denied with retroactive effect or is no longer granted in the future, this wouldhave an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Several of oursubsidiaries have considerable tax loss carry forwards, some of which have been capitalized asdeferred tax assets in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending onSeptember 30, 2019. The utilization of tax loss carry forwards, however, may be restricted underapplicable tax laws, for instance, if they cannot be carried forward indefinitely or if they forfeitupon occurrence of a certain events ( e.g., a direct or indirect transfer of shares or a change of
control). If tax loss carry forwards can no longer be set-off against future taxable profits, thiswould generally increase our future tax burden (for further details with respect to the separationsee “ 3.5.13 In the separation from Siemens Group and in particular in the Spin-Off, unutilized tax
loss carry forwards and interest carry forwards could have been forfeited. ” below). In addition,
any such restriction may require a write-down of the deferred tax assets in our consolidatedfinancial statements. This would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.
Because we operate in numerous jurisdictions, we are exposed to tax risks, in particular with
regard to the so-called “transfer pricing” rules that apply in several jurisdictions and in relationto cross-border business relationships. Pursuant to such rules, related enterprises are obligated toconduct any inter-company transactions per conditions which would also apply among unrelatedthird parties concluding comparable agreements (so-called “at arm’s length principle”) and toprovide sufficient documentation thereof, subject to the rules applicable to them in the relevantjurisdiction. Even though we have established a transfer pricing model aimed at being compliantwith domestic and international transfer pricing regulations, it cannot be excluded that one ormore foreign tax authorities might not agree with, and thus challenge, our implemented transferpricing rules. The consequence might be double taxation in two or more countries, which couldpotentially only be mitigated or avoided by means of a mutual agreement procedure betweenthe relevant tax authorities or certain unilateral measures. Furthermore, transfer pricing risksmay increase in the future as intra-Group cross-border business grows or changes against thebackground of the digitalization and as the tax authorities’ interpretation of the arm’s lengthprinciple evolves over time. For example, some of our subsidiaries sell goods and/or provideservices to foreign subsidiaries. These companies must fulfill special requirements regarding thedocumentation of transfer prices according to special tax laws, such as the German Foreign TaxAct ( Außensteuergesetz ) or similar applicable national laws and regulations regarding OECD
51
requirements. Our documentation may be considered to be insufficient by the relevant tax
authorities or transfer prices may be considered to be inadequate or inadequately justified. Thismay result in penalties and additional tax payments. Companies of our Group could be involvedin transactions with the existing shareholders of the Company and/or parties related to theexisting shareholders. Such transactions, in order to be recognized for income tax purposes, alsoneed to comply with the arm’s length principle. In case of any such transactions being found notto be at arm’s length, this could lead to the assessment of additional taxes payable by companiesof our Group and thus negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financialposition.
3.4.9 We depend, with respect to certain activities, on permits, licenses, approvals,
certifications and exemptions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able torenew all necessary licenses, certifications and similar permits required for ouroperations in a timely manner.
Certain of our activities depend on permits, licenses, approvals, certifications and/or exemptions
in different jurisdictions in order to operate our business. For example, we are exposed to risksassociated with approvals when building and operating production facilities and require certaincertifications for our plants, which must be regularly renewed. Furthermore, our customersincreasingly require that we obtain additional certifications in order to consider engaging us. Thenecessary validation and certification processes are often complex, time-consuming and costly,and may be influenced by factors that are beyond our control. Also, occupational health andsafety incidents may cause certain certifications to be suspended or revoked. In addition, relevantregulatory authorities may not grant licenses, approvals, certifications, exemptions anddispensations as quickly as anticipated, which may result in project delays or unused capacities. Inaddition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our permits, licenses,approvals, certifications, exemptions and dispensations upon their expiration within the requiredtimeframe or at all.
With respect to our SGRE segment, the governmental support for the wind industry in the form
of subsidies and similar schemes (see “ 3.1.8 The wind power industry faces structural market
changes, in particular declining subsidy levels, and there can be no guarantee that SiemensGamesa Renewable Energy will succeed in addressing the resulting challenges. ”), and the
granting of permits and licenses for the operation of wind power plants (including in relation toa wind power plant’s construction, environmental impact, grid connection and feeding-in ofpower) currently constitute an important form of governmental and administrative support forinvestments in the wind power industry. Any decrease or elimination of such (indirect)government support in any jurisdiction, including political or policy changes towards the windindustry and/or in relation to the cost, timing and conditions required to obtain permits andlicenses for wind power plants (such as statutory minimum distances between wind power plantsand populated areas), could have a negative impact on the market for wind power in thatjurisdiction and, consequently, could reduce the demand for our SGRE segment’s wind powerequipment and its revenues from sales.
If we are unable to secure permits, licenses, approvals, certifications and exemptions, our
activities may be disrupted and this could have a material adverse effect on our competitiveposition and our business, financial position and results of operations.
3.4.10 We are subject to risks relating to change-of-control clauses, which may result in
termination or in renegotiation of contracts, potentially with less advantageousterms for us. Such change-of-control clauses may be triggered when the Spin-Offbecomes effective and we may not always be able to obtain a waiver, amendment ornovation.
Several agreements entered into by Siemens Energy contain change-of-control clauses. In case of
a change of control, any of the parties is entitled to terminate the relevant agreement. Thesetypes of provisions apply to certain agreements entered into between Siemens Energy with thirdparties or with Siemens AG, including the preferred financing agreements with Siemens,licensing agreements pursuant to which we are entitled to use the “Siemens” brand (see
52
“3.5.11 Under certain conditions, we may lose the right to use the “Siemens Energy” or “Siemens
Gamesa” brands, which could leave us without a consistent brand across our business activities orentirely without an established brand. ” below), an agreement regarding a strategic alliance
between the parties, covering also the supply of Siemens products to our SGRE segment,agreements for the contracting of financial derivatives between both companies. Furthermore,Siemens has a right to request the sale back of certain IP relating to our power plants controlsystem SPPA-T3000 which has been transferred by Siemens to Siemens Energy if a third partydirectly or indirectly acquires control over Siemens Energy. Additionally, in case of a change ofcontrol event, our SGRE segment may have to pay significantly higher fees for guarantees issuedin the favor of its customers.
Certain contracts of Siemens Energy made with consortium partners, suppliers, customers and
other contractual partners include change of control provisions allowing for termination, inparticular if the new controlling party is the other party’s competitor. After Spin-Off Completion,Siemens AG will no longer be the majority shareholder of Siemens Energy. This may trigger thechange-of-control clauses in certain contracts. While we have approached consortium partners,suppliers, customers and other contractual partners with contracts containing achange-of-control clause, it is uncertain whether and which contract partners will make use oftheir rights, which may result in loss of contracts, an obligation of Siemens Energy to findalternative suppliers and partners, potentially at a higher cost, or develop appropriate in-housefunctions.
Specific provisions regarding a change of control are for example contained in the IP agreement
between Siemens AG and Rolls-Royce plc relating to our aero-derivative gas turbine business.Once this agreement is transferred to Siemens Energy a provision will apply to us, according towhich, if a competitor of Rolls-Royce plc. acquires direct or indirect control of Siemens Energy(whereby the acquisition of 30% of Siemens Energy’s shares implies the acquisition of control),Siemens Energy is obligated to sell the aero-derivative gas turbine business to a company that isnot a competitor of Rolls-Royce within 12 months of such acquisition of control. If the business isnot sold, the licenses granted by Rolls-Royce to Siemens Energy will be automatically terminated.
3.5 Risks Related to Our Separation from the Siemens Group
3.5.1 Our Gas and Power segment and, to a lesser extent, our SGRE segment may lose
business opportunities and face a negative perception of our stand-alone positionfollowing our separation from the Siemens Group. Further, as a stand-alone group,we may not be able to satisfy financial or technical requirements under publicprocurement laws.
In the past, our Gas and Power segment benefited to some extent from the business activities of
the Siemens Group, and vice versa, in particular regarding the sale of our transmission productsby Siemens’ “Smart Infrastructure” segment. It cannot be ruled out that, following the significantreduction of Siemens’ stake in Siemens Energy AG following the Spin-Off, we will no longerbenefit from this cooperation as much as we used to. We may also lose business opportunities wepreviously enjoyed because our business partners took into consideration other businessopportunities relating to the entire Siemens Group when they entered into business relationswith us. We also face the risk that a contractual partner may not agree to transfer a contract or abinding offer (entered into or submitted prior to our separation from Siemens) from Siemens toSiemens Energy. In such case, we may have to execute on such contracts as a sub-contractor oragent of Siemens. This situation could result in losing contractual partners and/or businessopportunities if contractual partners are then unwilling to continue their relationship withSiemens Energy. As such transfers usually require the consent of the counterparty, counterpartiessuch as customers or suppliers may use the consent requirement as leverage to enter intorenegotiations or make use of their contractual termination rights. Similarly, objections tocontract transfers could also cause us to lose access to current or future IP rights which werelicensed to Siemens and may result in restricted access to certain business fields.
53
We face the risk that the new stand-alone position of Siemens Energy may be negatively
perceived by potential consortium partners, suppliers, customers and their lenders, employeesand other stakeholders. For example, customers of Siemens’ former Gas and Power business maybe reluctant to place orders with Siemens Energy, e.g., because of a less favorable credit rating or
insufficient capabilities to finance projects, or we may experience increased difficulties to recruitand to retain talent and key experts. To a lesser degree, this risk is also relevant for our SGREsegment, especially with a view to offshore projects.
Furthermore, private-sector clients or public procurement laws often require that a bidder
demonstrates certain qualifications, e.g., by demonstrating that the bidder has been active with
a registered local company for a certain number of years, sufficient capitalization, or technicalqualifications, e.g., by demonstrating a track record of relevant projects. While Siemens has
permitted us using references of projects we executed as part of Siemens Group, there can be noassurance Siemens will cooperate in relation to such references projects or that public authoritieswill accept such references as references demonstrating our capabilities as a stand-alonecompany.
3.5.2 We may face difficulties in satisfying certain treasury and finance requirements as
well as performing certain services and functions that historically were provided bythe Siemens Group.
As our Gas and Power segment had formerly been a fully-integrated part of the Siemens Group,
we have relied on financial, administrative and other resources (such as services related, forexample, to taxes, legal and contract management, IT, corporate communications, procurement,human resources, internal audit, compliance, real estate, (cyber-)security, accounting andfinancing, including treasury, guarantees, insurance and pension management) of the SiemensGroup. Following the Spin-Off, the Siemens Group will continue to provide some of these servicesand function-related services for a limited period of time under transitional service agreementsas well as under long-term service agreements and other individually negotiated agreements.Such service agreements will, however, not replace these services to the same extent, or may notfunction as efficiently, or may not fully capture the organizational and commercial benefits theGroup’s business has enjoyed as a fully-integrated part of the Siemens Group. It is also possiblethat such service agreements may be insufficient to cover our future needs. For example,accounting complexities resulting from our separation from Siemens are expected to make ourfuture financial reporting significantly more complex, and we may not be able to ensure accurateand timely reporting of our financial results. Further, the transitional and long-term serviceagreements may contain terms and conditions that may prove to be unfavorable. In addition, ifthe Siemens Group fails to perform the services provided for under the various serviceagreements, this may result in operational problems or liabilities towards third parties andincreased costs for us. Furthermore, if, after the expiration or termination of the transitionalservice agreements, we fail to set up the relevant functions by ourselves or to replace thetransitional services with third-party services in a timely manner or on reasonable terms, we mayexperience operational problems, become liable towards third parties and incur increased costs.To a lesser degree, SGRE could also be affected as it also has transitional services agreements inplace with the Siemens Group.
Moreover, due to cost reasons, long-term (currency) hedges are expected to be replaced with
short-term hedges resulting in a higher risk exposure. In connection with the Spin-Off, significanthedging positions will be transferred to Siemens Energy, which could be more costly thananticipated. In case of a termination of the existing hedging positions, the market values of thederivative transactions need to be settled between the relevant parties which could result insubstantial short-term payment obligations of Siemens Energy.
After our separation from Siemens, we may not be able to continue to rely on certain waivers
and exemptions granted under capital markets regulations, including under the EuropeanUnion’s European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), to pursue derivatives trading,clearing and collateralization as well as for certain treasury financing operations of non-financialcompanies for both Group-internal and external activities without having to obtain a license. If
54
we fail to obtain required waivers and exemptions in time or at all we may be required to set-up
systems for external reporting or have to procure services externally at increased costs.
In particular, with respect to our working capital requirements and capital for our general
corporate purposes – including acquisitions, research and development and capital expenditures– the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency denominated receivables, payables,debt, guarantees, firm commitments and forecast transactions, as well as interest rate changerisks, credit risks associated with contractual partners ( e.g., banks and customers) and market
price risks ( e.g., commodities or foreign exchange) have all historically been managed by or via
the Siemens Group. Other corporate finance and treasury services (including insurance andpension management services) have historically been managed as part of the treasury andfinancing policies and procedures of the Siemens Group. Following the Spin-Off, our corporatefinance and treasury functions will continue to depend on the Siemens Group for certain financeand treasury IT tools for a transitional period of 8 to 24 months and potentially beyond. Uponexpiration of such support service agreements (or if we decide to terminate them or they areterminated upon notice by Siemens), there can be no guarantee that we will be able to replacesuch tools in a timely and cost-efficient manner, which could negatively impact our businessoperations and results.
There is a risk that guarantees attributable to the Siemens Energy business contain rating trigger
clauses which oblige Siemens Energy (in case of transferred contracts) to replace such guaranteesthrough alternative securities, e.g., bank guarantees or surety bonds, in case the rating of the
guarantor falls below a defined level. Furthermore, fees for existing or new guarantees, suretyexposures or parent company guarantees may increase significantly, especially for guaranteesrelating to long-term service contracts. In an unfavorable financial markets environment suchfees may rise disproportionately for Siemens Energy when compared to Siemens.
In the stand-alone set-up following the Spin-Off, we intend to obtain financing from banks,
public offerings or private placements of debt, convertible or potentially equity securities. Thecost of obtaining third-party funding for our business could be higher than under the financingreceived from the Siemens Group prior to the separation. In addition, third-party providers ofdebt financing, such as banks, may not be willing or, due to internal thresholds or otherlimitations, able to provide or extend credits or other forms of debt financing to us in the firstmonths after spin-off because they have already provided similar financing to other entities ofthe Siemens Group and it may take time to adjust credit lines and transfer such exposures. Whileour SGRE segment is mostly financing itself, SGRE and other Siemens Energy Group companiesform a so-called “single borrower unit” ( Kreditnehmereinheit ) (see “ 3.3.4 Our business and the
businesses of our customers and suppliers require access to significant credit and guarantee linesand other financing instruments. Our business activities could be negatively affected if we areunable to meet our capital requirements in the future, for example in weak financial marketenvironments, as a result of a significant deterioration of our credit standing or of a breach of acredit facility agreement, or if access to capital becomes more expensive. Our business activitiescould be similarly negatively affected if our customers or suppliers do not have access tofinancing on economically viable terms. ”). The same applies to any other kind of product we may
decide to, or be required to, purchase or obtain from banks, insurance companies or other thirdparties ( e.g., hedging instruments or guarantees). Furthermore, we cannot rule out that our
credit rating may be negatively impacted if SGRE S.A.’s ratings were subject to a downgrading,and vice versa.
3.5.3 We are subject to tax risks due to the separation from the Siemens Group
The separation from the Siemens Group and the grouping of activities and assets that shall form
part of the Siemens Energy Group was implemented by way of reorganization measures underGerman law ( e.g., spin-off) and comparable measures under the laws of other jurisdictions as
well as certain carve-out measures. In the course of these separation measures, a multitude ofassets have been transferred. In addition, numerous contractual intercompany relations betweenSiemens and Siemens Energy (for instance, financing arrangements) had to be terminated,sometimes prematurely and/or against the payment of an arms’ length termination fee. In this
55
respect, it cannot be ruled out that the envisaged tax treatment of such measures will be
challenged by the tax authorities and that additional taxes, for instance, income taxes, VAT,stamp duties or de-grouping charges, will be assessed, for example due to a denial of certainexemptions or of input VAT-deductions, or a different valuation of the transferred assets, or thatloss-carry-forwards will be utilized as a consequence of such measures which could result in areduction of deferred tax assets.
As a general rule, the taxes arising in the course of the separation of the Siemens Energy Business
shall be borne by the entity which owes such taxes as statutory taxpayer. Hence, e.g., in the event
that the Siemens Energy Business was separated by way of reverse carve-out measures, the taxburden and risks which result from such measure or relate to the carved out business remain withentities of the Siemens Energy Group, although the transferred assets do not belong to theSiemens Energy Business.
Furthermore, under the Group Separation Agreement ( Konzerntrennungsvertrag ), Siemens
Energy AG shall procure that certain assets contributed to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG arerecognized at their tax book values and the required application with the competent tax office isfiled in time. If Siemens Energy AG violates such obligations and taxes are imposed on SiemensAG or Siemens Beteiligungen Inland GmbH (“ SBI GmbH ”), both of which hold shares in the
Company, or their loss carry forwards for corporate income and trade tax purposes are reduced,Siemens Energy AG shall compensate Siemens AG or SBI GmbH. SBI GmbH has also contributed alimited partnership interest ( Kommanditanteil ) in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG to Siemens Energy
AG in return for granting shares in Siemens Energy AG. In this regard, Siemens Energy AG isobligated to recognize this partnership interest at tax book value and to file the requiredapplication with the competent tax office in time. If these obligations are violated, SiemensEnergy AG is liable towards Siemens AG or SBI GmbH if taxes are imposed on them or their losscarry forwards for corporate income tax purposes are reduced. The Group Separation Agreementfurther contains provisions in relation to shares held by Siemens AG or SBI GmbH that are subjectto a lock-up period ( sperrfristbehaftete Anteile ) for tax purposes in connection with the
separation of the Siemens Energy business. If a contribution gain ( Einbringungsgewinn )i s
assessed, the tax consequences at the level of Siemens AG and SBI GmbH together with the tradetax arising at the level of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG may result in a total cash-out of up to amedium three digit million euro amount. Such tax cash-out may be compensated only partially bycorresponding tax benefits, for which the cash effect may only arise over time. In case SiemensEnergy AG caused such assessment of the contribution gain ( e.g., by violating the obligation to
procure that Siemens Energy entities apply for tax book values or by triggering an eventpursuant to section 22 (1) sentence 6 of the German Transformation Tax Act(Umwandlungssteuergesetz )), Siemens Energy AG shall compensate Siemens AG or SBI GmbH for
the resulting tax consequences. In case such contribution gain is caused by Siemens AG or SBIGmbH, Siemens Energy AG may have a compensation claim against Siemens AG for trade tax orthe reduction of trade tax loss carry-forwards resulting therefrom, whereas such claim isgenerally reduced by potential tax benefits arising for Siemens Energy AG and/or SE GlobalGmbH & Co. KG in case of a recognition of an increase amount in accordance with section 23 (2)of the German Transformation Tax Act ( Umwandlungssteuergesetz ) (“step-up”). To the extent
that the potential step-up benefit exceeds the amount, which Siemens AG would have to pay toSiemens Energy AG without the deduction of the step-up benefit, Siemens Energy AG is obligedto pay to Siemens AG an amount equal to this difference, even though the step-up benefit maynot have materialized in a cash effect yet, but only would materialize over time. Finally, theparties of the Group Separation Agreement ( Konzerntrennungsvertrag ) shall cooperate with
regard to tax matters and in case one party does not comply with its cooperation obligations, ithas to indemnify the other party, i.e., if Siemens Energy AG is not compliant it has to indemnify
Siemens AG or the affected Siemens Group entity.
For a transitional period, there may also be tax inefficiencies associated with the need to initially
set-up the corporate and/or business structure (including, among others, the conclusion ortransfer of customer contracts) and with the transfer of assets in certain jurisdictions. There are,for instance, jurisdictions in which the Siemens Energy Group will operate via newly created
56
permanent establishments which need to become registered for tax and, as the case may be,
particularly VAT purposes. Such process usually takes some time and, might be further delayed,due to external conditions (such as the current COVID-19 pandemic).
3.5.4 We have not previously operated as a stand-alone publicly listed entity and the
Spin-Off may result in significant additional expenses; we may be unable to operateefficiently and to fully implement our business strategy.
We have not previously operated as a stand-alone publicly listed entity and it is uncertain how
we will perform as such. Following Spin-Off Completion, we will be responsible for managing allof our corporate affairs ourselves. This may result in significant additional expenses, includingexpenses for the creation of our own financial and administrative support systems and forservices that will continue to be provided by the Siemens Group to us pursuant to transitionalservice agreements at prices intended to correspond to those obtainable from third parties, and/or expose the Company to an increased risk of legal, regulatory or civil costs or penalties.Furthermore, such transitional service agreements with Siemens and other agreements qualifyingas related-party transactions, in particular agreements that include volume commitments, bind usto Siemens during their term and may therefore limit the benefits we are able to realize from theseparation from Siemens if prices for the procured services change in the market. Conversely, weagreed on a general volume discount for the service contracts with Siemens relating to our Gasand Power segment. For example, for certain specified worldwide services, Siemens AG shallgrant a mid double digit percentage discount on the agreed prices in the first year after theSpin-Off Completion ( i.e., presumably until September 25, 2021), a low double digit percentage
discount in the second and third year; thereafter, no further discounts shall be granted. Forpurposes of our internal planning, we have assumed to benefit from these volume discounts tothe full extent. Accordingly, if we fail to obtain these discounts, the costs for services obtained bySiemens would be significantly higher than anticipated.
Significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and financial risk
management and business operations as a result of operating as a stand-alone publicly listedentity separate from the Siemens Group. The historical financial information in the form ofcombined financial statements included in this Prospectus relate to periods prior to ourseparation from Siemens and, thus, may not fully reflect the additional costs of us operating asan independent company (see “ 3.5.5 Our combined financial statements are based on
management judgments and a series of assumptions and estimates that may prove inaccurateand not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alonepublicly listed company. ”). Furthermore, we anticipate that our success in managing our business
as a stand-alone publicly listed entity and in successfully implementing our business strategy willdepend substantially upon our ability to develop the expertise necessary to comply with thenumerous regulatory and other requirements applicable to independent public companies. Inaddition, we will need to implement or adapt and monitor the necessary structures including aneffective internal control environment. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in atimely and effective manner and may face additional costs in doing so, which could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
We may be unable to realize the potential benefits associated with the separation from Siemens
as and when we expect. These benefits include our ability to focus on our own strategic andoperational plans, cost savings from a lean and efficient company setup, a more efficientallocation of capital and a distinct investment identity which allows investors to evaluate ourmerits, performance and future prospects separately from those of the Siemens Group. We maynot achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, amongothers, increased costs and liabilities when operating as a stand-alone company, the necessity toset up independent functions and processes and we may be more susceptible to marketfluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a fully-integrated part of the SiemensGroup, since our business will be significantly less diversified.
57
3.5.5 Our combined financial statements are based on management judgments and a
series of assumptions and estimates that may prove inaccurate and not necessarilyrepresentative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone publicly listedcompany.
We have no history of operating as a stand-alone company. The historical financial information
included in this Prospectus does not necessarily indicate what our Group’s results of operations,financial position, cash flows or costs and expenses will be in the future. Such historical financialinformation has been derived from Siemens Group’s historical financial and companyinformation, with certain adjustments being made. In order to reflect the assets, liabilities,income and expenses that fall within the scope of the Siemens Energy Group, variouscombination rules as well as a series of assumptions and estimates have been applied. Themanagement of Siemens Energy exercised considerable judgment in determining thesecombination rules, assumptions and estimates.
In addition, some of our subsidiaries were in the past part of the Siemens income tax group
(hereinafter referred to as the “ Siemens Tax Group ”) such that certain taxes were not imposed
on us. For purposes of the preparation of our combined financial statements, we havedisregarded the Siemens Tax Group and calculated income based on certain assumptions.
Therefore, the historical financial information contained in the Prospectus in the form of
combined financial statements does not necessarily reflect the financial position, results ofoperations and/or cash flows that we would have had if Siemens Energy Group had existed as aseparate group in the periods presented.
3.5.6 As a legal consequence of the Spin-Off, creditors of Siemens AG may be able to
enforce certain claims existing at the time of the Spin-Off against us, and there canbe no assurance that we are able to obtain indemnification from Siemens AG.
Our separation from Siemens was partly realized by way of a spin-off under the German
Transformation Act ( Umwandlungsgesetz ) or comparable corporate measures under the laws of
other jurisdictions. Under relevant laws, we may be held liable by creditors of Siemens AG whomay be able to enforce certain claims existing at the time of the Spin-Off against us. For example,in accordance with the provisions of the German Transformation Act, Siemens Energy AG isjointly and severally liable with Siemens AG for any liabilities of Siemens AG that were incurredprior to Spin-Off Completion if such liabilities fall due within five years, or in case of retirementbenefit obligations under the German Company Pension Act ( Betriebsrentengesetz ) ten years,
from publication of the Spin-Off in the commercial registers of Siemens AG. In the spin-off andtransfer agreement concluded between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG, Siemens AG agreedto indemnify Siemens Energy AG against any liabilities or obligations that remained with SiemensAG in the event that relevant claims are asserted against Siemens Energy AG. Should Siemens AGnot satisfy its obligations to indemnify Siemens Energy AG, this could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or prospects. Furthermore,existing creditors of Siemens AG could request Siemens Energy AG to provide security to theextent such creditors cannot obtain satisfaction of their claims and can demonstrate probablecause that the fulfillment of their claims will be jeopardized by the Spin-Off.
3.5.7 We are exposed to risks arising from indemnities which we have granted to Siemens
in connection with our separation from Siemens. In addition, as part of thisseparation, assets or liabilities may have been incorrectly allocated, which mayrequire us to transfer certain assets to or assume further liabilities from Siemens.
Our separation from Siemens was largely implemented on a country-by-country basis through the
transfer of the local Siemens Energy business to local entities which will form part of SiemensEnergy. The result of these business transfers is generally that the future local Siemens companiescan be held liable for obligations or that it is affected by other consequences from formeractivities attributable to the transferred Siemens Energy business. It has therefore been agreedthat Siemens Energy will indemnify the relevant local future Siemens companies from liabilities
58
attributable to the transferred Siemens Energy business. These indemnity obligations could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that we have, as part of our separation from Siemens,
erroneously received assets or liabilities attributable to Siemens Group. Conversely, assets orliabilities attributable to Siemens Energy may have remained with Siemens. If such erroneoustransfers of assets or liabilities or failures to transfer assets or liabilities are established, we maybe required to transfer assets to or assume liabilities from Siemens.
3.5.8 As we build our IT environment and transition our data to our own systems, we
could incur substantial additional costs and may suffer temporarily reduced quality ofIT services or business interruptions.
After Spin-Off Completion, a large part of our IT environment, including infrastructure, systems,
applications and related support and development functions will continue to be highlyintegrated and embedded in Siemens Group’s IT environment. Siemens Group will thereforecontinue to provide certain IT services to us, including infrastructure services, license services,systems and application services. However, we will also continue to install and implement ourown IT environment to support our critical business functions. In particular, we will transition ornewly introduce the IT systems for the Group including financial consolidation and reportingsystems, treasury, guarantee as well as insurance administration systems, central customerrelationship solutions, compliance, export control, customs and tax systems. We may incurtemporary interruptions in business operations and financing services if we cannot transitioneffectively from Siemens Group’s existing transactional and operational systems and data centersand the services that support these functions as we replace these systems with our own. We maynot be successful in effectively and efficiently implementing our new systems and transitioningour data and we may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currentlyanticipated. Any interruptions as we implement the new systems and replace parts of theSiemens Group’s IT services, or our failure to implement the new systems and replace the SiemensGroup’s services effectively and efficiently, could disrupt our business and expose us to liabilitytowards third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialposition and results of operations. In addition, we may incur proportionally higher costs thanplanned for our IT, as central or corporate IT systems and services are provided to a smaller base(e.g., the costs for software licenses as well as support and maintenance contracts proportionally
increases, as we cease to benefit from lower prices currently available due to larger volumepurchasing as part of Siemens Group).
3.5.9 As a stand-alone entity, our Gas and Power segment and, to a lesser extent, our SGRE
segment may be unable to continue benefiting from joint purchasing andprocurement terms with Siemens AG in the future.
Our Gas and Power segment has until recently been an integral part of Siemens and thus
benefited significantly from Siemens’ purchasing and bargaining power in procuring goods,technology, financing (including guarantees, hedges, letters of credit and other bank services),logistics and other services (including insurance, pension plans, legal and audit and IT services).Following the Spin-Off Completion, we will be a smaller and less diversified company thanSiemens. As a separate, stand-alone company, we may be unable to obtain goods, technologyand services at prices and on terms as favorable as those available to our Gas and Power segmentand, to a lesser extent, our SGRE segment prior to the separation from the Siemens Group. Inorder to continue to benefit from joint purchasing and procurement terms, Siemens Energy andSiemens AG entered into joint pooling agreements regarding our Gas and Power and our SGREsegment, respectively. Under these agreements, Siemens AG acts for Siemens Energy on theprocurement markets in respect of certain materials. After expiry or termination of the jointpooling agreements, we may fail to enter into individual agreements on similar or otherfavorable terms in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial position and results of operations.
59
3.5.10 In certain countries, carve-outs may be deferred or even fail or Siemens will retain
parts of the Siemens Gas and Power business. In these countries, limited access to thelocal markets, established facilities, research and development resources may have anadverse impact on our business prospects and operations. In addition, contractualagreements may require us to purchase the local business after termination of thecontract, which may result in significant cash outflows.
Following the Spin-Off Completion, Siemens will retain parts of the Siemens Gas and Power
business in Algeria, Greece, India, Indonesia and Pakistan. In these countries and certain adjacentsales territories, business activities of our Gas and Power segment will be carried out by localSiemens companies under agency and distributorship agreements under which the local Siemenscompanies are mostly appointed as sole selling agents with exclusive selling rights for certain gasand power products. Not being able to conduct our own sales activities in the relevant salesterritories may adversely impact our business prospects and results of operations. Furthermore,for Algeria, Greece, Indonesia and Pakistan, under framework agreements, we are required topurchase the business from the local Siemens companies if the framework agreement isterminated, which could result in significant cash outflows. This risk is further exacerbatedbecause Siemens could terminate the respective framework agreement before we have set upappropriate structure to acquire the respective operations.
In India, with the exception of one of our subsidiaries mainly active in the oil and gas compressor
market, business activities relating to our Gas and Power segment in India and certain adjacentsales territories (“ Indian Energy Business ”) will be carried out under an agency and
distributorship agreement by Siemens India, which is a listed company in which Siemens holds51% and we hold 24% of the shares (as of June 30, 2020). Furthermore, we have negotiated ashareholders’ agreement regulating the exercise of voting rights in Siemens India and theseparation of the Siemens and Siemens Energy business activities in certain cases. Theshareholders’ agreement also details principles of cooperation with respect to the Gas and Powerbusiness in India. Such agreements entail a number of risks, e.g.:
 we cannot dispose of our shares in Siemens India without Siemens’ consent; we have no direct or only limited access to the Indian market to carry out our Gas and Power
business and the results of operations relating to this market will to a significant extent berecognized by Siemens Group and not by Siemens Energy Group;
 we have no direct access to existing local manufacturing research, development and
engineering personnel and facilities of Siemens India that were previously part of Siemens’ Gasand Power engineering and manufacturing network, and are not allowed to establish newlocal manufacturing, research, development or engineering personnel or facilities in Indiawithout Siemens India’s discretionary consent. Furthermore, we are obligated to make certainannual volume commitments and have granted certain first and last call rights to SiemensIndia, which may require us to favor Siemens India in respect of certain products or servicesover our own manufacturing facilities or personnel;
 upon expiry of the shareholders’ agreement, or upon its termination by either party, we are
obliged to acquire the Indian Energy Business at fair market value and to return our 24% share(as of June 30, 2020) in Siemens India to Siemens. This may lead to significant cash outflows if,as is currently the case, the valuation of the Indian Energy Business exceeds the valuation ofour share in Siemens India, in which case we may, however, elect to acquire the balance of theIndian Energy Business that exceeds the valuation of our share in Siemens India over a periodof three years. Furthermore, we are obliged to indemnify Siemens against adverse taxconsequences which may arise in connection with the termination and the resulting transfer ofthe Indian Energy Business which may constitute a significant amount, in certain events oftermination, notably in the event the shareholders’ agreement is terminated by us forconvenience (which may make such termination unattractive to us) or in the event theshareholders’ agreement is terminated by Siemens as a result of a third party directly orindirectly acquiring more than 25% of the shares (which may be outside our control) in SEGlobal GmbH & Co. KG.
60
In addition, if certain carve-out measures were deferred or even fail, this could not only impact
our ability to conduct business in the relevant countries but also our position as a stand-alonecompany. Despite the carve-out being effective in most countries, certain follow-up activities maybe necessary to bring the respective local business fully into operation, such as the registration ofbranches or the application for business licenses, which may take longer than expected, as is,amongst other countries, currently the case in Iraq and the United Arab Emirates / Abu Dhabi,and if such follow-up activities are deferred or fail, there is the risk that we either (i) are not ableto conduct new local business directly but only through Siemens AG against a consideration to bepaid by Siemens Energy that may lead to a margin erosion or, if no workaround is available,(ii) will lose business opportunities. The same might be true for the applications for other permitsor certificates.
3.5.11 Under certain conditions, we may lose the right to use the “Siemens Energy” or
“Siemens Gamesa” brands, which could leave us without a consistent brand acrossour business activities or entirely without an established brand. Furthermore,Siemens could intensify competition with us, in particular under the “Siemens”brand, or it could allow our competitors to do so using the “Siemens” brand.
Under a Trademark and Name Use (Sub-)License Agreements (“ SE TLA ”) entered into on
March 31, 2020, between Siemens AG as licensor and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG as licensee, witheffect as of Spin-Off Completion, Siemens AG granted Siemens Energy (excluding SGRE) theexclusive right to, among other things, use the combined designation “Siemens Energy” withinour company name, internet and e-mail domains and the trademark “SIEMENS Energy” ascorporate mark and as product mark (the “ SE Mark ”) as well as the non-exclusive right to use
certain “Si-” product marks (the “ SE Licensed Designations ”).
Under the SE TLA, this right to use the SE Licensed Designations is generally limited to business
fields in which the Siemens segment Gas and Power was active as of October 1, 2019 or whichwere defined in the business mandate of this segment at that time (including certain productsand services that were the subject of research and development activities ongoing at that time)(the “ SE Current Field ”). If we enter business fields outside the SE Current Field, we can request
Siemens AG to expand the scope, the consent to such request shall not be unreasonablywithheld. However, if such request is denied, we must enter business fields outside the SECurrent Field through a separate legal entity that does not have the right to use the SE LicensedDesignations.
The SE TLA has an initial term of ten years and extends automatically unless terminated by either
party. During the term of the SE TLA, we are obligated to use the SE Licensed Designations in theSE Current Field as our master brand. Siemens AG has the right to terminate the SE TLA withimmediate effect subject to staggered transition periods in a number of instances, e.g.,i f
(i) Siemens holds less than 25% of the shares and/or voting rights in the Company (excludingshares directly or indirectly held by Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. or any other entity holding ormanaging plan assets under or in connection with Siemens Group’s benefit plans), provided thatsuch termination may become effective earliest on September 25, 2023, (ii) a substantialcompetitor of Siemens Group holds 15% or more of the shares and/or voting rights in theCompany, (iii) another person holds 25% or more of the shares and/or voting rights in theCompany, (iv) Siemens has a legitimate reason to believe that the reputation of “Siemens” ismaterially adversely affected, even where this is due to a situation beyond our control, (v) we failto establish and maintain certain best industry practices as defined in the SE TLA, or (vi) wematerially breach the SE TLA and such breach is not remedied.
SGRE S.A. as licensee concluded a Trademark and Name Use (Sub-)License Agreement with
Siemens AG as licensor on May 20, 2020 (the “ SGRE TLA ”). Under the SGRE TLA, Siemens AG
continues to grant SGRE the right to, among other things, exclusively use the combineddesignation “Siemens Gamesa” as part of its company name, internet and e-mail domains, andthe trademark “Siemens Gamesa” for new products, as well as the “SIEMENS” trademark forexisting products of the former Siemens wind power business (the “ SGRE Licensed
Designations ”). Under the SGRE TLA, the right to use the SGRE Licensed Designations is generally
limited to business fields in which SGRE was active prior to its formation in April 2017 but
61
excludes certain Gamesa Electric and Gamesa Energy Transmission products and services (the
“SGRE Permitted Activities ”). If SGRE enters into business fields outside of the SGRE Permitted
Activities, it may request Siemens AG to expand the scope, the consent to such request shall notbe unreasonably withheld. However, if such request is denied, SGRE must enter business fieldsoutside the SGRE Permitted Activities through a separate legal entity that does not have the rightto use the SGRE Licensed Designations.
The SGRE TLA has an initial term of ten years and extends automatically unless terminated by
either party. Siemens AG has the right to terminate the SGRE TLA with immediate effect subjectto staggered transition periods in a number of instances, e.g., if (i) the SE TLA is terminated,
(ii) Siemens Energy loses control over SGRE S.A., (iii) SGRE S.A. stops using the designation“Siemens” as part of its company name, (iv) Siemens has a legitimate reason to believe that thereputation of “Siemens” is materially adversely affected, even where this is due to a situationbeyond SGRE’s control, (v) SGRE fails to establish and maintain certain best industry practicesdefined in the SGRE TLA, or (vi) SGRE materially breaches the SGRE TLA and such breach is notremedied.
Any termination of the SE TLA and/or the SGRE TLA and, after the lapse of any transition periods
under such agreements, as the case may be, the resulting loss of the right to use the SE LicensedDesignations and/or the SGRE Licensed Designations may leave our Group with an inconsistentbranding across its business operations or may force us to operate under a new brand entirely.These risks are further exacerbated by the fact that the SE TLA and the SGRE TLA require us touse the “Siemens” brand as our master brand which precludes us from establishing a brandindependent from “Siemens” while using the licensed “Siemens” brands.
Our right to use the SE Mark is exclusive for the SE Current Field only for the combination of the
“SIEMENS” mark with “Energy”, but not for the standalone “SIEMENS” mark. SGRE’s right to usethe combined designation “Siemens Gamesa” is exclusive for the SGRE Permitted Activities.However, there are no “non-compete” undertakings by Siemens in favor of Siemens Energy orSGRE. Accordingly, we are already seeing competition by Siemens which may intensify, includingin areas on which we place strategic emphasis. Furthermore, Siemens may compete or it couldallow our competitors to compete with us, in particular under the designation and trademark“Siemens” in the SE Current Field or in the SGRE Permitted Activities. Any competition bySiemens or such competition by another licensee, in particular under the “Siemens” brand, couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
Additionally, if the Group is no longer able to use the SE Mark, SE Licensed Designations, the
SGRE mark, or SGRE Licensed Designations, it could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial position and results of operations.
3.5.12 Our market perception may be negatively influenced by Siemens Group’s image.
We use the combined “Siemens Energy” and “Siemens Gamesa” as product marks, corporate
marks and as part of our company names, business designations and main domains to operateour business. These designations clearly identify us with the Siemens Group, even though theCompany will no longer be a consolidated subsidiary of Siemens AG upon the Spin-OffCompletion. Our brand perception may be influenced by adverse developments in SiemensGroup. Negative publicity or reputational damage of any kind or problems associated withcompanies of the Siemens Group, even if unrelated to us and our business, could have adetrimental effect on our reputation and brand and, as a result, a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial position and results of operations. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that wehave to use the SE Licensed Designations and the SGRE Licensed Designations during the terms ofthe SE TLA and the SGRE TLA as master brands and therefore do not have an establishedalternative brand we could fall back to if we terminate the SE TLA and the SGRE TLA in the eventthat the reputation of “Siemens” is materially adversely affected.
62
3.5.13 In the separation from Siemens Group and in particular in the Spin-Off, unutilized tax
loss carry forwards and interest carry forwards could have been forfeited.
In Germany, unutilized losses for corporate income tax, trade tax and interest carry forwards are
forfeited in full if within a period of five years more than 50% of a corporation’s registered sharecapital or voting rights are directly or indirectly transferred to an acquiring party, affiliatedindividuals/entities or a group of acquirers with aligned interests, or a comparable change ofownership in the corporation occurs (harmful acquisition – schädlicher Beteiligungserwerb ). The
foregoing forfeiture rules are, however, subject to certain exceptions, e.g., losses and interest
carry forwards may be preserved to the extent the losses and interest carry forwards do notexceed the taxable hidden reserves in Germany. Unutilized losses for trade tax of a partnershipare in general forfeited to the extent a direct change of ownership occurs at the level of thepartnership.
In the course of the separation from Siemens Group, a harmful acquisition and/or change of
ownership could have occurred upon the Spin-Off of a limited partnership interest(Kommanditanteil ) in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, representing 55% of the total fixed capital
(Festkapital ) of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, and 55% of the shares in Siemens Gas and Power
Management GmbH, the sole general partner of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, and the precedingcontribution of the remainder of the limited partnership interest ( Kommanditanteil ) in SE Global
GmbH & Co. KG and the shares in Siemens Gas and Power Management GmbH to Siemens EnergyAG respectively. This may also occur in the future resulting in the risks stated above. Thereupon,German loss and interest carry forwards of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG or any of its subsidiariescould have been forfeited.
Comparable rules providing for a limitation on the utilization of loss carry forwards and similar
tax attributes also exist in other jurisdictions (for instance, in the United States). Therefore, theseparation also might have limited or excluded the utilization of such loss carry forwards orsimilar attributes of any Siemens Energy Group company that has previously been available.
3.5.14 We have to consider governance rules and legal protections afforded to minority
shareholders of SGRE as well as its independent financing activities.
We hold approximately 67% of the shares in SGRE S.A. and, following Spin-Off Completion, will
fully consolidate the SGRE results. In the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, and in thefiscal year ended September 30, 2019, our SGRE segment contributed total revenue of€6,615 million and €10,227 million, respectively, to the Total Segments’ revenue of
€19,942 million and €28,936 million, respectively. The segment further contributed €(631)
million and €481 million to the Total Segments’ Adjusted EBITA of €(1,171) million and
€1,069 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, and in the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2019, respectively. Our SGRE segment thus makes a significant contribution to theperformance of the Group. SGRE S.A. is a publicly listed company with external shareholders. Inthis context, governance rules as well as the legal protections afforded to minority shareholdersmay cause delays and increase the level of complexity related to the administrative interactionwith our SGRE segment.
Our SGRE segment finances itself independently from Siemens Energy. If its financial position
deteriorates, we may need to provide financial support to our SGRE segment with the additionalrisk that, compared to bank financing for SGRE, our claims would be subordinated.
3.6 Risks Related to Our Shareholder Structure
3.6.1 Siemens AG will retain a substantial shareholding in Siemens Energy AG following
completion of the Spin-Off and will be able to exercise a corresponding influence,and the interests of Siemens AG could come into conflict with the interests of otherinvestors.
Upon Spin-Off Completion, Siemens AG, SBI and Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. will directly and/or
indirectly hold 23.1%, 12.0% and 9.9%, respectively, of the Shares, while the remaining 55% will
63
be held by the shareholders of Siemens AG. In May 2020, the Company and Siemens AG and SBI
entered into a deconsolidation agreement ( Entherrschungsvertrag , the “ Deconsolidation
Agreement ”). In essence, under the Deconsolidation Agreement, Siemens AG and SBI undertake
vis-à-vis the Company to a level of self-restraint regarding the use of their voting rights in the
Company in order to ensure that they will not be able to carry a vote on their own in respect ofcertain essential matters. Such matters include the appointment and removal of the members ofthe Company’s supervisory board (the “ Supervisory Board ”), certain management matters
(Geschäftsführungsmaßnahmen ) brought before the shareholders’ meeting of the Company,
discharge ( Entlastung ) of the members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, votes of
non-confidence ( Vertrauensentzug ), board compensation matters and adoption ( Feststellung )o f
annual accounts if the shareholders’ meeting resolves on such approval. Further, Siemensundertakes vis-à-vis the Company that there will be a maximum of three Supervisory Board
members who are depending on Siemens, e.g., members of the executive board ( Vorstand )o f
Siemens AG. Members of the supervisory board ( Aufsichtsrat ) of Siemens AG are not considered
closely affiliated with Siemens for purposes of this threshold. The Deconsolidation Agreementshall commence on the day of the Spin-Off Completion and shall be effective at least until theend of the fifth general shareholders’ meeting following the general shareholders’ meeting atwhich the post-Spin-Off Supervisory Board is appointed. During this period, the DeconsolidationAgreement can only be terminated for good cause.
On matters not covered by the Deconsolidation Agreement or if the Deconsolidation Agreement
is terminated, Siemens AG may, depending on the shareholder presence at the generalshareholders’ meeting of the Company, be in a position to control the resolutions passed by thegeneral shareholders’ meeting of the Company with a simple majority of the votes cast or therepresented share capital. Matters not covered by the Deconsolidation Agreement includeresolutions concerning the distribution of dividends. Due to the expected attendance levels,Siemens will likely be able to control the resolutions on the distribution of dividends as long as itdoes not significantly reduce its post-Spin-Off shareholding in the Company. In addition, as longas Siemens AG holds more than 25% of the shares represented at the general shareholders’meeting, Siemens AG will be able to prevent resolutions from being adopted at the generalshareholders’ meeting of the Company which require a qualified majority of the votes cast and/orthe represented share capital. This may include, inter alia, capital increases to finance acquisitionsor for other purposes, structural measures ( e.g., approval of enterprise, merger, spin-off or other
major agreements and most changes to the articles of association). In connection with theexercise of its voting rights and/or the exercise of its contractual rights under agreements enteredinto with the Company or its subsidiaries, the interests of Siemens AG may be in conflict with theinterests of the other shareholders and the Company. In the event that Siemens AG does notparticipate in a capital increase proposed by the Company in the future, the Company’s efforts toraise new capital could be undermined.
Siemens AG may also sell, or announce to sell, the shares it holds in Siemens Energy at a certain
point of time thereby affecting the share price of Siemens Energy shares negatively.
3.6.2 Membership of the same individuals on boards of the Company and of Siemens as
well as other relationships with Siemens may result in conflicts of interest.
As of the date of the Prospectus, all members of the Supervisory Board are employees of Siemens.
Following Spin-Off Completion, Mr. Joe Kaeser and Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas, who are also servingon the executive board of Siemens AG, and Mr. Matthias E. Rebellius, who currently is anemployee of Siemens and is expected to become a member of the executive board of Siemens AGwith effect as of October 1, 2020, will be members of the Supervisory Board. Furthermore,Dr. Andrea Fehrmann, Mr. Jürgen Kerner and Mr. Hagen Reimer are expected to remainmembers of the supervisory board of Siemens AG following Spin-Off Completion. Since theinterests of Siemens AG and the Company will not necessarily always coincide or be aligned, theaforementioned dual mandates and other relationships of the Group’s board members withSiemens Group may in the future result in conflicts of interest for these persons.

3.7 Risks Related to the Shares and the Listing
3.7.1 Substantial sales of the Company’s Shares may occur in connection with the Spin-Off,
which could cause the price of the Shares to decline; such sales may also occur at alater stage. Furthermore, Siemens intends to significantly reduce its shareholding inthe Company within twelve to 18 months after the Spin-Off.
Upon Spin-Off Completion and after the listing of the Shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, it
is likely that a number of shareholders receiving Shares in connection with the Spin-Off will sellShares, and thus that the price of the Company’s Shares may initially decline significantly. Someof the reasons for such a fall in the share price could be that shareholders sell the Shares becausethey do not wish to invest in the activities which have been spun off and new investors do notbuy the Shares to the same extent, one reason being that no experience has yet been gainedwith Siemens Energy AG on a stand-alone basis. In particular, unlike the shares of Siemens AG,the Shares of Siemens Energy AG are likely not to be immediately listed in the DAX; this meansthat all existing investors who are required (due to their own investment guidelines, investmentrisk profiles or for other reasons) to invest in stocks of DAX companies would have to sell theShares they receive under the Spin-Off. There are no explicit lock-up agreements of shareholdersof which we are aware, including in respect of the shareholding held by Siemens followingSpin-Off Completion. Furthermore, Siemens intends to significantly reduce its shareholding in theCompany within twelve to 18 months after the Spin-Off, which could negatively affect the priceof the Company’s Shares. Moreover, Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. will initially hold a shareholdingof 9.9% in the Company following Spin-Off Completion. In view of the investment guidelines ofSiemens Pension-Trust e.V. and applicable asset diversification requirements, we cannot excludethat Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. will reduce its shareholding, which could result in additionalselling pressure and could therefor negatively affect the price of the Company’s Shares. Inaddition, New Shares attributable to the shares of Siemens AG which are traded in the form ofAmerican Depositary Receipts (ADR) in the U.S. will be sold by a representative of the depositaryonce the Spin-Off becomes effective and the proceeds (net of costs) will be paid to the ADRholders. Therefore, it is not unlikely that considerable selling pressure will develop immediatelyafter the Shares are admitted to trading. In addition, there is no assurance that an active andliquid market for the Shares will develop and if at any time Siemens AG or one or more othershareholders of the Company were to sell a substantial number of the Shares they hold, directlyor indirectly, in the Company, or if rumors arise in the market that such a sale may be imminent,the share price of the Company’s Shares may decline.
3.7.2 The market price and trading volume of the Company’s Shares may fluctuate
significantly and could decline following Spin-Off Completion for a variety ofreasons, and investors could lose some or all of their investment. Similarly, a declineof the share price and trading volume of SGRE S.A. could negatively affect theCompany’s share price.
The trading volume and price of the Company’s Shares may fluctuate significantly. The share
price is determined by the supply of and demand for the shares and may not necessarily reflectthe fair value of the Company. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the share price orresult in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of the Shares include, for example, ad hocdevelopments ( e.g., management changes), changes in profit estimates, fluctuations in our actual
or projected operating results, changes in our projected net sales, variations in quarterly results,failure to meet securities analysts’ expectations, the contents of published research reports aboutthe Company or the industry segments or securities analysts failing or ceasing to cover theCompany, actions by institutional shareholders, conflicts with anchor shareholders (in particularSiemens) and general market conditions or special factors influencing companies in the industryin general. For example, an increasing number of investors follow investment guidelines aimed atfurthering causes such as sustainability. If our product portfolio, which is still largely related tofossil power generation, is ineligible under such investment guidelines, investors may sell orrefrain from investing in Shares. Furthermore, we cannot rule out that even certain products,e.g., products for military applications or conventional components for nuclear energy
65
applications, could result in such ineligibility or have a negative connotation in the public
opinion with a material negative impact on our reputation. Fluctuations in the equity marketscould also cause the share price to decline, though such general fluctuations may not necessarilybe related to our business or short to mid-term prospects. In addition, the share price could alsodecline should rating agencies downgrade their rating of the Company or of its subsidiary SGRES.A. In addition, if Siemens Energy or SGRE were to revise previously communicated targets orguidance downwards, this could directly or indirectly negatively affect the share price of theCompany’s shares. Similarly, a decline of the share price and trading volume of SGRE S.A. couldnegatively affect the Company’s share price. If the share price of the Company’s Shares declines,which may be due to a variety of reasons, investors may be unable to resell their shares at orabove their purchase price and may lose some or all of their investment in the Company’s Shares.
3.7.3 The combined value of the Company’s Shares and the shares of Siemens AG
following the Spin-Off may not equal or exceed the value of the Siemens AG sharesprior to the Spin-Off.
Following the Spin-Off, the shares of Siemens AG will continue to be listed and will be traded on
the trading day following the day of the Spin-Off Completion taking such Spin-Off into account(ex spin-off trading). We cannot assure that the combined trading prices of the Siemens AGshares and the Company’s Shares as allocated to Siemens AG shareholders in accordance with theallotment ratio will be equal to or greater than the trading price of Siemens AG shares prior tothe Spin-Off Completion. Until the market has fully evaluated the business of the Siemens Groupexcluding the Siemens Energy business, as well as our business on a stand-alone basis, the price atwhich the Company’s Shares, and to a lesser extent Siemens AG shares, trade may be subject toextraordinary volatility.
3.7.4 Following Spin-Off Completion, the Company will be a holding company with no
material business operations of its own and will rely on operating subsidiaries toprovide the Company with the funds required to meet its financial obligations andmake dividend payments. Further, in case the Company has to recognize a significantimpairment on its interests in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, its ability to make dividendpayments could be limited.
Following Spin-Off Completion, the Company will be a holding company with no material
business operations of its own. The principal assets of the Company will be its direct interests inSE Global GmbH & Co. KG and indirect interests in its operating subsidiaries. As a result, theCompany will be dependent on these subsidiaries in order to generate the funds required tomeet the Company’s financial obligations and make dividend payments, if any.
The ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to make distributions and other payments to the
Company will depend on the subsidiaries’ earnings and is subject to various contractual andstatutory limitations. The amount and timing of such distributions depend on the laws of theoperating companies’ respective jurisdictions and such distributions may not arrive in time for thedividend payments of the Company and the Company would have to draw on its distributablereserves to enable dividend distributions.
Further, in case the Company has to recognize a significant impairment on its interests in SE
Global GmbH & Co. KG, its ability to make dividend payments would be dependent on anyresulting losses being compensated by distributable reserves and other profits such asdistributions from subsidiaries. An obligation to recognize such impairment may arise, amongother things, if the market capitalization of the Company is permanently below the book valueof approximately €13 billion at which the interests in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG are expected to
be recognized in the financial statements of Siemens Energy AG prepared in accordance with theGerman Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch ). Further, there can be no guarantee that any
resulting impairment loss could be offset by distributable reserves and other profits such asdistributions from subsidiaries.
66
If the Company does not receive sufficient distributions and other payments from its direct and
indirect subsidiaries at all or not in time or in case it has to recognize a significant impairment onits interests in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, it may be unable to meet its financial obligations and/or to make dividend payments.

Financial information in the Prospectus presented as“unaudited” in the tables in the Prospectus is not taken from the Audited Combined FinancialStatements or the Audited Unconsolidated Financial Statements, but was taken either from theUnaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements or our accounting records orinternal management reporting systems or has been calculated based on figures from the above-mentioned sources.
75
Due to the adoption of IFRS 16 – “Leases” for the fiscal year beginning as of October 1, 2019, by
applying the modified retrospective approach, the financial information presented in theProspectus for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 is not fully comparable to thefinancial information for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 and for the fiscal yearsended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (see “ 9.5 Key Factors Affecting Comparability ”).
4.7.2 Note on Currency

participating member states in the third stage of the European Economic Union pursuant to theTreaty Establishing the European Community. The amounts in “ $”, “U.S. dollar ”o r“ USD” refer
to the legal currency of the United States of America (“ United States ”, “USA”o r“ U.S.”).
Fluctuations in the currency exchange rates between the euro and the U.S. dollar or othercurrencies will affect the U.S. dollar or other currency amounts received by owners of the Shareson conversion of dividends, if any, paid in euro on the Shares. The Group’s principal functionalcurrency is the euro, and the Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in euro.
4.7.3 Note Regarding Figures and Technical Terms
Financial information presented in parentheses or preceded by a “minus” sign in the Prospectus

Unless otherwiseindicated, all financial data presented in the text and tables in this section of this Prospectus isshown in millions of euros ( €million), commercially rounded to the nearest million. Percentage
changes and ratios in the text and tables of the Prospectus are calculated based on theunderlying numbers as presented in this Prospectus, i.e., after rounding of such underlying
numbers, and then commercially rounded to a whole percentage or to one digit after thedecimal point. In some instances, such rounded figures and percentages may not add up to 100%or to the totals or subtotals contained in the Prospectus. Furthermore, totals and subtotals intables may differ slightly from unrounded figures contained in the Prospectus due to rounding inaccordance with commercial rounding. A dash (“—”) signifies that the relevant figure is notavailable or equal to zero, while a zero (“0”) or nil signifies that the relevant figure has beenrounded to zero.
A glossary of certain technical and financial terms and abbreviations used in the Prospectus is
provided at the end of the Prospectus under the heading “ 23 Glossary ”.
4.7.4 Certain Definitions
Certain individual line items in the Combined Statements of Income of Siemens Energy prepared
in accordance with IFRS are described under “ 9.6 Definition and Discussion of Certain Financial
Measures ”. In addition, in this Prospectus, we use certain financial information neither defined
under IFRS nor, in Siemens Energy’s view, qualifying as alternative performance measures (see“4.8 Alternative Performance Measures ”):
Where we refer to “ Orders ” we use the following definition: Orders are determined principally
as estimated revenue of accepted purchase orders for which enforceable rights and obligationsexist as well as subsequent order value changes and adjustments, excluding letters of intent. Todetermine Orders, Siemens Energy considers termination rights and customer’s creditworthiness.We present Orders on Group, reportable segment and division level. Orders are also presentedfor our service business and new unit business (calculated as Orders less Orders from servicebusiness).
We disclose total revenue for our service business and our new unit business (calculated as total
revenue less total revenue from service business) on Group, reportable segment and divisionlevel.
We refer to “ Book-to-Bill Ratio ” as the ratio of Orders to revenue, regarded as an economic
indicator for overall trends in Siemens Energy’s markets and Siemens Energy’s ability to
76
sustainably generate business with customers (see also “ 9.4.4 High Revenue Visibility From Order
Backlog ”). We define Book-to-Bill Ratio as the ratio of Orders to total revenue for a specified
period, generally a quarter, a year-to-date period or a fiscal year. Book-to-Bill Ratio is presentedon Group, reportable segment and division level, and for our new unit business and servicebusiness.
We disclose “ Order Backlog ” in order to provide information about the remaining performance
obligations in our existing contracts. Order Backlog is calculated by adding the Orders of thecurrent reporting period to the balance of the Order Backlog as of the end of the prior reportingperiod and then subtracting the revenue recognized in the current reporting period.Furthermore, direct order value adjustments such as modifications or cancellations of orders,currency translation and portfolio effects are taken into account. We determine Order Backlogon Group, reportable segment and division level. We also present Order Backlog based on Ordersand revenue from our service business and new unit business (calculated as Order Backlog lessOrder Backlog from service business).
We define “ Backlog-to-Revenue Ratio ” as the ratio of Order Backlog as of the end of a fiscal year
to total revenue for that fiscal year. Backlog-to-Revenue Ratio is presented on Group andreportable segment level, and for our new unit business and service business.
We disclose the “ Order Backlog Reach ” for the following fiscal year, in order to inform about the
amount and timing of revenue that we expect to recognize from the remaining performanceobligations in our existing contracts. Order Backlog Reach is determined by Siemens Energy inthree time intervals: within the current fiscal year, within the following fiscal year and after thefollowing fiscal year. We present Order Backlog Reach on Group and on reportable segmentlevel.
We define “ Revenue Growth Rate ” as the percentage change year-over-year which is calculated
by dividing the absolute revenue difference between a base year and the previous period by theprevious period revenue.
We use “ Special Items ” when we refer to the following items:
Restructuring and integration costs – Restructuring costs refer to personnel measures leading
to severance charges, in the past mainly related to the Gas and Power segment. Integrationcosts refer to the SGRE segment only and are related mainly to the merger of Gamesa andSiemens Wind Power into SGRE S.A. and, to a lesser extent, to the acquisition of assets fromSenvion.
Stand-alone costs – Stand-alone costs relate to the preparation of our separation from
Siemens Group and the formation of Siemens Energy as an independent enterprise. Theyrelate to the Carve-Out and Spin-Off of Siemens Energy and include, amongst others, costsfor information technology (“ IT”) applications, external service providers, costs related to the
listing, and personnel related costs. For future reporting periods, especially personnel-relatedcosts will be incurred for retention and accelerated vesting of share-based compensation.
Strategic portfolio decisions – Major asset impairments and write-downs related to Siemens
Energy Group strategic portfolio decisions. For example, such strategic portfolio decisionsincluded in the past our strategic portfolio decision to streamline our offering of aero-derivative gas turbines. While we will continue to service all types of our aero-derivative gasturbines and still deliver all aero-derivative gas turbines that have already been ordered, wewill over time no longer actively market our larger sized aero-derivative gas turbines. Formore information, see 12.3.3.1.2(2) Aero-Derivative Gas Turbines .
In the opinion of Siemens Energy’s management, these Special Items affect Adjusted EBITA on a
recurring or non-recurring basis. These Special Items are not a recognized term under IFRS.Special Items are subject to certain discretion in the allocation of various income and expensesand the application of discretion may differ from company to company. Special Items also includeexpenses that will recur in future accounting periods. Specifically, we expect further significantpersonnel-related restructuring costs and to a limited extent stand-alone costs in the coming
77
fiscal years. For a break-down of Special Items incurred in the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, as
well as in the nine-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, see “ 9.4.10.3 Special Items ”.
Geographically, we divide our business into three reporting regions – Europe, Commonwealth of
Independent States, the Middle East and Africa (“ EMEA ”), Canada, the United States as well as
Middle and South America (the “ Americas ”) and the other countries of the Asian continent as
well as Australia and New Zealand (“ Asia, Australia ”). When we discuss Orders and revenue for
our reporting regions in this Prospectus, Orders and revenue are measured by location ofcustomers.
4.8 Alternative Performance Measures
In accordance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/301 and the EuropeanSecurities and Markets Authority (“ ESMA ”) Guidelines on alternative performance measures
(“APMs ”) of October 5, 2015 (the “ ESMA Guidelines ”), the following sections set out information
related to certain financial measures of the Siemens Energy Group that are not defined by IFRSand which the Group regards as APMs within the meaning of the ESMA Guidelines.
4.8.1 Definitions
APM Definition Relevance of its Use
Adjusted earnings
before interest, taxesand amortization(“Adjusted EBITA ”)Adjusted EBITA is presented on Group,
reportable segment and division level.
From April 1, 2020, Adjusted EBITA is
calculated as earnings before financinginterest, income taxes, amortization expensesrelated to intangible assets acquired inbusiness combinations and goodwillimpairments. Financing interest excluded fromAdjusted EBITA is any interest income orexpense other than financial result fromoperations ( i.e., interest income related to
receivables from customers, from cashallocated to the segments and interestexpenses on payables to suppliers).
Prior to April 1, 2020, essential pension-related
items with a financing character had beenexcluded from the definition of AdjustedEBITA on reportable segment level butincluded on Group level. Goodwill impairmentswere included on both Group and segmentlevel, as further described and presented in thesegment reporting of the Audited CombinedFinancial Statements.
The segment reporting of the Unaudited
Condensed Combined Interim FinancialStatements contains Adjusted EBITA forSiemens Energy as well as the Gas and Powersegment and the SGRE segment for the fiscalyears 2019, 2018 and 2017 calculated byretrospectively applying the definition validfrom April 1, 2020.We disclose Adjusted EBITA as APM, as we
believe it is a meaningful measure to evaluatethe performance of our business activities overtime. We understand that this measure isbroadly used by analysts, rating agencies andinvestors in assessing our performance.Adjusted EBITA is used by Siemens Energymanagement as a financial measure to assessthe operating performance of our Group,reportable segments and division.
Financing interest, income taxes, amortization
expenses of intangible assets acquired inbusiness combinations as well as goodwillimpairments are excluded as managementdoes not regard them as indicative ofoperational performance. Costs for supportfunctions are primarily allocated to thereportable segments. Prior to April 1, 2020,Siemens Energy excluded pension relatedinterest in the definition of Adjusted EBITA onthe level of reportable segments becausedecisions on essential pension-related itemswith a financing character are made centrally.Accordingly, Adjusted EBITA on the level ofreportable segments only included amountsnot related to the financing character ofpensions, such as service cost of pension plans.Siemens Energy believes that the exclusion ofpension-related interest from the definition ofAdjusted EBITA also on the Group level fromApril 1, 2020 provides investors with moremeaningful information with regard to theperformance of the operating business ofSiemens Energy.
Goodwill impairments are excluded from the
definition of Adjusted EBITA, since SiemensEnergy considers such items as not to beindicative for the operative performance of itsbusiness activities and therefore believes thatthe exclusion provides more meaningfulinformation to assess its operativeperformance.
78
APM Definition Relevance of its Use
Adjusted EBITA
margin (“ Adjusted
EBITA Margin ”)Adjusted EBITA Margin is calculated by
dividing Adjusted EBITA by total revenue.
Adjusted EBITA Margin is presented on the
Group and reportable segment level.We believe that the presentation of Adjusted
EBITA Margins provides useful information onhow our business developed in our marketsand enhances the ability of our investors tocompare profitability across our segments.
Adjusted earnings
before interest, taxesand amortizationbefore special items(“Adjusted EBITA
before SpecialItems ”)Adjusted EBITA before Special Items is
calculated as the respective Adjusted EBITA onGroup and segment level before Special Items.Special Items are restructuring and integrationcosts, stand-alone costs and strategic portfoliodecisions (see “ 4.7.4 Certain Definitions ” and
“9.4.10.3 Special Items ”).
Adjusted EBITA before Special Items is
presented on Group, reportable segment anddivision level.We disclose Adjusted EBITA before Special
Items as an APM, as we believe it is ameaningful measure to evaluate theperformance of our business activities overtime, without being affected by Special Items(as defined by Siemens Energy), correspondingto a normalized result of operations.
Adjusted EBITA
margin beforespecial items(“Adjusted EBITA
Margin beforeSpecial Items ”)Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items is
calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITA beforeSpecial Items by total revenue.
Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items is
presented on the Group, reportable segmentand division level.We believe that the presentation of Adjusted
EBITA Margin before Special Items providesuseful information on how our businessdeveloped in our markets under a normalizedperspective.
Earnings before
interest, taxes,depreciation andamortization(“EBITDA ”)We define EBITDA as income (loss) before
financial result ( i.e., interest income, interest
expense and other financial income (expense),net), income taxes and depreciation/amortization and impairments of goodwill,other intangible assets and property, plant andequipment, net of reversals of impairments aspresented in our Combined FinancialStatements).
EBITDA is presented on the Group level.We disclose EBITDA as an APM, as we believe it
is a meaningful measure to evaluate theperformance of our business activities overtime. We understand that this measure isbroadly used by analysts, rating agencies andinvestors in assessing our performance. EBITDAis used to calculate the Adjusted Net Debt toEBITDA Ratio.
Net cash or net debt
(“(Net Cash) / Net
Debt ”) and adjusted
net cash or net debt(“Adjusted (Net
Cash) / Net Debt ”)We define (Net Cash) / Net Debt as total debt
less total liquidity. Total debt is defined asshort-term debt and current maturities oflong-term debt plus long-term debt pluspayables to Siemens Group from financingactivities. Total liquidity is defined as cash andcash equivalents plus receivables from SiemensGroup from financing activities. Adjusted (NetCash) / Net Debt represents (Net Cash) / NetDebt plus provisions for pensions and similarobligations. A negative value represents a NetCash position.
(Net Cash) / Net Debt and Adjusted (Net Cash) /
Net Debt are presented on the Group level.We believe that the presentation of Net Debt
and Adjusted Net Debt provides usefulinformation to investors because ourmanagement reviews both measures as part ofits management of our liquidity, financialflexibility, capital structure and leverage.Furthermore, we understand that certainrating agencies, creditors and credit analystsmay monitor our Net Debt and Adjusted NetDebt as part of their assessment of ourbusiness.
Adjusted (Net Cash) /
Net Debt to EBITDAratio (“ Adjusted
(Net Cash) / Net
Debt to EBITDARatio ”)Adjusted (Net Cash) / Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio
is calculated by dividing Adjusted (Net Cash) /Net Debt by EBITDA.
For purposes of calculating the Adjusted (Net
Cash) / Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, EBITDA forthe last twelve months is used, which iscalculated as EBITDA for the nine-monthperiod ended June 30, 2020 plus EBITDA forthe fiscal year 2019 less EBITDA for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019.
Adjusted (Net Cash) / Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio
is presented on the Group level.This ratio is a measure used by our
management to review our liquidity, financialflexibility, capital structure and leverage tomaintain ready access to capital markets andto sustain our ability to repay and service ourfinancial obligations over time. The ratioindicates the approximate number of yearsthat would be needed to cover the Adjusted(Net Cash) / Net Debt through income fromcontinuing operations, without taking intoaccount interest, taxes, depreciation andamortization. Therefore, we believe that thisinformation provides useful information toinvestors. Furthermore, we understand thatcertain rating agencies, creditors and creditanalysts may monitor such a ratio.
79
APM Definition Relevance of its Use
Free cash flow (“ Free
Cash Flow ”)Free Cash Flow is presented on the reportable
segment and Group level. On the reportablesegment level, Free Cash Flow constitutes cashflows from operating activities less additions tointangible assets and property, plant andequipment. It excludes financing interest,except for cases where interest on qualifyingassets is capitalized or classified as contractcosts; it also excludes income taxes as well ascertain other payments and proceeds. OnGroup level, Free Cash Flow can be calculatedas difference of the line items cash flows fromoperating activities and additions to intangibleassets and property, plant and equipment inthe Combined Statements of Cash Flows.We believe that the presentation of Free Cash
Flow provides meaningful information toinvestors because it is a measure of cashgenerated by our operations after deductingcash outflows for additions to intangible assetsand property, plant and equipment. Therefore,the measure gives an indication of the long-termcash generating ability of our business. Inaddition, because Free Cash Flow is not impactedby portfolio activities (the line item acquisitionsof businesses, net of cash acquired is not takeninto consideration), it is less volatile than thetotal of cash flows from operating activities andcash flows from investing activities. For thisreason, Free Cash Flow is reported to ourmanagement on a regular basis.
Cash conversion rate
(“Cash Conversion
Rate ”)Cash Conversion Rate is defined as Free Cash
Flow divided by Adjusted EBITA on SiemensEnergy Group level.We disclose the Cash Conversion Rate as an
APM, as we believe it is a meaningful measureto assess our ability to generate cash, andultimately to pay dividends. Our managementconsiders the Cash Conversion Rate in itsmanagement of our reportable segments, butin particular on Group level. For this reason,we believe that investors’ ability to assess ourability to generate cash flows may beimproved by disclosure of this information.
4.8.2 Overview and Reconciliation
The following sections provide an overview of the APMs defined above and presented by
Siemens Energy on the Group, the reportable segment and/or division level as well asreconciliations to Siemens Energy’s Combined Financial Statements. Siemens Energy presentsthese APMs as (i) supplemental information for the specific reasons outlined above with respectto each APM, (ii) measures of operating performance or as an auxiliary control profitabilityparameter used by its management, including in presentations to the members of the Company’sExecutive Board, and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting, and (iii) they representmeasures that the Group believes are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts andother parties as supplemental measures of operating and financial performance. These APMs mayenhance management’s and investors’ understanding of the Company’s financial performance byexcluding items that are not classified as part of the Company’s ongoing operations, such asinterest payments on loans and income and non-cash expenses.
For example, Siemens Energy considers Adjusted EBITA to be widely used by investors to measure
the Company’s operating performance.
However, these APMs are not defined by IFRS or any other internationally accepted accounting
principles, and such items should not be considered as an alternative to the historical financialresults or other indicators of Siemens Energy’s results of operations and financial position basedon IFRS measures. In particular, they should not be considered as alternatives to the Group’s netincome/loss as an indicator of the Group’s performance and profitability, or as alternatives tocash flows from operating activities as an indicator of its financial strength. The APMs, as definedby Siemens Energy, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by othercompanies due to differences in the way Siemens Energy’s APMs are calculated. Even though theAPMs are used by management to assess ongoing operating performance and indebtedness, andthough these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they have important limitationsas analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis ofSiemens Energy’s results, cash flows or assets and liabilities as reported under IFRS.

88
5.2 The Carve-Out and the Capital Increases Against Contribution in Kind
Prior to the Carve-Out, Siemens Energy Group’s business essentially corresponded to the business
which Siemens reported as its segments “Gas and Power” and “Siemens Gamesa RenewableEnergy” for the three-month period ended 31 December 2019. The aim of the Carve-Out was,subject to certain exceptions, to separate Siemens Energy’s Group’s business (including thematerial assets and liabilities and employees attributed to these segments) from the otheroperations assets, liabilities and employees of Siemens Group and to have it held by a separatesub-group with the ultimate parent SE Global GmbH & Co. KG. For illustration purposes only, theCarve-Out can be summarized by splitting it into two main parts: The transfer of the Gas andPower operations in Germany (“ Germany Carve-Out ”) and in the rest of the world (“ Rest of
World Carve-Out ”). As of the date of the Prospectus, essentially all transfers to SE Global
GmbH & Co. KG have been completed while certain follow-up measures may be necessary, suchas the registration of branches, to make the local business fully operational.
After the Carve-Out but prior to Spin-Off Completion, Siemens transferred limited partnership
interests ( Kommanditanteil ) representing 45% of the total fixed capital ( Festkapital ) in SE Global
GmbH & Co. KG and a corresponding percentage of its direct and indirect shareholding in SEGlobal GmbH & Co. KG’s sole general partner to the Company (see “ 5.2.3 The Capital Increases
Against Contribution in Kind ”) against issuance of the Existing Shares.
5.2.1 Germany Carve-Out
Pursuant to a contribution agreement entered into between Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH &
Co. KG (for more details see “ 18.1.1.1.1(8) German Contribution Agreement ”) on December 20,
2019, Siemens AG transferred to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG domestic and foreign assets, includingmovable assets, intellectual property (“ IP”), lease agreements, legal entities, employees and
contracts, liabilities and other transferable rights and obligations directly held by Siemens AGand attributable to Siemens’ “Gas and Power” business as well as a shareholding ofapproximately 30% in SGRE S.A. and certain newly created central departments for SiemensEnergy. The transfers became effective on January 1, 2020. However, the actual legal transfer ofcertain rights, title in assets and contracts may be subject to the prior completion of registrationprocesses and/or the receipt of third-party consents. In most of these cases, the GermanContribution Agreement provides for an economic transfer of such rights, title in assets, contractsand the like, i.e., the parties of the German Contribution Agreement agreed in most of the cases
to put each other into the same economic position as if the legal transfer had occurred. Asconsideration for this contribution, the interest of Siemens AG in the fixed capital ( Festkapital )o f
SE Global GmbH & Co. KG was increased.
After completion of the Germany Carve-Out, approximately 29% of the shares in SGRE S.A.,
initially held by Siemens’ subsidiary Siemens Beteiligungen Inland GmbH (“ SBI GmbH ”), were
contributed to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, raising its shareholding in SGRE S.A. to approximately59%.
5.2.2 Rest of World Carve-Out
In most other countries in which the respective local Siemens Energy business was, prior to the
Carve-Out, not conducted in a separate legal entity, the relevant local Siemens Energy businesswas separated from the other Siemens business in general before March 31, 2020 (the “ Local
Carve-Outs ”). The separations were largely implemented through the formation of new local
legal entities, or, acquisitions of empty shell companies, into which the local Siemens Energybusiness was transferred either through corporate or transformation law measures under locallaw ( e.g., through spin-offs) or based on purchase or contribution agreements. In some countries,
the local Siemens Energy business was transferred into an already existing local legal entity thatwas attributed to the future Siemens Energy Group. In a limited number of countries, theseparation was implemented by means of a reverse carve-out. In such cases, the existing Siemensbusiness was carved out of local Siemens Group entities into newly formed Siemens Groupentities, with the Siemens Energy business remaining in the existing local Siemens Group entity.
89
Although the respective agreements for the Local Carve-Outs were in general entered into
before March 31, 2020, the actual legal transfer of certain rights, title in assets and contracts ispending the completion of registration processes and/or the receipt of third-party consents insome countries. To the extent legally permissible, the respective agreements for the Local Carve-Outs provide in general for an economic transfer of such rights, title in assets, contracts and thelike, i.e., the parties of such Local Carve-Out agreements agreed in principle to put each other
into the same economic position as if the legal transfer had already occurred in the periodbetween the date on which the transfer of the respective right, title in asset and contract shouldhave occurred and the date on which the transfer actually occurred.
To a certain extent our business is operated through branches, representation offices or
permanent establishments of a local energy business in another country. New branches,representation offices or permanent establishments may have to be registered to make the localbusiness fully operational. In a few countries, including Iraq, Taiwan and the United ArabicEmirates, the registration is pending completion for various reasons, such as local lockdowns dueto COVID-19, newly enacted local legal requirements or lengthy local registration procedures.The respective agreements for the Local Carve-Outs provide in principle for an economic transferof affected rights, title in assets, contracts, liabilities and the like, i.e., the parties of such Local
Carve-Out agreements agreed to put each other into the same economic position as if the legaltransfer had already occurred in the period between the date on which the transfer of therespective right, title in asset, contract and liability should have occurred and the date on whichthe transfer actually occurred. With regard to new projects, i.e., agreements that are to be
entered into after the date on which the respective local Carve-Out should have occurred,Siemens and Siemens Energy agreed on a defined process under which on a case-by-case basisSiemens and Siemens Energy will evaluate whether a workaround, such as project execution bythe respective local Siemens entity for the benefit of Siemens Energy against a respectiveconsideration, will be feasible.
In a second step, the shares in the local Siemens Energy entities, which, following the execution
of the separations, are aimed to exclusively hold the respective local Siemens Energy business,were, to the extent such shares were not already held by Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V. orany of its subsidiaries, generally transferred to Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V. In othercases, certain local Siemens Energy businesses, especially the local Siemens Energy business in theU.S., were not separated by way of a Local Carve-Out and transferred to Siemens Gas and PowerHolding B.V.; instead, shares in the already existing local Siemens Energy entities were directlycontributed or transferred to Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V. or SE Global GmbH & Co. KG.In Bangladesh, the reverse carve-out transfer is still pending and expected to become effective inDecember 2020, due to lengthy local registration procedures. In a few countries, including,Kuwait, Ghana, Egypt and United Arab Emirates, the local registration procedures for givingeffect to the share transfers have not been completed yet. In these countries the local sharetransfer agreements provide that the respective share sellers and the respective share purchasersshall, from the respective date on which the agreement for the transfer of shares becameeffective until the date on which the title in the shares has been legally transferred, put eachother into the same economic position as if the legal transfer had occurred.
Furthermore, in some countries, no Local Carve-Outs took place. Instead, Siemens and Siemens
Energy have concluded agency agreements under which Siemens Group entities carry outSiemens Energy businesses for Siemens Energy (see “ 18.1.1.1.1(5) Agreements with regard to
Siemens Energy’s Gas and Power Business in Algeria, Greece, Indonesia and Pakistan ” and
“18.1.1.1.1(6) Agreements Related to the Conduct of Siemens Energy’s Gas and Power Business in
India ”). For risks related to carve-out measures, see “ 3.5 Risks Related to Our Separation from the
Siemens Group ”.
For joint ventures relating to the Siemens Energy business, Siemens has obtained consents from
the joint venture partners for the purchase by or transfer of joint venture participations toSiemens Energy with certain exceptions, most notably including the joint venture ShanghaiElectric Power Generation Equipment Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China (the “ Shanghai Electric JV ”).
90
Siemens holds a participation of 40% in the Shanghai Electric JV and has agreed with Siemens
Energy that Siemens Energy shall acquire this participation following Spin-Off Completion,subject to the consent of the joint venture partner. Upon a request to grant its consent, Siemens’joint venture partner has a pre-emption purchase right, which could be exercised. The purchaseprice to be paid by Siemens Energy for the participation in the Shanghai Electric JV will bedetermined by an external valuation firm. The expected purchase price for the participation wascontributed in advance to the Group in cash. Should the actual purchase price as determined bythe external valuation firm differ from the expected purchase price, Siemens Energy will need topay to Siemens the respective difference and vice versa. Should the joint venture partner exerciseits pre-emption purchase right, the Group would retain the contribution already made bySiemens up to the amount of the purchase price to be paid by the joint venture partner. Thepurchase price itself would accrue to Siemens for local legal reasons.
Pursuant to a contribution agreement entered into between Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH &
Co. KG on March 30, 2020, Siemens AG transferred to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG with effect as ofMarch 31, 2020 (i) its shares in Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V., holding most of the sharesin Siemens Energy’s global operations, (ii) its shares in Siemens Energy Inc., holding the shares inSiemens Energy’s US operations, (iii) its shares in Siemens Gas and Power S.A. and (iv) itsmeanwhile acquired, approximately 8.1%, shares in SGRE S.A. Further, Siemens contributedapproximately €6.2 billion via clearing accounts to capitalize Siemens Energy. Subsequently,
Siemens provided another approximately €0.1 billion in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in
approximately €6.4 billion as of June 30, 2020, that were provided to Siemens Energy. This
figure includes approximately €3 billion to satisfy the purchase price obligations of Siemens
Energy for asset transfers by Siemens that were not carved out until March 31, 2020. Asconsideration for this contribution, Siemens AG’s partnership interest ( Kommanditanteil )i nS E
Global GmbH & Co. KG was increased.
Thereafter, until the Capital Increases Against Contribution in Kind, Siemens and SBI GmbH held
partnership interests ( Kommanditanteile ) representing 87.98% and 12.02% of the total fixed
capital ( Festkapital ) of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, respectively, and corresponding share
percentages in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG’s sole general partner SEM GmbH.
5.2.3 The Capital Increases Against Contribution in Kind
Pursuant to a contribution agreement dated May 22, 2020 entered into between Siemens AG and
SBI GmbH on the one side and the Company on the other side, (i) Siemens AG committed totransfer to the Company a fraction of its partnership interest ( Teil-Kommanditanteil ) in SE Global
GmbH & Co. KG, representing 32.98% of the total fixed capital ( Festkapital ) of SE Global GmbH &
Co. KG, and shares in SEM GmbH, the sole general partner of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG,representing 32.98% of its share capital, and (ii) SBI GmbH committed to transfer to theCompany its entire partnership interest ( Kommanditanteil ) in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG,
representing 12.02% of the total fixed capital ( Festkapital ) of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, and all
of its shares in SEM GmbH, the sole general partner of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, representing12.02% of its share capital. As consideration for these contributions, Siemens AG received239,582,401 new shares in the Company (the “ Siemens New SE Shares ”), thereby increasing the
number of shares in the Company held by Siemens AG to 239,682,401 (the “ Siemens SE Shares ”),
and SBI GmbH received 87,307,936 new shares in the Company (the “ SBI SE Shares ”).
In order to create the Siemens New SE Shares and the SBI SE Shares, the Company’s then sole
shareholder Siemens AG in an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting on May 22, 2020 resolved toincrease the Company’s share capital from €100,000 by €326,890,337 to €326,990,337 by
issuing 326,890,337 shares against contribution of the above-mentioned partnership interests(Kommanditanteile ) of Siemens AG and SBI GmbH in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG and shares in SEM
GmbH. Upon registration of these capital increases in the Company’s commercial register onSeptember 1, 2020, the SBI SE Shares and the Siemens New SE Shares were created.

5.3 The Spin-Off
The aim of the Spin-Off is to complete the contribution of Siemens’ remaining partnership
interest ( Kommanditanteil ) in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, representing 55% of its total fixed
capital ( Festkapital ), and Siemens’ remaining shares in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG’s sole general
partner SEM GmbH, representing 55% of its share capital, to the Company against transfer of theNew Shares, representing 55% of the Shares, to the shareholders of Siemens AG.
5.3.1 Spin-Off Procedure
On May 22, 2020, the Company and Siemens AG entered into the Spin-Off and Transfer
Agreement. The effectiveness of this agreement was, inter alia , subject to the approval by a 75%
majority of the Company’s and Siemens AG’s general shareholders’ meetings. These approvalswere obtained on May 22 and July 9, 2020 respectively. Pursuant to the Spin-Off and TransferAgreement, Siemens committed to transfer the partnership interest ( Kommanditanteil )i t
currently holds in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG (representing 55% of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG’stotal fixed capital ( Festkapital )) and the shares it currently holds in its sole general partner, SEM
GmbH (representing 55% of the share capital of SEM GmbH) to Siemens Energy AG by way of aspin-off for absorption ( Abspaltung zur Aufnahme ). In return, the shareholders of Siemens AG
shall receive the New Shares created by way of the Spin-Off Capital Increase which will represent55% of the Shares following completion of the Spin-Off. The Spin-Off and Transfer Agreementprovides for an allotment ratio ( Zuteilungsverhältnis ) of 2:1, i.e., each shareholder of Siemens AG
is entitled to receive one share in the Company for every two shares it holds in Siemens AG. Thetransfer of the assets to be spun off shall occur with economic effect as of April 1, 2020, 0:00hours. After this time, all acts taken by Siemens AG in relation to the assets to be spun-off shallbe deemed to have been performed for the account of the Company. The Spin-Off Completion isexpected to occur on September 25, 2020 upon the registrations of the Spin-Off with Siemens
92
AG’s commercial registers in Munich and Berlin-Charlottenburg whereby the later registration is
determinative. With respect to the reasons for the Spin-Off, see “ 6 Reasons for the Spin-Off and
Listing and Costs of Spin-Off and Listing ”.
5.3.2 Spin-Off Auditor
Pursuant to a resolution of the regional court ( Landgericht ) Munich I dated January 22, 2020,
Baker Tilly GmbH & Co. KG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Düsseldorf (“ Baker Tilly ”), was
appointed as the spin-off auditor. The Spin-Off and Transfer Agreement was audited by BakerTilly as spin-off auditor, and a spin-off audit report was issued.
5.3.3 Spin-Off Capital Increase and Post-Formation Audit
As provided for in the Spin-Off and Transfer Agreement, the Company’s then sole shareholder
Siemens AG held an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting on May 22, 2020 where it was resolvedto increase the Company’s share capital from €326,990,337 by €399,654,856 to €726,645,193

in SEM GmbH. The Spin-Off Capital Increase was registered in the Company’s commercial registeron September 1, 2020 and will become effective with registration of the Spin-Off in thecommercial registers of Siemens AG, expected to occur on September 25, 2020.
As the Company was created by transforming Kyros 52 GmbH, which had been inactive and was
reactivated less than two years prior to the conclusion of the Spin-Off and Transfer Agreement,so-called post-formation audits have been carried out. In this regard, the Supervisory Board hasreviewed the Spin-Off and Transfer Agreement as well as the contribution agreement pursuantto which the Capital Increases Against Contribution in Kind have been implemented andprepared in each case a post-formation report dated May 22, 2020.

(Wertpapierkennnummer ) ENER6Y –
On May 22, 2020, Siemens AG as the transferring company (transferor) and Siemens Energy AG as
the transferee company entered into a spin-off and transfer agreement ( Abspaltungs- und
Übernahmevertrag ). Accordingly, Siemens AG transferred a partnership interest in Siemens Gas
and Power GmbH & Co. KG (representing 55.0% of Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG’sfixed capital ( Festkapital )) and a corresponding stake in Siemens Gas and Power Management
GmbH, the general partner of Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG (representing 55.0% ofthe share capital of Siemens Gas and Power Management GmbH) to Siemens Energy AG as
94
transferee (the remaining 45.0% of the respective holdings in Siemens Gas and Power GmbH &
Co. KG and in Siemens Gas and Power Management GmbH were already transferred to SiemensEnergy AG), by way of a spin-off for assumption pursuant to Section 123(2) no. 1 of the GermanTransformation Act ( Umwandlungsgesetz ) to Siemens Energy AG. As consideration, Siemens
Energy AG grants to the shareholders of Siemens AG, free of charge, new shares in SiemensEnergy AG. An allotment ratio of 2:1 has been stipulated in the spin-off and transfer agreement,i.e., for every two (2) shares of Siemens AG, one (1) Share of Siemens Energy AG will be issued.
The shareholders’ meetings of Siemens Energy AG and Siemens AG approved the spin-off and
transfer agreement on May 22, 2020 and on July 9, 2020, respectively. The Spin-Off was firstregistered with the commercial register of Siemens Energy AG at the local court ( Amtsgericht )o f
Munich and subsequently with the commercial register of Siemens AG at the local courts ofMunich and Berlin-Charlottenburg, and became effective accordingly. Upon effectiveness of theSpin-Off, 55.0% of the Siemens Energy AG shares are now held by the shareholders of SiemensAG, while Siemens and Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. hold directly and/or indirectly 35.1% and9.9%, respectively, of the Shares.
For the completion of the Spin-Off, Siemens Energy AG increased its share capital from
€326,990,337 by €399,654,856 to €726,645,193 through the issuance of 399,654,856 no-par
value registered shares each representing a notional value of the share capital of €1. These new
shares will be granted to the shareholders of Siemens AG. All shares issued by Siemens Energy AGwill be entitled to dividends as from October 1, 2019.
Allotment Ratio
Upon effectiveness of the Spin-Off, the shareholders of Siemens AG have also become
shareholders of Siemens Energy AG in the proportion of their shareholdings in Siemens AG. Inthis context, Section 10.1 of the spin-off and transfer agreement provides for an allotment ratioof 2:1. This means that each shareholder of Siemens AG receives
 for every two (2) no-par value registered shares of Siemens AG (ISIN DE0007236101 / German
Securities Identification Number (WKN) 723 610)
 one (1) no-par value registered Share of Siemens Energy AG (ISIN DE000ENER6Y0 / WKN
ENER6Y) representing a notional amount of the share capital of €1 and granting dividend
rights as from October 1, 2019.
Trustee
As regards the settlement of the allotment of the new shares in Siemens Energy AG, Deutsche
Bank Aktiengesellschaft acts as trustee for the shareholders of Siemens AG pursuant to Sections125 sentence 1, 71(1) sentence 1 of the German Transformation Act.
Allotment Procedure
As all shares in Siemens AG are held in collective safe custody accounts, the shareholders of
Siemens AG do not need to take any action – except in the event of settlement of fractionalamounts, if any – in relation to the allotment of the shares in Siemens Energy AG. The shares inSiemens Energy AG will be allotted to the shareholders entitled thereto by crediting the shares tothe securities account, which shall in principle occur on September 28, 2020, in accordance withtheir holdings of shares in Siemens AG on (the evening of) September 25, 2020, taking intoaccount any stock exchange transactions still outstanding. It may be expected that, in individualcases, depositary banks will effect, in analogy to the handling at Clearstream Banking AG,Frankfurt am Main (“ CBF”), such crediting only upon settlement of stock exchange transactions
still outstanding, i.e.only on September 30, 2020. The settlement of the above described
measures is centralized at
Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft.
No shares of Siemens Energy AG will be allotted to the holders of American Depositary Receipts
(“ADRs ”) of Siemens AG. Under the provisions of the existing deposit agreement, the shares of
95
Siemens Energy AG attributable to ADRs will be realized for the benefit of the holders of the
ADRs and the realization proceeds will be distributed pro rata after deduction of the costs to the
holders of the ADRs.
As the right of the shareholders of Siemens Energy AG to receive certificates for their shares is
excluded pursuant to the articles of association, the shares of Siemens Energy AG are representedby three global certificates deposited with CBF. The shareholders of Siemens Energy AG hold aninterest in this global holding of shares in accordance with their proportional share as co-owners.
As a result of the allotment ratio, the shareholders of Siemens AG whose holdings of shares in
Siemens AG are not divisible by 2 (two) will receive fractional rights in shares of Siemens EnergyAG (ISIN-Code DE000ENER1T1 // German Securities Identification Number ENER1T), whichgenerally do not confer any shareholder rights. Any consolidation of share fractions to make upfull legal rights ( i.e., settlement of fractions) requires a corresponding purchase or sales order. For
the purpose of the settlement of fractions, the shareholders of Siemens AG are requested to issuetheir relevant depositary bank immediately, if possible,
however, no later than by October 14, 2020,
with a corresponding instruction for the rounding to full legal rights. Deutsche Bank
Aktiengesellschaft as centralized settlement agent is prepared to act as an intermediary for thepurchase and sale of fractional rights to the extent possible. Where no instruction for settlementof fractions is given, the fractional rights attributable to the allotted shares in Siemens Energy AGshall, after the end of October 14, 2020, be combined to form whole shares and disposed of bythe depositary banks and the central settlement agent via the stock exchange. The proceeds fromthis disposition are expected to be disbursed on October 19, 2020 to the respective shareholdersin accordance with the fractional rights attributable to them. It is to be expected that, inindividual cases, depositary banks, especially abroad, will not participate in the settlement offractions or will not accept corresponding instructions.
The allotment of shares in Siemens Energy AG as well as the instruction for settlement of any
fractional rights to shares of Siemens Energy AG resulting therefrom shall be effected at no cost(commissions or out-of-pocket expenses) for the shareholders, provided that the shareholdersmaintain a securities account in Germany.

5.3.6 ADR Program
In the United States, since May 16, 2014, American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) representing

bonus if certain target values for the effects of the Spin-Off or the market value are achievedupon Spin-Off Completion and within the first 120 days after Spin-Off Completion, based on theaverage volume-weighted price of the Shares of the Company (see “ 17.2.3.4 Spin-Off Incentive in
Connection with the Spin-Off “).
As of the date of the Prospectus, all members of the Company’s supervisory board (the
“Supervisory Board ”) are employees of Siemens. Following Spin-Off Completion, Mr. Joe Kaeser
and Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas, who are also serving on the executive board of Siemens AG, andMr. Matthias E. Rebellius, who currently is an employee of Siemens and is expected to become amember of the executive board of Siemens AG with effect as of October 1, 2020, will bemembers of the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, Dr. Andrea Fehrmann, Mr. Jürgen Kerner andMr. Hagen Reimer are expected to remain members of the supervisory board of Siemens AGfollowing Spin-Off Completion.
Siemens AG has an interest in the Spin-Off as it serves to dispose of a majority shareholding in
Siemens Energy. For further details regarding the expectations of Siemens AG and SiemensEnergy AG as to the effects of the Spin-Off, see “ 6 Reasons for the Spin-Off and Listing and Costs
of Spin-Off and Listing ”.

The Listing Agents or their affiliates act as lenders to the Company, primarily under a facility
agreement (see “ 12.9.1 Siemens Energy Facility Agreement ”). Furthermore, the Banks or certain
of their respective affiliates have performed, and are likely to perform in the future, certainadvisory or other services for Siemens Energy or for Siemens AG or certain of their subsidiaries intheir capacity as financial institutions, in particular advisory services in connection with financingtransactions, for which they have received, and are likely to receive in the future, customary feesand expenses.
5.4.6 Information to Distributors
Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment with respect to
the Shares and determining appropriate distribution channels. Solely for the purposes of theproduct governance requirements contained within: (a) Directive 2014/65/EU of May 15, 2014 onmarkets in financial instruments, as amended (“ MiFID II ”); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission
Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures(together, the “ MiFID II Product Governance Requirements ”), and disclaiming all and any
liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any “manufacturers” (for thepurposes of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respectthereto, the Shares have been subject to a product approval process by the Banks. As a result, ithas been determined that such Shares are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retailinvestors and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties,each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels asare permitted by MiFID II (the “ Target Market Assessment ”). Notwithstanding the Target Market
Assessment, any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Shares (a“distributor” for the purpose of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) should notethat: the price of the Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment;the Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in theShares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capitalprotection, who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser)are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficientresources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. The Target Market Assessmentis without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling andtransfer restrictions in relation to any subsequent offering or resale of the Shares and does notconstitute (i) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II or (ii) arecommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, purchase, or take any otheraction whatsoever with respect to, the Shares.
In addition, other restrictions may apply in other jurisdictions in relation to any subsequent
offering, transfer or resale of the Shares. Potential investors or distributors should make theirown assessment on the suitability, appropriateness and lawfulness of any such offering, transferor resale and as to their own investment decision and, if appropriate, seek professional advice forthe relevant jurisdiction or jurisdictions. In particular, it may be unlawful in certain jurisdictions,including Malaysia and the People’s Republic of China, to make Shares available to others,including through a resale, allotment, delivery or transfer, without a registration or thepublication of a disclosure document approved or otherwise endorsed by the competentauthority in such jurisdictions unless an exemption or waiver applies.
In Canada, a resale of the Shares will generally be a “distribution” triggering a prospectus
requirement unless an exemption under the Canadian National Instrument 45-102 on ResaleRestrictions (“ NI 45-102 ”) is available. An exemption under section 2.15 of NI 45-102 provides that
a prospectus requirement does not apply to the first trade of a security distributed under aprospectus exemption if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the issuer is a “foreign issuer”on the distribution date (that is, the issuer is incorporated out-side of Canada and does not haveits head office in Canada, and the majority of the issuer’s “executive officers” or directors do notordinarily reside in Canada); (ii) the issuer is not a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction of Canadaon the distribution date, or is not a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction of Canada on the date of
99
the trade; and (iii) the trade is made through an exchange or market outside of Canada, or to a
person or company outside of Canada.
In Switzerland, the Prospectus is not intended to constitute an offer or solicitation to purchase or
invest in the Shares. The Shares may not be publicly offered, directly or indirectly, in Switzerlandwithin the meaning of the Swiss Financial Services Act (“ FinSA ”) and no application has or will be
made to admit the Shares to trading on any trading venue (exchange or multilateral tradingfacility) in Switzerland. Neither this Prospectus nor any other offering or marketing materialrelating to the Shares constitutes a prospectus pursuant to the FinSA, and neither this Prospectusnor any other offering or marketing material relating to the Shares may be publicly distributedor otherwise made publicly available in Switzerland.
In Singapore, the Prospectus has not been registered as a prospectus with the Monetary
Authority of Singapore. Accordingly, the Prospectus and any other document or material inconnection with the offer or resale, or invitation for subscription or purchase, of the Shares maynot be circulated or distributed, nor may the Shares be offered or sold, or be made the subject ofan invitation for subscription or purchase, whether directly or indirectly, to persons in Singaporeother than (i) pursuant to, and in accordance with, the conditions of an exemption in Section 272or Section 273(c) of the Securities and Futures Act, Chapter 289 of Singapore (the “ SFA”), or
(ii) otherwise pursuant to, and in accordance with the conditions of, any other applicableprovision of the SFA. The Shares are prescribed capital markets products (as defined in theSecurities and Futures (Capital Markets Products) Regulations 2018 of Singapore) and ExcludedInvestment Products (as defined in MAS Notice SFA 04-N12: Notice on the Sale of InvestmentProducts and MAS Notice FAA-N16: Notice on Recommendations on Investment Products ofSingapore).

6 REASONS FOR THE SPIN-OFF AND LISTING AND COSTS
OF SPIN-OFF AND LISTING
6.1 Reasons for the Spin-Off and Listing
As a part of its strategy program, referred to as “Vision 2020+”, Siemens decided to implement
the Spin-Off thereby giving Siemens Energy its independence and entrepreneurial freedom topursue its own strategy, resource allocation, strengthen the focus on its customers, technologies,risks and markets and adapt quicker to the rapidly changing market conditions. In particular,Siemens Energy expects to benefit from the ability to independently decide on the allocation offinancial and other resources to successfully navigate the rapidly changing market conditions.
The Company intends to list its entire share capital on the regulated market ( regulierter Markt )
of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange ( Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse ) and, simultaneously, on the
sub-segment with additional post admission obligations (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt StockExchange ( Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse ) to gain access to the capital markets.
6.2 Costs of Spin-Off and Listing
Neither the Company nor Siemens AG will receive proceeds in connection with the Spin-Off.
In connection with the Listing, Siemens Energy will bear costs of approximately €2.0 million; the
remaining costs associated with the Spin-Off and Listing were assumed by Siemens.
101
7 DIVIDEND POLICY
7.1 General Rules on Allocation of Profits and Dividend Payments
The shareholders’ share of profits is determined based on their respective interests in the
Company’s share capital. In a German stock corporation ( Aktiengesellschaft ), resolutions
concerning the distribution of dividends for a given fiscal year, and the amount thereof, areadopted by the general shareholders’ meeting ( Hauptversammlung ) of the subsequent fiscal year
upon a joint proposal by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. Dividends may only bedistributed from the distributable profit ( Bilanzgewinn ) of the Company. The distributable profit
is calculated based on the Company’s unconsolidated financial statements prepared inaccordance with the accounting principles of the German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch )
and the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ). Accounting principles set forth in the
German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch ) differ from IFRS in material respects.
When determining the distributable profit, the net income (loss) for the year must be adjusted
for profit/loss carry-forwards from the prior fiscal year and release of or allocations to reserves.Certain reserves are required to be set up by law and respective allocations must be deductedwhen calculating the net income (loss) before profit distribution. Certain additional limitationsapply if self-created intangible assets or deferred tax assets have been capitalized or certain planassets that exceed corresponding pension liabilities have been capitalized. The Executive Boardmust prepare the annual financial statements (balance sheet, income statement and notes to thefinancial statements) and the management report for the previous fiscal year by the statutorydeadline, and present these to the Supervisory Board and the auditors immediately afterpreparation. At the same time, the Executive Board must present to the Supervisory Board aproposal for the allocation of the Company’s distributable profit. The Supervisory Board mustreview the annual financial statements, the Executive Board’s management report and theproposal for the allocation of the distributable profit, and report to the general shareholders’meeting in writing on the results. The Supervisory Board must submit its report to the ExecutiveBoard within one month after the documents were received. If the Supervisory Board approvesthe annual financial statements after its review, these are deemed adopted unless the ExecutiveBoard and Supervisory Board resolve to assign adoption of the annual financial statements to thegeneral shareholders’ meeting. If the Executive Board and Supervisory Board choose to allow thegeneral shareholders’ meeting to adopt the annual financial statements, or if the SupervisoryBoard does not approve the annual financial statements, the Executive Board must convene ageneral shareholders’ meeting without delay.
The general shareholders’ meeting’s resolution on the allocation of the distributable profit must
be passed with a simple majority of votes. If the Executive Board and Supervisory Board adoptthe annual financial statements, they can allocate an amount of up to half of the Company’s netincome for the year to other surplus reserves. Additions to the legal reserves and loss carry-forwards must be deducted in advance when calculating the amount of net income for the yearto be allocated to other surplus reserves. Pursuant to Section 20 paragraph 4 of the Articles ofAssociation the general shareholders’ meeting may decide that the distributable profits beappropriated by means of a distribution in kind, instead of, or in addition to, a cash dividend. Inthe resolution on the appropriation of the net profit, the general shareholders’ meeting mayallocate amounts to reserves or carry them forward as profit. Dividends resolved by the generalshareholders’ meeting are due and payable on the third business day ( Geschäftstag ) following
the day of the relevant general shareholders’ meeting, unless a later due date is provided in thedividend resolution, in compliance with the rules of the respective clearing system. Generally,withholding tax is withheld from the dividends paid. For more information on the taxation ofdividends, see “ 19.2 Taxation of Dividends ”.
Dividend payment claims are subject to a three-year standard limitation period. If dividend
payment claims expire, then the Company becomes the beneficiary of the dividends. Detailsconcerning any dividends resolved by the general shareholders’ meeting and the paying agentsnamed by the Company in each case will be published in the Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ).
102
7.2 Dividend Policy
Siemens Energy AG did not pay any dividends in the past. Subject to a statutory minimum
dividend of up to approximately €29 million in case sufficient distributable profit is reported in
the Company’s audited unconsolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2020 prepared inaccordance with the requirements of German commercial law applicable to corporations,Siemens Energy AG will not make a dividend payment for the fiscal year 2020. With respect tothe following fiscal years, the Company intends to propose a dividend whose distribution volumeis 40% to 60% of the Group’s net income attributable to shareholders of Siemens Energy AG asshown in the consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with IFRSof the respective prior fiscal year. For this purpose, this net income may be adjusted forextraordinary non-cash effects. Generally, it is intended to fund the dividend payout fromavailable Free Cash Flow taking into account dividend payments received from SGRE S.A., whichintends to propose a dividend in a distribution volume of no less than 25% of its net income.
However, the Company’s ability to pay dividends in future years will depend on the amount of
distributable profit based on the Company’s audited unconsolidated financial statementsprepared in accordance with the accounting principles of the German Commercial Code(Handelsgesetzbuch ). In this context, it should be noted that the Company will be a holding
company with no material business operations of its own. As a result, it will be dependent on itssubsidiaries in order to generate and transfer the funds required to make dividend payments, ifany. Further, in case the Company has to recognize a significant impairment on its interests in SEGlobal GmbH & Co. KG, its ability to make dividend payments could be limited. Accordingly, noassurance regarding the amounts of future distributable profits, if any, can be provided.Consequently, we can provide no assurance that we will pay dividends in future years.
Due to expected attendance levels, Siemens will likely be able to control the resolutions on the
distribution of dividends as long as it does not significantly reduce its post-Spin-Off shareholdingin the Company.
103
8 CAPITALIZATION AND INDEBTEDNESS
The Company will not receive any proceeds in connection with the Spin-Off or Listing.
Accordingly, there will be no effect on the Company’s capitalization as reflected below.
8.1 Capitalization
The following table sets forth an overview of the capitalization of the Siemens Energy Group asof June 30, 2020, based on the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements orfrom our accounting records or internal management reporting systems:

Statements.
2)‘Current debt’ and ‘non-current debt’ guaranteed or secured by third parties includes local bank financing for subsidiaries ofSE Global GmbH & Co. KG in countries in which the usual financing by Siemens Group before the Spin-Off becoming effectivewas not possible or not appropriate. Siemens guarantees or secures repayment of the liabilities, in case of a security by lettersof support ( Patronatserklärungen ), in which Siemens undertakes towards the financing banks to support the repayment by
providing adequate financial funding to the subsidiaries or direct repayment to the financing banks. In connection with theSpin-Off, such guarantees or letters of support issued by Siemens will be replaced, depending on the individual case, withguarantees or letters of support issued by Siemens Energy.
3)‘Total non-current debt’ is referred to as ‘Total non-current liabilities’ in the Unaudited Condensed Combined InterimFinancial Statements.
4)‘Shareholders’ Equity’ refers to ‘Total equity attributable to Siemens Group’, calculated as ‘Total equity as presented in theCombined Statements of Financial Position of the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements less‘Non-controlling interests’ of €597 million as of June 30, 2020 as presented in the Combined Statements of Changes in Equity
of the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements.
5)Prior to Spin-Off Completion, the Siemens Energy Group was not a legal group for Consolidated Financial Statementsreporting purposes in accordance with IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, in the periods presented. The equity waspresented on the basis of the aggregation of the net assets of the Siemens Energy business under the control of Siemens AGand centrally managed by the managing board of Siemens AG. Consequently, the Unaudited Condensed Combined InterimFinancial Statements do not separately disclose share capital, legal reserves and other reserves.
6)‘Total’ is the sum of ‘Total current debt’, ‘Total non-current debt’ and ‘Shareholders’ Equity’.

9 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF NET
ASSETS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
Investors should read the following discussion and analysis of our net assets, financial position
and results of operations in conjunction with the sections “3 Risk Factors”, “4.4 Forward-LookingStatements”, “4.7 Note Regarding the Presentation of Financial Information”, “4.8 AlternativePerformance Measures” and “12 Business”, the Audited Combined Financial Statements, theUnaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements and the Audited UnconsolidatedFinancial Statements, which are included in this Prospectus. For further information on thefinancial statements, see also pages F-1 et seq.
The Audited Combined Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS and have
been audited in accordance with Section 317 of the German Commercial Code(Handelsgesetzbuch – “ HGB ”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for
Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institutder Wirtschaftsprüfer – “ IDW”), by EY, who issued an unqualified independent auditor’s report
thereon. The Audited Unconsolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with therequirements of German commercial law applicable to business corporations and have beenaudited by EY in accordance with Section 317 HGB and in compliance with German GenerallyAccepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the IDW, who issued anunqualified independent auditor’s report thereon. The Unaudited Condensed Combined InterimFinancial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS on interim financial reporting(IAS 34).
In contrast to the preparation of consolidated financial statements, the preparation of the
combined financial statements requires additional significant Management (as defined below)judgments when determining the respective combination rules, which affect the recognition andamount of assets and liabilities, income and expenses and contingent liabilities. In such cases, theactual results may differ from our assumptions or estimates. In addition, the Combined FinancialStatements include companies that were held by Siemens Group during the relevant reportingperiods. Therefore, the Combined Financial Statements do not claim to represent the net assets,financial position and results of operations or cash flows that would have resulted had theSiemens Energy Group existed in its current form since October 1, 2016, nor can the net assets,financial position and results of operations or cash flows as shown in the above-mentionedfinancial statements be extrapolated for future periods or a future reporting date. See “9.3 Basisof Preparation” below.
Where financial data in the following tables is presented as “audited”, this means that it was
taken from the Audited Combined Financial Statements or the Audited Unconsolidated FinancialStatements. Where financial data is presented in the following tables as “unaudited”, it indicatesthat the financial data has not been taken from the Audited Combined Financial Statements orthe Audited Unconsolidated Financial Statements but has been taken either from the UnauditedCondensed Combined Interim Financial Statements mentioned above or from Siemens Energy’saccounting records or internal management reporting system or has been calculated based onfigures from the above-mentioned sources.
Certain tables in this section also include certain APMs. However, these APMs are not defined by
IFRS or any other internationally accepted accounting principles, and such items should not beconsidered as an alternative to the historical financial results or other indicators of SiemensEnergy’s results of operations and financial position based on IFRS measures. In particular, theyshould not be considered as alternatives to the Group’s net income/loss as an indicator of theGroup’s performance and profitability, or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activitiesas an indicator of its financial strength. The APMs, as defined by Siemens Energy, may not becomparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other companies due to differences inthe way Siemens Energy’s APMs are calculated. Even though the APMs are used by management
106
to assess ongoing operating performance and indebtedness, and though these types of measures
are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations as analytical tools, and youshould not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of Siemens Energy’s results,cash flows or assets and liabilities as reported under IFRS.
Financial information presented in parentheses or preceded by a “minus” sign in the Prospectus
denote a negative amount. Certain numerical data, financial information and market data in theProspectus have been rounded in accordance with commercial rounding. Unless otherwiseindicated, all financial data presented in the text and tables in this section of this Prospectus isshown in millions of euros ( €million), commercially rounded to the nearest million. Percentage
changes and ratios in the text and tables of the Prospectus are calculated based on theunderlying numbers as presented in this Prospectus, i.e., after rounding of such underlyingnumbers, and then commercially rounded to a whole percentage or to one digit after thedecimal point. In some instances, such rounded figures and percentages may not add up to 100%or to the totals or subtotals contained in the Prospectus. Furthermore, totals and subtotals intables may differ slightly from unrounded figures contained in the Prospectus due to rounding inaccordance with commercial rounding. A dash (“—”) signifies that the relevant figure is notavailable or equal to zero, while a zero (“0”) or nil signifies that the relevant figure has beenrounded to zero.

9.2 Segmentation
Siemens Energy is steered by its Executive Board in two reportable segments, Gas and Power andSiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy:
Gas and Power segment – Our Gas and Power segment offers a wide range of products,
solutions and services in the fields of power transmission and conventional central anddistributed power generation alongside industrial applications for the oil and gas industry andfor industrial process applications. The segment further develops and markets newtechnologies in the field of decarbonization. The Gas and Power segment’s operations are splitinto three divisions: Transmission, Generation and Industrial Applications and arecomplemented by its Other Operations:
–Transmission – Our Transmission division offers a broad portfolio of products, systems,
solutions and services geared around the key market trends of digitalization,decarbonization, grid stability and electrification. The product portfolio comprises air- andgas-insulated switchgear, transformers, digitalized products and other products such asbushings. Transmission division offers its products individually or as part of tailor-madesystems and solutions as well as services relating to power transmission of high (whichincludes ultra-, extra- and high-voltage layers) and, to a lesser extent, medium and lowvoltage levels as part of product bundles or solutions.
–Generation – Our Generation division offers a broad portfolio of products, solutions and
services for central and distributed power generation. The product portfolio comprises gasand steam turbines, generators and gas engines as well as instrumentation & controls (“ I&C”)
and electrical systems. Products are sold individually or as part of solutions. A comprehensiveset of services covering performance enhancements, maintenance services, customer trainingand professional consulting complement its products and solutions businesses.
107
–Industrial Applications – Our Industrial Applications division offers a broad portfolio of
products, integrated systems and solutions, comprising rotating equipment, integrated drive-train systems, electrification, automation and digital solutions for the on- and offshoreindustry, marine industry and the fiber industry, and water treatment solutions.

–Other Operations – Our Other Operations include our New Energy Business and certain
at-equity investments. Our New Energy Business complements the portfolio of our Gas andPower segment by developing new technologies in the field of decarbonized energy systems.The current focus of the New Energy Business is to enable the green hydrogen economy andto promote decarbonization, for instance by developing “power-to-x” technologies whichuse electricity from renewable energy sources (also referred to as “ renewables ”) for the
production of low-CO
2synthetic energy sources (power fuels).
Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy – Our Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy segment (also
referred to as ‘SGRE’) focuses on the promotion, design, development, manufacture and supplyof products, installation and technologically advanced services in the renewable energy sectorwith a focus on wind power plants; it also provides services including management, operationand maintenance. SGRE also explores opportunities in adjacent renewable business fieldswhich, in many cases, are also related to the wind turbine business. However, these activitiesrepresent only a small fraction of SGRE’s current business. SGRE S.A.’s shares are listed on theSpanish stock exchanges of Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao and included in theSpanish IBEX 35 index. Siemens Energy holds approximately 67% of the shares in SGRE S.A. TheSGRE segment comprises the business units Onshore Wind Power, Offshore Wind Power andService:
–Onshore Wind Power – With almost 40 years of experience, our business unit Onshore Wind
Power provides innovative wind turbine design, manufacturing and installation solutions forglobal onshore markets mainly focused on geared technology including platforms, which canbe adapted to regional and local needs.

nearly three decades of offshore wind turbine equipment design, manufacturing andinstallation experience focused on direct drive technology.
–Service – Our business unit Service offers a comprehensive and flexible portfolio for the
maintenance and optimization of wind turbines, providing a holistic, lifetime-care. Completeasset management as well as technical assistance is provided for the SGRE segment’s windturbines and is also being expanded for third party assets.
9.3 Basis of Preparation
9.3.1 Separation from Siemens
On May 7, 2019, Siemens AG announced its plans to publicly list the Siemens Energy business on
the stock exchange in the form of a spin-off, by issuing Siemens Energy shares to theshareholders of Siemens AG. Following Spin-Off Completion, 55.0% of the Siemens Energy AGshares will be transferred to the shareholders of Siemens AG. Subsequently, the shares in SiemensEnergy AG will be listed on the stock exchange (see “ 5 Carve-Out, Spin-Off and Listing ”). Siemens
will retain a shareholding of initially 45.0% but conditional upon Spin-Off Completiontransferred 9.9% of the Shares to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. (see “ 5.3.4 Corporate Structure
After the Spin-Off ”). For information regarding the establishment of the Company, see
“14.1 Formation, Incorporation, Commercial Register, Name ”.
In order to combine the Siemens Energy business within the Group, certain carve-out and
reorganization measures have been undertaken and implemented in the fourth quarter of thefiscal year 2019 and the first three quarters of the fiscal year 2020 (for more details, see “ 5.2 The
Carve-Out and the Capital Increases Against Contribution in Kind ”). The separation of the
108
Siemens Energy business from Siemens will be mostly completed with the Spin-Off (see “ 5.3 The
Spin-Off ”).
As of the Spin-Off Completion, Siemens Energy AG, Munich, Germany, will be the parent
company of Siemens Energy Group. Siemens Energy’s operating activities will be carried out by itssubsidiary SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, Munich, Germany, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
9.3.2 Preparation and Scope of the Combined Financial Statements
9.3.2.1 Preparation of the Combined Financial StatementsThe Audited Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the EU. The Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements wereprepared in accordance with IFRS on interim financial reporting (IAS 34).
Since IFRS provides no guidelines for the preparation of Combined Financial Statements, rules
given in IAS 8.12 have been used. IAS 8.12 requires the consideration of the most recentpronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial requirements and recognizedindustry practices. Following IAS 8.12, the predecessor accounting approach was applied in theCombined Financial Statements of Siemens Energy. The same accounting policies andmeasurement principles were applied in preparing the Combined Financial Statements as used bythe Siemens Energy entities and operations in preparing their financial information for inclusionin the consolidated financial statements of Siemens AG, which are prepared in accordance withIFRS, for the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 (“ Siemens AG IFRS Consolidated Financial
Statements ”). Accounting estimates originally used in the Siemens AG IFRS Consolidated
Financial Statements have not been adjusted to reflect potential new knowledge before beingincluded in the Combined Financial Statements.
The Audited Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Energy reflect the following businesses
as included in the Siemens AG Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year 2019,adjusted for legal entities where no legal transfer to Siemens Energy is planned, namely:
(i) the Siemens segment “Gas and Power”;(ii) the Siemens segment “SGRE”; and(iii) the following Siemens’ businesses that fall within the scope of Siemens Energy’s Gas and
Power segment: process solutions business, excluding the minerals business; subsea business;distribution transformer business; the hydrogen solution unit and research activities withinthe technology field “power-to-x” and storage; at-equity investments in Voith HydroHolding GmbH & Co. KG and EthosEnergy Group Limited; and the 24% minorityshareholding (as of June 30, 2020) in Siemens Ltd., India (“ Siemens India ”) acquired under a
share transfer agreement dated March 30, 2020, which is fully consolidated at Siemens AG.There is an exclusive agency and distributorship agreement in place, regulating that SiemensIndia will continue to execute the gas and power business. For more information on theconduct of the Gas and Power segment’s business in India, see “ 12.3.4.2.3 Shareholding in
Siemens India ” and “ 18.1.1.1.1(6) Agreements Related to the Conduct of Siemens Energy’s
Gas and Power Business in India ”). In some other countries (including Algeria, Greece,
Indonesia and Pakistan) the local gas and power business was not transferred to SiemensEnergy due to, e.g., limited size or regulatory reasons. Instead, Siemens Group companies
will continue to execute the gas and power business on the basis of agency anddistributorship agreements entered into with Siemens Energy for their own account (see“18.1.1.1.1(5) Agreements with regard to Siemens Energy’s Gas and Power Business in
Algeria, Greece, Indonesia and Pakistan ”).
The financial information for the segments Gas and Power and SGRE included in the Unaudited
Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements is derived from the segment reporting ofSiemens Group, before applying the presentation and measurement principles of IFRS 5 fordiscontinued operations. The segment reporting included certain cost allocations for centrallymanaged functions prior to the legal separation. The financial information for the minority stakein Siemens India is derived from the Siemens AG IFRS reporting package of this entity.
109
In order to reflect the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that fall within the scope of
Siemens Energy, certain combination rules as set out in Note 1 to the Audited CombinedFinancial Statement have been applied. The managing board and supervisory board of SiemensAG, the executive board of Siemens Energy and the board of directors and remaining seniormanagement staff (who are not members of the board of directors) of SGRE S.A. (together, the“Management ”) used significant judgment in determining these combination rules for the
preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited CondensedCombined Interim Financial Statements, respectively. Thus, the Combined Financial Statementspresented in this Prospectus do not necessarily reflect the net assets, financial position, results ofoperations or cash flows that would have resulted if Siemens Energy had existed as a separategroup in the periods presented.
9.3.2.2 Scope of Combination
The scope of combination for the Combined Financial Statements was determined on the
principles of the legal reorganization approach. This approach is based on the fact that theeconomic activities that form the new group were not managed centrally in the past, but thatthe entities are legally bound together within a reorganization process. During the reportingperiods of the Combined Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities forming the combinationscope were under common control of Siemens AG.
The scope of combination includes companies and businesses that will be directly or indirectly
and fully or partially owned by Siemens Energy AG after the legal reorganization and theSpin-Off of the Siemens Energy Group has been completed. This includes entities that werecontrolled by Siemens AG or its subsidiaries during the reporting periods of the CombinedFinancial Statements and for which a legal transfer to Siemens Energy AG is planned prior to theSpin-Off. Accordingly, the 40% participation Siemens Group holds in the joint venture ShanghaiElectric Power Generation Equipment Co., Ltd., China, the transfer of which shall occur in thefiscal year 2021 (see “ 12.3.2.1.1(3) Shanghai Electric Power Generation Equipment Co., Ltd. ”),
does not fall within the scope of combination. Businesses in accordance with IFRS 3 undercommon control that were transferred to Siemens Energy during the legal reorganization areincluded with their respective assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses in theCombined Financial Statements for all periods during which Siemens AG controlled these entities.
For legal entities transferring to Siemens Energy that had already been fully dedicated to the
Siemens Energy business and for which no carve-out has been required, the Combined FinancialStatements also include all non-business assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the legal entity(mainly financing activities and real estate). For legal entities that required a legal separation,certain assets and liabilities or obligations transferred to Siemens Energy that historically havenot been part of the Siemens Energy business are recognized in the Combined FinancialStatements at the time of the transfer as further detailed in Note 1 to the Audited CombinedFinancial Statements.
9.4 Principal Factors Affecting the Results of Operations
9.4.1 Trends in the Energy Sector
Our results of operations are affected by certain trends in the energy sector. Among others, these
trends include global energy demand, which is projected to increase in the mid- to long-term, inparticular a projected rising demand for electricity and an increasing electrification of largesectors of the economy, the trend towards decarbonization, including sector coupling and theincreasing use of hydrogen (in particular “green” hydrogen) as well as the trend towardsdigitalization in the energy markets. For more information on these industry trends, see“11 Industry Overview”, in particular “11.1.3 General Trends in the Energy Sector”.
9.4.1.1 Trends Impacting the Gas and Power Segment
In general, the markets of our Gas and Power segment are strongly affected by changes in
energy demand, national energy regulations (such as support of renewable energy), security of
110
supply through capacity markets or strategic reserve capacity, carbon pricing and climate change
targets, and modernization of energy and electricity markets (on these trends, see“11.1.3 General Trends in the Energy Sector ”).
The Transmission division of our Gas and Power segment benefits from these structural trends in
the energy sector. Decarbonization is shifting the focus of both centralized and distributedpower generation from conventional to renewables. This shift increases demand for offshoreconnectivity and grid stability, requiring environmentally friendly products and systems. Theintegration of wind power, photovoltaic (“ PV”), biomass and other intermittent or distributed
energy resources as well as of energy storage into efficient and reliable power networksincreases grid complexity. Expanding economies and rising demand for power, mainly indeveloping countries from the Asian markets (excluding China), are fueling the demand forpower transmission networks. Many developed countries, including the United States andEuropean countries, are also investing in improving their aging power infrastructure with newand advanced technologies, and we expect that countries in the Asia, Pacific region will invest inreplacing and refurbishing their existing grid infrastructure as well. Growth in demand fortransmission technologies is driven by large-scale sector coupling, for instance the increase ofgreen hydrogen production in countries with cheap electricity from renewable sources. Theincrease of efficiencies of existing grid assets and their performance through digitalization isbecoming more important. Furthermore, the integration of renewables into the power grid alsorequires the adoption of new technologies because of increased complexity, not only fortransmitting power, owing to their intermittent power generation, but also for energy storage.With substantial renewable energy mandates in place, several European countries, the UnitedStates and China are currently heavily investing in grid-scale energy storage projects.Digitalization involves increased product and system connectivity and providing intelligentsolutions for the management of complex energy networks. Connected assets provide valuepotential for additional services and enhanced asset operation. These structural trends are to asignificant degree driven by energy policy relating to power generation and grid infrastructure,including tax incentives in the U.S. and regulatory frameworks in the European Union, whichaffect our customers’ spending behavior and consequently, the demand for our offerings. Ontrends specifically affecting our Transmission division, see further “ 11.2.2 Market Size,
Development and Trends ”.
For our Generation division, the effects of the aforementioned structural trends in the energy
sector vary, as some countries focus on base load generation from conventional energy sourceswhile other countries focus on decarbonization and shift to renewable sources. In general, thepower generation industry has started an energy transition moving from conventional powergeneration to renewable sources, with a significant decrease on the relevance of coal. Theongoing strong growth in demand for power from renewable sources, which come withassociated short-term fluctuations in power generation levels, is however shifting marketdemand, in particular in Europe, Latin America and Asia, from fossil fuel baseload generation tomore flexible, highly efficient and affordable gas power plants with low emissions. In the fiscalyears 2017 and 2018, the markets for large steam turbines and gas turbines for centralized powergeneration continued to shrink due to an ongoing shift from coal-fired to gas-fired andrenewable power generation, given their lower emissions. This shift was also driven by carbonemission regulation. In the fiscal year 2019, the markets for industrial steam turbines andmedium gas turbines were stable. In the mid- to long-term, gas-fired generation is expected toincrease by nearly 50% until 2040, in part as a result of its role in providing flexibility to powersystems (see “ 11.3.2 Market Size, Development and Trends ”). We expect central generation
services to remain stable. We believe that the stability of this business is supported by our large(and regionally diversified) fleet, demand for modernizations of existing customer assets to meetfuture decarbonization targets and digital solutions for further performance optimization. Thedecentralization trend is positively impacting our Generation division’s distributed generationbusiness, with industrial demand mostly coming from industrialized countries in Europe and theAmericas as well as emerging economies in Asia. For trends specifically affecting our Generationdivision, see further “ 11.3.2 Market Size, Development and Trends ”.
111
For our Industrial Applications division, the role of natural gas compared to other fossil fuels is
growing in the oil & gas industry in the mid- to long-term, facilitated by its lower carbonfootprint. Furthermore, declining production due to maturing or depleting oil and gas fields,requires improved recovery technologies necessitating continuous investments in additionalmechanical and electrical power. At the same time, oil & gas companies increasingly focus onasset economics and emission footprint which requires products and solutions offering at highlevel of asset productivity, safety and environmental performance. This trend drives, amongstother things, the demand for efficiency-related modernizations and upgrades of existing/brownfield equipment offered by the Industrial Applications division. For trends specificallyaffecting our Industrial Applications division, see further “ 11.4.2 Market Size, Development and
Trends ”.
9.4.1.2 Trends Impacting the SGRE Segment
Demand for the offerings of our SGRE segment is primarily affected by global energy demand
and the share of renewable energy in energy production. The share of renewable energy in theglobal energy mix is widely expected to increase, in particular due to the continuing trendtowards decarbonization and more sustainable energy production (see “ 11.5.2 General Market
Characteristics, Trends and Drivers ”). However, the trend towards evaluating competing power
sources using life cycle costs continues to put pressure on the prices offered by wind powerproviders. Market development also strongly depends on energy policy, including tax incentivesin the U.S. and regulatory frameworks in the European Union. However, with continuedtechnological progress and cost reduction, dependency on subsidy schemes is expected tocontinue to decrease.
The introduction of auctions as a mechanism for allocating renewable energy capacity or
production in electricity markets has historically resulted in price pressure and an increase incompetition among wind turbine manufacturers (and with other energy sources with respect totechnology-neutral auctions). In addition, with the global transition from feed-in-tariffs toauction mechanisms to procure renewables-based electricity at competitive prices largelycompleted, the wind energy market has seen a stabilization of price levels in recent auctions, forexample in onshore auctions in several countries in 2019, after the introduction of auctions inprevious years had led to a sharp decline in prices (see “ 11.5.2.1 Trends Relating to Market
Mechanisms ”). However, local and structural issues can still overlay this trend as, for example a
market downturn in India in 2020 has shown. A higher share of renewable energy in electricalgrids also increases the demand for predictability of the energy supply and increased capabilityfor integrating it into the overall energy mix. Moreover, the attractive auction prices have inreturn triggered discussions on a further increase of the national target volumes in severalcountries, which would act as a positive factor for the SGRE segment.
For more information on trends relevant to our SGRE segment, see “ 11.5.2 General Market
Characteristics, Trends and Drivers ”.
9.4.2 Global Economic and Geopolitical Conditions
The global nature of our activities means that demand for our products, integrated systems,
solutions and services, and, therefore, our results of operations have, and will continue to be,affected by global economic and geopolitical conditions. Deteriorating economic conditions,adverse geopolitical conditions and uncertainties about future conditions could cause ourcustomers to delay, cancel or refrain from placing orders with us. Economic and geopoliticalconditions also affect, and are affected by, market prices for oil and gas. We believe that ourbroad portfolio with offerings for almost the entire value chain in the energy industry and inmany process industries, as well as for other industrial applications adds resilience to ourbusiness. The mix of products, systems and solutions we offer also includes execution of multi-year projects, often with high volumes. Depending on the type of product, system or solution, weagree delivery terms or construction phases ranging up to multiple months or years with ourcustomers. Generally, changes of global economic or geopolitical conditions, including their
112
effects on oil and gas prices, may therefore not always impact our results immediately, or to the
same relative extent to such changes.
Furthermore, our service business is affected by these changes to a lesser degree as we service a
large share of our installed fleet of units, often with long lifespans, and for which we in manycases conclude multi-year service contracts. Our service business in particular shows resilience toadverse short- and mid-term changes in global economic conditions and oil and gas prices due tothe need of many of our customers to maintain mission-critical assets and increase efficiencies(see also “ 9.4.5.2 Recurring Profitable Revenue From Our Service Business”).
9.4.2.1 General Effects of Changes in Oil and Gas Prices
Demand for certain of our products, systems solutions and services, in particular for elements of
our Gas and Power segment and its Generation and Industrial Applications divisions, is to acertain degree affected by oil and gas prices. Since oil and gas prices are set on a commoditybasis, spot market and futures market prices, their volatility, but also storage capacities impactour customers’ business activities and their investment behavior. Market prices for oil and gasdepend on a number of factors, including global or local supply and demand, inventory levels,available infrastructure (including means of transportation) macroeconomic and geopoliticalconditions and certain trends in the oil & gas industry (see also “ 9.4.1.1 Trends Impacting the Gas
and Power Segment ”). The demand for oil and gas has in the past been highly correlated with
global economic growth.
In the event of long-term low or volatile oil and gas prices or when such prices are expected to
be low over a longer period in the future, customers in certain market segments in which our Gasand Power segment is active may reduce their capital expenditures. This is particularly applicablein the upstream and midstream segment of the oil & gas market, served by the IndustrialApplications division. Customers whose activities in the oil & gas industry primarily depend onprofitability, cash, and return on investment may decide to postpone or even cut capitalexpenditures, affecting demand for certain elements of our portfolio such as compressors,industrial gas turbines, subsea products or other offerings. For example, beginning in 2012, crudeoil prices saw a steep decline up until 2016, falling from average monthly prices of over USD 100per barrel (“ bbl”) of crude oil (Brent) to below average monthly USD 50/bbl of crude oil (source:
Rystad, “ServiceDemandCube” database, retrieved in August 2020). This decline stronglyimpacted market volumes mainly during the 2016-2017 period. According to Rystad (source:Rystad, “How will low oil prices and COVID-19 impact the energy supply chain”, April 8, 2020),weighted average cost compression in the upstream market experienced a decline of around37% between 2014 and 2017 due to such oil price changes. Operating expenditure is less volatilewith respect to oil price volatility compared to capital expenditure.
Certain countries that are heavily dependent on income from oil and gas may curtail investments
in capital intensive oil & gas projects as well as power generation and transmission projectsduring periods of long-term low or expected low demand for oil and gas due to insufficientfunds. This in turn could lead to less demand for certain of our Gas and Power segment’sproducts, solutions and services, in particular for large projects in the Transmission and theGeneration divisions.
Generally, market environments characterized by long-term low oil and gas prices may prompt
some of our customers to shift their expenditure towards solutions and services that increaseoperational efficiency. For example, during the oil price downturn of 2016, the oil & gas industryexperienced a strong push to higher operational efficiency and cost adjustment which enabledmarket recovery. This may in turn increase demand for Siemens Energy’s Industrial Applicationsofferings addressing such customer needs.
For the above reasons (see “ 9.4.2 Global Economic and Geopolitical Conditions ”), we believe that
our services business shows resilience against adverse changes in oil and gas prices. Furthermore,we are active in the downstream segment of the oil & gas industry and other process industriessuch as fiber, chemical, or marine industries that are less affected or even benefit from low prices
113
for feedstock. In addition, services for the distributed and industrial power generation industries
are also generally less affected by long-term low oil and gas prices.
Moreover, while long-term low or volatile oil and gas prices may put short-term pressure on
power generation from renewables, they have shifted spending in the overall energy market toother energy sources, in particular renewables, which has led to increased Orders for the offeringof our SGRE segment or sustainable power generation offerings from our Gas and Powersegment and this trend may continue in the future during long periods of low or volatile oil andgas prices. This is reflected in the positive Order Backlog development of SGRE over the pastthree years (see “ 9.4.4 High Revenue Visibility From Order Backlog ”).
9.4.2.2 Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Oil Price Drop in Early 2020
During the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, our business was adversely affected by
COVID-19 as well as by its impact on the economic environment, our customers and suppliers. Theimpact of COVID-19 on our business varied between countries, regions and even cities andcommunities. Primarily, we faced a decline in demand, shifted and cancelled order awards,restricted access to customer sites, reduced capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilitiesdue to lockdowns or other forms of restrictions, delayed project execution and services leading toadditional costs, and challenges in certain segments of our supply chain. With regard to specificsegments of our supply chain, we experienced longer lead times. A significant challenge for oursupply chain was the shortage of freight services, leading to higher freight costs.
Impact from COVID-19 was most pronounced in March and April of 2020. During these months,
government lockdowns and quarantines imposed on parts of our Gas and Power segment’sworkforce mainly affected our manufacturing facilities and also repair workshops, e.g., in France,
India and Italy as well as to a lesser degree in Canada and Colombia. Reduced capacity utilizationresulted in significant underabsorption of fixed costs. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, weimplemented flexible working models, re-routed manufacturing to less impacted facilities andalso temporary increased loads in such facilities. The Transmission division of our Gas and Powersegment was less affected by lockdown and mandatory closure of sites as some of itsmanufacturing facilities were deemed system critical and thus exempted from measures imposedby authorities to mitigate the effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Transmissiondivision experienced a high level of project shifts during March and April 2020, leading to adecline in revenue and underabsorption of fixed costs. The project business of our Gas and Powersegment was particularly impacted by hindrances to send personnel on our customers’ sites. Theservice business in particular of our Generation division and, to a certain extent, of our IndustrialApplications division was adversely affected by travel bans hindering us to send our servicepersonnel on site, which led to a loss of productivity and revenue. Furthermore, some customersites were partially or fully closed down. In addition, the service business of our IndustrialApplications division was negatively affected by the closures of service shops. At the same time,we saw demand for technical risk assessments from customers whose equipment was operatingbeyond recommended service intervals. We also switched to remote diagnostics services. In ourGeneration division, scheduled outages were shifted. As part of our mitigation efforts, weswitched to remote support services wherever possible. Despite COVID-19, during the nine-monthperiod ended June 30, 2020, only a limited number of scheduled outages were shifted orcancelled.
From May 2020 onwards, the situation also improved in our Gas and Power segment. However,
while most of our impacted manufacturing facilities reopened and are running on high loadsagain, a significant number of customer sites are still either closed or ramping up only slowly.With regard to scheduled outages, the situation also improved, with less scheduled outagesbeing shifted to later periods.
Our SGRE segment, mainly its onshore wind turbine business, was also impacted by temporary
government lockdowns of manufacturing facilities, e.g., in China, India and Spain. The segment’s
supply chain was mainly impacted by shortages of supply of components and raw materials suchas balsa wood, which to obtain had already been challenging in the first quarter of the fiscal year
114
2020. Supply chain challenges also contributed to reduced capacity utilization of manufacturing
facilities and declines in productivity, which resulted in underabsorption of fixed costs. In theonshore wind turbine business, the impact of COVID-19 contributed to delays in the execution ofprojects in Northern Europe and to the continuing slow-down of the Indian market, contributingto a decline in revenue from this business and resulting in additional costs. Orders were shiftedinto later periods, also attributable to delayed contract signings. Delays in project execution ledto customer claims for damages. The offshore wind turbine business and the service business wasless impacted by COVID-19. Declines in Orders and revenue in the offshore wind turbine businesswere in line with pre-COVID-19 expectations due to market-specific volatility after strong Ordersin the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, the SGRE segmentorganized teams to ensure business continuity, partly by leveraging the Group’s worldwidefootprint to recover lost manufacturing capacity and mitigate challenges in specific markets.
In our SGRE segment, already at the end of the second quarter of the fiscal year 2020, the
segment’s Chinese manufacturing facilities resumed normal operations, while manufacturingfacilities in Spain resumed their operations in May 2020. In India, operations continued to beimpacted in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2020.
For information on the effects of COVID-19 and associated risks see also “ 3.1.3 Our industries and
business operations are subject to various risks relating to global or local outbreaks of infectiousdiseases and other public health crises. In particular, we are affected from the fallout of theoutbreak of the recent Coronavirus pandemic. ”.
Moreover, in early 2020, oil prices dropped sharply due to demand contraction caused by the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and simultaneous high oversupply volumes. This resulted inadverse effects on our business, in particular on the Industrial Applications division’s oil & gasindustry business. Oil companies announced significant cuts to their capital expenditures, which,together with COVID-19, affected demand particularly for the offering of our IndustrialApplications division, in particular in the upstream and midstream segment of the oil & gasindustry.
In the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, COVID-19, among other factors, contributed to a
decrease of total revenue in the SGRE segment while total revenue of the Gas and Powersegment remained nearly flat when compared with total revenue in the same period of the fiscalyear 2019. In the Gas and Power segment, the Transmission division was affected the most,mainly due to project shifts and cancellations but could level total revenue with the prior yearperiod. The Generation division’s revenue slightly declined from the level of the nine-monthperiod ended June 30, 2019, also impacted by COVID-19. The Industrial Applications division sawmoderately increasing total revenue period-over-period due to a strong new unit business, drivenby high Orders in the previous periods, while the division’s revenue from service was stable. Inour SGRE segment, COVID-19 exacerbated the slow-down of the Indian market and contributedto the delay of certain projects in Northern Europe, leading, among others, to a decline ofrevenue of the segment’s onshore business. The SGRE segment’s revenue from the offshorebusiness saw substantial decrease in revenue in line with project execution planning. Growth ofthe segment’s service business was partly driven by the acquisition of Senvion assets (see“9.4.8.4 Acquisition of Senvion Group Assets ”).
We believe that, for the reasons described under “ 9.4.2 Global Economic and Geopolitical
Conditions ”, in particular the strong contribution of the service business of our Gas and Power
segment’s Generation and Industrial Applicati ons divisions to revenue and profitability (see
“9.4.4 High Revenue Visibility From Order Backlog ” and “ 9.4.5.2 Recurring Profitable Revenue From
Our Service Business ”), and additional reasons primarily relating to the specific offerings of our
segments, divisions and specific characteristi cs of their markets, our business shows resilience
against the short- to mid-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil price drop in early2020. For our expectations with regard to the effects of COVID-19 and the oil price drop in early2020 on our markets in the short- and mid-term, see for our Gas and Power segment’s Transmissiondivision “ 11.2.2 Market Size, Development and Trends ” for its Generation division “ 11.3.2 Market
Size, Development and Trends ” and for its Industrial Applications division “ 11.4.2 Market Size,
Development and Trends ”; for our SGRE segment, see “ 11.5.3 Market Size and Development ”.
115
9.4.2.3 Geopolitical Conditions
With respect to geopolitical conditions, our results of operations may, among other factors, be
affected by the imposition of new trade barriers or sanctions which may prohibit us from doingbusiness in certain countries, including execution of our Order Backlog, as happened due to theimposition of sanctions by the United States on Iran in 2018. For further information ongeopolitical conditions affecting our results of operations, see “ 3.1.6 Political instability,
international conflicts or new trade barriers may have a negative effect on our business, financialposition and results of operations. ”.
9.4.3 Competition
Our results are also affected by competition in the markets in which we are active. The intensity
of competition we face and, consequently, the impact on our results of operations, differ amongthe relevant markets.
In the Transmission division of our Gas and Power segment, the competitor landscape is complex.
Apart from some large global players, there are many small companies typically specialized inparticular market segments and concentrated on specific regions. For certain parts of thetransmission solutions business, such as the large high-voltage direct current (“ HVDC ”) or grid
access projects within our solutions business, we face a limited number of strong globalcompetitors. However, as capacities for these projects in the industry have generally beenlimited, the impact of competition on prices for large HVDC or grid access projects has been lesspronounced. In the future, we expect new competitors to emerge, specifically from the Asia,Australia region which could lead to increasing price pressure in our large projects business aswell. In our Transmission division’s service business, we face several smaller local independentservice providers with (in many cases) aggressive pricing strategies, multi-brand service offerings,lean set-ups and low cost structures. For more information, see “ 11.2.3 Competitive
Environment ”.
The Generation division of our Gas and Power segment is facing intense competition from strong
established competitors, other companies active in our industries and competitors from emergingmarkets, which were previously active locally but are increasingly entering global markets. In therelevant markets we also face competition from new industries, which may have morecompetitive offerings, both in terms of sophistication and cost structure. Pricing pressure exists asmarket participants often undertake pricing strategies that are specifically aimed at gaining orprotecting market share and increasing the utilization of production capacity. Competition isparticularly intense in times of declining demand or overcapacities in the market as competitors,in order to retain or increase utilization of production capacity, are tempted to support theirsales volumes by lowering prices (or refrain from adjusting their prices to increased cost of sales).For example, especially the large gas turbine market experienced years of continuous pricedecline due to intense competition and overcapacities among original equipment manufacturers(“OEM ”) and engineering, procurement and construction (“ EPC”) contractors, resulting in strong
price pressure. Overcapacity among OEMs and EPC contractors has led to market consolidation inrecent years, which also affected the intensity of competition. Competing in such marketenvironments may lead to lower revenues or depress margins. For more information, see“11.3.3 Competitive Environment ”.
The competitor landscape in our Industrial Applications division’s markets is complex. Most
companies typically specialize in particular market segments, but there are only a few companiesthat are present across several value chain segments. In the service business, we compete mainlywith independent service providers as well as with other regional and local players. For severalproducts, we also face competition regarding service activities from other OEMs. For moreinformation, see “ 11.4.3 Competitive Environment ”.
Due to the system-critical nature of many of our products and solutions it is of major importance
to our customers, particularly in the Generation and Industrial Applications division of our Gasand Power segment, that their equipment be reliable. OEMs such as Siemens Energy aregenerally in a better position to service their own branded equipment and this expertise enables
116
us to service a large share of our installed fleet, even when customers have their own
maintenance personnel (see also “ 9.4.5.2 Recurring Profitable Revenue From Our Service
Business ” below). Although we also experience competition from other OEM and non-OEM
service providers in our service business, especially in the Generation and Industrial Applicationsdivisions, we are able to mitigate the impact by productivity measures taking effect during thelifetime of our long-term service contracts.
The competitive situation for our SGRE segment differs in the three market segments, onshore,
offshore and service. The SGRE segment competes with international OEMs, Chinese OEMs andother regional OEMs, with Chinese OEMS and other regional OEMs primarily focused on theirlocal markets. The market for onshore wind turbines is more fragmented although consolidationin the segment has increased concentration of market shares outside China. In the offshore windenergy market there is a lower number of competitors due to the relatively high entry barriersbut competition with regard to wind turbine prices is also strong and influenced by theintroduction of auction mechanisms. Consolidation is moving forward in both on- and offshoremarkets and is driven by market players striving for scale to address technological challenges,which increase development costs, and market accessibility challenges. However, majorinternational OEMs have communicated a pricing stabilization during recent quarters. It is to beexpected that the trend towards increasing nameplate ( i.e., nominal) capacity as well as blade
size and related competition will also continue in the coming years, further resulting in increasedchallenges relating to the manufacturing and logistics. The service business of the wind energymarket is mainly served by OEMs, however also by independent service providers and anincreasing share of customers are insourcing operation & maintenance (“ O&M ”) activities. These
are mainly large utilities with a significant installed fleet size. In the rapidly changing marketenvironment of the wind energy industry, most owners expand their fleets beyond a singleturbine manufacturer, either due to economic or performance-related considerations, or throughthe integration of fleets resulting from mergers & acquisitions activities. This results in challengesfor service providers such as SGRE (and for owners as well). For more information, see“11.5.4 Competitive Environment ”.
9.4.4 High Revenue Visibility From Order Backlog
Our ability to generate revenues depends on Orders for our products, solutions and services. Our
large Order Backlog gives us high visibility of future revenues as many of our Orders relate to amulti-year project business, often involving high volumes, and service business with stretched outrevenue recognition (on our service business, see also “ 9.4.5.2 Recurring Profitable Revenue From
Our Service Business ”). Due to multi-year projects in our solutions business, we have a high level
of visibility on future revenues. In our service business, existing long-lasting service contracts andregular service intervals generally also give us visibility to assess future revenues.

3)Book-to-Bill Ratio is defined as the ratio of Orders to total revenue for a specified period.
4)Not available. The Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements do not contain information on
Order Backlog as of June 30, 2019.
Over the fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, Order Backlog of Siemens Energy increased at a
compound annual growth rate (“ CAGR ”) of 4.9%. We believe our high volume of Orders over
the periods presented (for detailed discussions, see “ 9.7.2.1 Orders ”, “9.7.3.1 Orders ” and
“9.7.4.1 Orders ”) leading to our Order Backlog of €82 billion as of June 30, 2020, gives us a solid
basis for future sustainable revenue generation. In the fiscal years 2019 and 2018, we were ableto record a robust Book-to-Bill Ratio of above 1, with 1.2 in the fiscal year 2019 and 1.1 in thefiscal year 2018. The Book-to-Bill Ratio above 1 from 2018 onwards demonstrates that we wereable to increase Orders ahead of revenue and thus our Order Backlog. In the fiscal year 2019,especially large Orders of our Transmission and Generation divisions in our Gas and Powersegment contributed to this development (see “9.7.3.1 Orders” ). In the fiscal year 2018, the
Book-to-Bill Ratio above 1 was largely attributable to our SGRE segment, where portfolio effectsof the merger had a stronger impact on Orders than on revenue. Moreover, our SGRE segment’sOrders in the fiscal year 2018 included a contract for an offshore wind power plant, includingservice, in the United Kingdom worth about €1.3 billion (see “ 9.7.4.1 Orders ”).
Our Orders and Order Backlog form the basis of future sustainable revenue generation.
Therefore, the number of large orders we are able to win directly affects the short- and mid-termreliability and solidity of our revenue levels. In any given reporting period, Orders for largeprojects may depend on our own abilities to successfully bid for projects and project-specificfactors such as the granting of permits required for a specific project and availability of funding.Certain large projects have however induced volatility to our Orders or revenue levels and maycontinue to do so in the future. For example, the Gas and Power segment recognized comparablyhigh revenue in the fiscal year 2017 from the execution of the project in Egypt (see“9.4.5.1 Project Business ”). With regard to Orders, a significant increase in Orders of the SGRE
segment in the fiscal year 2019 and the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 was attributableto Orders in connection with the construction of an offshore wind power nacelle assembly inTaiwan. The latter will also include testing, warehousing and office facilities. Production start isplanned for 2021, supporting specifically Ørsted’s 900 MW “Greater Changhua” 1 & 2a project,
119
for which the SG 8.0–167 DD turbine will be used, as well as the increasing business in the Asia,
Australia region. The order volume of the “Greater Changhua” project is €1.2 billion, including
€50 million service volume.
While Orders for large projects may lead to volatility in total Orders from reporting period to
reporting period, revenue is generally less affected from such volatility due to the fact that largeprojects in particular typically have longer development and construction phases and serviceorders often relate to long-term service contracts that therefore lead to revenue recognition overseveral reporting periods.
The Backlog-to-Revenue Ratio of Siemens Energy was 2.7, 2.5 and 2.3 as of September 30, 2019,
2018 and 2017, respectively. In the Gas and Power segment, the Backlog-to-Revenue Ratio was2.8, 2.5 and 2.2 as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and in the SGRE segment2.5, 2.5 and 2.7, respectively.
As of June 30, 2020, we expect to convert approximately €21 billion (or 26%) of the Order
Backlog into revenue within the fiscal year 2021 (thereof Gas and Power segment: approximately€12 billion; SGRE segment: approximately €8 billion). As of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017
we expected to convert approximately €23 billion (or 30%), approximately €22 billion (or 31%)
and approximately €21 billion (or 30%), respectively, of the Order Backlog into revenue within
one year (thereof Gas and Power segment: approximately €13 billion, approximately €13 billion
and approximately €14 billion, respectively; SGRE segment: approximately €9 billion,
approximately €9 billion and €7 billion, respectively). This stable level of Order Backlog Reach
demonstrates that the major part of revenue recognition of the following year was expected tobe generated from Order Backlog and led to a steady revenue development.
9.4.5 Product Portfolio and Business Mix
During any given period, our results of operations are affected by the mix of products, solutions
and services sold in each segment.
We believe that our activities as a supplier of technology along almost the entire energy value
chain in both conventional and renewable energy generation, energy transmission, oil & gas andother process industries together with the broad products, solutions and services portfolio addresilience to our business.
Because profitability levels differ significantly among our products, solutions or services, our
revenue and profit sources and levels depend on the business mix in a reporting period (for ourproject business, see “ 9.4.5.1 Project Business ”). With regard to revenue mix, from the fiscal year
2017 to the fiscal year 2019, total revenue of the Gas and Power segment declined at a CAGR of8.3% whereas total revenue of the SGRE segment increased at a CAGR of 13.6%. While thedecline of total revenue of the Gas and Power segment was also attributable to high revenuerecognized from the execution of the project in Egypt (“ 9.4.5.1 Project Business ”) in the fiscal
year 2017 and the SGRE segment profited from the merger that led to the formation of SGRE S.A.in the fiscal year 2017 (see “ 9.4.8.1 Merger of Gamesa and Siemens Wind Power into SGRE and
Acquisition of Iberdrola’s 8.1% Shareholding in SGRE ”), these developments shifted revenue
contribution of the Gas and Power segment and the SGRE segment from 73.7% and 26.3% oftotal revenue of Total Segments in the fiscal year 2017 to 64.7% and 35.3% in the fiscal year2019, respectively.

For an overview of our service business, see “ 9.4.5.2 Recurring Profitable Revenue From Our
Service Business ” below.
9.4.5.1 Project Business
In our project business, our ability to win Orders may not only affect our revenue mix (see also
“9.4.4 High Revenue Visibility From Order Backlog ”) but also our profitability as margins may
vary from market to market and from project to project. For example, in our SGRE segment,revenue mix and margins may vary depending on the mix of onshore and offshore projects. Inthe fiscal year 2017, the onshore wind turbine market declined, leading to a decrease in revenuefrom such market, while at the same time, revenue from the offshore wind turbine marketincreased. In the fiscal year 2018, the onshore wind turbine market recovered, leading to higherOrders. At the same time, prices in the onshore wind turbine market declined, leading to acontraction of margins. When compared to the onshore wind turbine business, in the case ofSGRE, the offshore wind turbine business is generally characterized by higher margins. This wasevident in the fiscal year 2019, when, despite year-on-year revenue increase, Adjusted EBITA ofthe SGRE segment remained nearly at the level of the fiscal year 2018, among other factors dueto a less favorable project mix because of a higher volume of lower margin onshore projects.
The execution of large Orders can also have substantial effects on the volatility of our revenue.
For example, in the fiscal year 2018, as part of Siemens, we completed the construction of theworld’s three largest combined-cycle power plants (“ CCPPs ”) in Beni Suef, El Burullus and New
Capital, Egypt, in collaboration with the Egyptian Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energyand consortium partners Orascom Construction and Elsewedy Electric. This project added anaggregate power output of up to 14.4 Gigawatt (“ GW”) to Egypt’s grid and involved the
installation of 24 H-class gas turbines, 12 steam turbines, 36 generators and three 500 kVgas-insulated switchgears and six substations to transmit the electricity generated in Egypt’stransmission system. Moreover, Siemens Energy signed long-term service contracts for all threepower plants and subsequent solution contracts in connection to the three power plants. Thisproject in Egypt has been one of the largest contracts in the history of Siemens Energy’s businesswith an initial order volume of about €3.7 billion, excluding service and subsequent contracts.
Construction began in 2015 and more than one-third of revenue for this project was recognizedin the fiscal year 2017, an amount which halved in 2018 and again halved in 2019. The amount ofservice orders recognized for the project in Egypt amounted to well above €1 billion, mostly
recorded in the fiscal year 2016.
In both segments, the profitability of our project business also depends on timely project
execution according to plan. Our project business also comprises projects with fixed prices.Deviations from budgeted costs can result in negative project margins if costs are not fullycovered by escalation clauses in our contracts or our project management is not able to mitigatehigher costs by change requests in the course of the project. Conversely, we can also experiencemargin upsides, for instance if actual costs turn out to be lower during project execution thaninitially estimated in project budgeting or supplier contracts can be renegotiated. We areaddressing such topics with a continuous risk and opportunities management prior and duringproject execution. The runtime of our projects can be several months or even years and we needto cope with unforeseen events or changes in conditions, leading to cost overruns,non-conformance costs or delays. These can have multiple reasons (which are partly beyond ourcontrol) as we are depending on variables such as environmental conditions at our construction
122
sites or undisrupted supply chains (see also “ 3.1.9 Extreme weather conditions due to climate
change may have a negative effect on our business. ”). Our contracts may include penalty clauses,
like for project delays or performance obligations, which can have a material adverse effect onour project results, if materialization cannot be avoided. Such risks may partially be covered byrisk contingencies or increases of planned costs, which are set up during the runtime of a projectwith negative effect on project profitability (for information on provisions for order relatedlosses and risks, see also Note 15 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements). In turn, therelease of these risk contingencies or if planned costs do not materialize lead to a positiveone-time effect. After project finalization, risks are usually covered by warranty provisions, set upaccording to past experience. Despite being targeted at straightening project revenues andproject profits over time, it is inherent to the percentage of completion (POC) accounting for ourlarge projects that positive or negative deviations from budgeted project results have aninfluence in line with the stage of completion. This may lead to aperiodic, cumulative effects,shown in the period the effect is recognized. Such aperiodic effects impact the comparability ofour results of operations and financial position between the reporting periods. In addition,declining demand for large projects may affect profitability if we are not able to utilize ourcapacities and a higher proportion of fixed costs cannot be absorbed by ongoing projects.
9.4.5.2 Recurring Profitable Revenue From Our Service Business
Our results of operations and margins depend to a significant degree on our ability to generate
revenue from servicing our large installed fleet as it becomes subject to wear and tear, inparticular for rotating equipment of the Gas and Power segment’s Generation and IndustrialApplications divisions and of the SGRE segment. Overall, the share of Total Segments’ totalrevenue from service of Total Segments’ total revenue was 33.0% in the fiscal year 2019 (fiscalyear 2018: 32.2%; fiscal year 2017: 29.6%). Over the fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, TotalSegments’ total revenue from service increased at a CAGR of 3.5%. Our service business typicallyhas higher margins than the new units businesses. Therefore, the share of our service businesswithin our revenue mix also affects our overall profitability.
Since the equipment in our installed fleet often has a long lifespan, maintaining and expanding
our large installed fleet and securing Orders for servicing contracts, in particular for long-termservice programs, enables us to generate recurring profitable revenue. Long-term servicecontracts typically stretch over approximately 12 and 9 years in our Gas and Power segment andour SGRE segment, respectively.
In our Gas and Power segment, the service business of our Generation division comprises
transactional and contractual business models for servicing of gas turbines, steam turbines,generators, I&C, auxiliaries, and all associated equipment throughout power plants in centralizedpower generation. The Generation division had more than 11,000 service-relevant gas and steamturbines, generators and engines as of June 30, 2020. The majority of its service business is basedon long-term programs as well as O&M, resulting in recurring revenue from individual customers.The Industrial Applications division had a service-relevant oil & gas fleet of more than 79,000units as of June 30, 2020, mostly comprised of gas turbines, steam turbines, compressors andgenerators. While a large share of the Industrial Applications division’s service business istransactional and covers spare parts, repairs, overhauls and field services, many customers signmulti-year service contracts, which provide recurring revenue from individual customers.Compared to the more complex rotating equipment of the Generation and IndustrialApplications divisions, the Transmission division’s products are less service-intensive. We believethat, across our divisions, our broad customer base across different market segments contributesto the resilience of the Gas and Power segment’s service businesses. In total, the Gas and Powersegment had more than 90,000 service-relevant units as of June 30, 2020 in its installed fleet.
The Gas and Power segment had a service share of 41.7% of its total revenue in the nine-month
period ended June 30, 2020 and of 42.4% of its total revenue in the fiscal year 2019. The serviceshare increased over the periods presented (fiscal year 2018: 40.2%; fiscal year: 2017: 35.0%). Theshare of the service business of the Generation and Industrial Applications divisions was
123
approximately 51% and approximately 60% of their respective total new unit and service
revenue (including intercompany service business) in the fiscal year 2019, while the Transmissiondivision showed a lower service share of approximately 8% of its total new unit and servicerevenue.
As of June 30, 2020, the SGRE segment had roughly 32,000 serviced turbines worldwide, with
more than 72 GW under maintenance. SGRE offers a wide range of services from maintenanceand repair services over upgrades to extend the life of an asset and overhaul services, offshorelogistics services, blade services and remote diagnostics to asset management services. The SGREsegment had a service share of 18.5% of its total revenue in the nine-month period endedJune 30, 2020 and of 15.8% of its total revenue in the fiscal year 2019. The service share slightlyincreased over the periods presented (fiscal year 2018: 15.6%; fiscal year 2017: 14.3%).

2020.
8)Not available. The Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements do not contain information on OrderBacklog as of June 30, 2019.
9)In fiscal year 2019, the division’s share of service revenue for Transmission, Generation and Industrial Applications wasapproximately 8%, 51% and 60%, respectively. The shares include intercompany service business and are calculated bydividing the respective Service revenue (total revenue) by division by the total of the service revenue (total revenue) and newunit revenue (total revenue) by division, i.e., for Transmission, Generation and Industrial Applications €5,928 million, €9,063
million and €5,300 million, respectively.
The Gas and Power segment’s service business contributed 83.1% and the SGRE segment’s service
business contributed 16.9% to Total Segments’ total revenue from service in the fiscal year 2019,respectively.
Total Segments’ Order Backlog included a service share of 58.5% as of June 30, 2020 and of
61.0%, 62.0% and 60.0% as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The segment Gasand Power’s service share in its Order Backlog was 64.7% as of June 30, 2020 and 67.3%, 68.8%and 65.3% as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In the SGRE segment, theservice share in its Order Backlog was 46.9% as of June 30, 2020 and 46.2%, 47.8% and 47.6% asof September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Total Segments’ Backlog-to-Revenue Ratio from service was 4.9, 4.9 and 4.7 as of September 30,
2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In the Gas and Power segment, the Backlog-to-Revenue Ratiofrom service was 4.4, 4.3 and 4.1 as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and inthe SGRE segment of 7.4, 7.7 and 8.8, respectively.
Because we service a large share of our installed fleet of often mission-critical units with
considerable lifespans, our service business generally shows high level of resilience towardsadverse changes in macroeconomic conditions (see “ 9.4.2 Global Economic and Geopolitical
Conditions ”). We therefore believe that recurring revenue from our service business offers
strength to our business.
9.4.6 Technological Innovation, Research and Development
Our revenue is driven by our ability to provide innovative products, integrated systems, solutions
and services and develop deep relationships with customers and project partners. We believe thatsustainable economic value is created through continuous innovation and that investment inresearch and development (“ R&D”) is fundamental to our success.
We steer all R&D activities of the Gas and Power segment to best address the challenges posed by
what we believe to be the market-defining mega trends: growing energy and electricity demand,decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization. Recent development highlights includeTopsides 4.0, the HL-class turbines, switchgears without Sulphur hexafluoride (“ SF
6”), increasing
hydrogen co-firing capabilities of our turbine fleet and industrial-scale electrolyzers.
R&D activities in our Transmission division focus on developing products and solutions that help
to increase the transient and dynamic stability of electrical grids, while improving the overalltransmission capacity, quality, reliability, availability and environmental compatibility. R&Dactivities in our Generation division focus on the development of new products and theimprovement of existing products, such as the advanced air-cooled 9000HL gas turbine productline with efficiencies over 63% in combined-cycle applications. In the fiscal year 2018, theGeneration division also sold the first units of our largest gas turbine model SGT-9000HL,
126
including a large solution order worth about €0.3 billion in the United Kingdom (“ UK”), that
reaches efficiencies beyond 63% in combined-cycle applications and is suitable for centralized,large-scale power generation application. R&D activities in our Industrial Applications divisionfocus on developing technologies that support decarbonization. This includes addressing thedimensions of our compression solutions, increasing efficiency in all our rotating equipment,reducing emissions in our gas turbine product lines. Further, our Industrial Applications divisiondevelops novel compression applications for cleaner gases in order to drive the decarbonizationof various industries. R&D activities of the Generation and Industrial Applications businessesconcentrate on developing products and solutions for enhancing efficiency and flexibility andreducing GHG emissions, in particular by increasing the hydrogen co-firing capabilities of our gasturbines. Our Gas and Power segment is also intensifying R&D in innovative materials, advancedmanufacturing methods (3D printing) and plant optimization. Innovations accordingly focus onproduct digitalization, power electronics, software-driven power control, environmentally-friendly products and systems, and grid stabilization. R&D activities in our New Energy Businessare aimed at supporting the transition towards a decarbonized world with electro-chemicalsolutions, including optimization of “power-to-hydrogen” plans and “power to-x” solutions.Investments in the Gas and Power segment in the periods presented focused on enhancing theGeneration and Industrial Applications divisions’ productivity through automation and increasingcustomer proximity via strategic localization of capacity. Investing activities mainly related to ourgas turbines and turbine components. For more information on the Gas and Power segment’sR&D activities, see “ 12.3.11 R&D ”.
Together with various research partners, our SGRE segment is developing new wind power
technologies with a view to increase both power and performance. Furthermore, the segmentfocuses on new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. The SGREsegment focused its investments on production equipment for new blade types and capacityexpansion in its factories. For more information on the SGRE segment’s R&D activities, see“12.4.4 R&D ”.
Our R&D efforts not only affect our ability to generate future revenue but also our profitability.
In the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, our research and development expensesamounted to €689 million (or 3.5% of our revenue) (nine-month period ended June 30, 2019:
€683 million (or 3.3% of our revenue)). Our capitalized development expenses (additions to
internally generated technology) amounted to €141 million in the nine-month period ended
June 30, 2020 (nine-month period ended June 30, 2019: €124 million).
In the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, our research and development expenses amounted to
€1,001 million (3.5% of our revenue), to €1,069 million (3.8% of our revenue) and to
€1,111 million (3.7% of our revenue), respectively. In the fiscal year 2019, our capitalized
research and development expenses (shown as additions to internally generated technology inNote 11 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements) amounted to €163 million (fiscal year
2018:€133 million; fiscal year 2017: €80 million).
By segment, in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, we incurred research and
development expenses excluding amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations and goodwill impairments in the Gas and Power segment of €530 million
(amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments:€5 million), or 4.0%, of the segment’s total revenue (nine-month period ended June 30, 2019:
€552 million (amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill
impairments: €5 million), or 4.1%, of the segment’s total revenue). The SGRE segment’s research
and development expenses amounted to €154 million, or 2.3%, of the segment’s total revenue
(nine-month period ended June 30, 2019: €126 million, or 1.7%, of the segment’s total revenue).
Both periods did not include any amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations and goodwill impairments in SGRE segment.
In the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, we incurred research and development expenses in the
Gas and Power segment excluding amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations and goodwill impairments of €787 million (amortization of intangible assets
127
acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments; €6 million), or 4.2%, of the
segment’s total revenue, €897 million (amortization of intangible assets acquired in business
combinations and goodwill impairments: €7 million), or 4.7%, of the segment’s total revenue
and€921 million (amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and
goodwill impairments: €1 million), or 4.1%, of the segment’s total revenue, respectively. The
SGRE segment’s total research and development expenses amounted to €208 million (or 2.0% of
the segment’s total revenue), €166 million (or 1.8% of the segment’s total revenue) and
€189 million (or 2.4% of the segment’s total revenue) in the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively. The periods presented did not include any amortization of intangible assetsacquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments for SGRE.
In the fiscal year 2019, Siemens Energy employed an average number of five thousand people
(based on headcount) working on R&D, of which an average number of three thousand peoplewere employed in the Gas and Power segment and two thousand in the SGRE segment.
9.4.7 Geographical Mix of Revenue
Our revenue is also affected by our geographic mix. The following table shows the revenue of
Siemens Energy by location of customer for the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, as well as forthe nine-month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018:

Over the periods presented, contributions by the EMEA, Americas and Asia, Australia regions
remained largely stable. Certain levels of variation in our geographical mix of revenue over timeare generally induced by, among other factors, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, theproduct mix in any given period, e.g., execution of large Orders in our project business for new
units may induce a certain level of volatility in our results in specific regions, and changes inforeign currency exchange rates, which affect our customers spending decisions. In addition, wegenerally sell our entire portfolio across all regions, resulting in a balanced geographic productmix that further contributes to resiliency and also balanced pricing and margin variations byregion. For our geographical mix of revenue, foreign currency exchange rates, in particularexchange rates of the relevant customer’s national currency against the U.S. dollar, play a majorrole as they affect our customers’ capital expenditures decisions and therefore also demand forour offerings from the relevant regions.
We believe that, on the Group-level, our mix of revenue by geographic region helps mitigate
revenue volatility in specific regions. For example, in the fiscal year 2019, revenue in the EMEAregion and the Americas increased by 5.9% and 5.5%, respectively, compensating a decrease ofrevenue in the Asia, Australia region, where revenue fell by 9.9%. In addition, revenuecontributions of our two reportable segments in specific regions from time to time have beensubject to opposing trends, mitigating the overall effect on the Group-level. For example, in the
128
fiscal year 2019, substantial revenue growth in the SGRE segment more than offset a decline in
revenues of the Gas and Power segment in the EMEA region while in the Americas region, anincrease in revenue in the Gas and Power segment offset a clear decline in revenue in the SGREsegment.
9.4.8 SGRE Merger; Acquisitions and Disposals
Our results of operations are affected by acquisitions and disposals of certain businesses. In the
periods presented, the following material acquisitions and disposals occurred:
9.4.8.1 Merger of Gamesa and Siemens Wind Power into SGRE and Acquisition of Iberdrola’s
8.1% Shareholding in SGRE
In April 2017, Siemens contributed its wind power business, including services, into the publicly
listed company Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica, S. A., Spain (“ Gamesa ”). The consideration
transferred by Siemens equaled 59% of Gamesa’s market capitalization at closing of the mergerand amounted to €3,669 million. In return for such consideration, Siemens received newly issued
shares corresponding to approximately 59% in the combined entity Siemens Gamesa RenewableEnergy, S. A., Spain. As part of the merger, Siemens paid €999 million in cash which was
distributed to the Gamesa shareholders (without Siemens) following the completion of themerger. The merger resulted in goodwill of €2,857 million as of the acquisition date April 3,
2017, and comprised intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know-how andexpected synergy effects from highly complementary businesses entailing an enhanced marketposition (including anticipated cost savings mainly in R&D, procurement and administration aswell as revenue synergies). SGRE’s activities linked to the post-merger integration of Gamesa andSiemens’ wind power business and operational improvement measures are still ongoing (see“9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items ”).
Following the merger, Siemens as a majority shareholder held 59% of the shares in SGRE S.A.
until Siemens AG’s acquisition of the 8.1% non-controlling interest in SGRE from Iberdrola S.A.for a purchase price of €1.1 billion in February 2020. In the Carve-Out, Siemens AG transferred
its shareholdings to Siemens Energy, which holds approximately 67% of the shares in SGRE S.A.
9.4.8.2 Disposal of the Single-stage and Wastewater Compressor and Small Steam Turbines
Business
In October 2017, Siemens Energy sold its single-stage and wastewater compressor business and its
small steam turbine business, both including service, for €193 million in cash and cash
equivalents. The sale resulted in a gain of €86 million in the fiscal year 2018 which was
recognized in the line item other operating income and presented in the Gas and Powersegment.
9.4.8.3 Disposal of Parts of the Government Business and U.S. Navy Service Centers
In April 2018, Siemens Energy sold part of its government business and U.S. Navy service centers
for€174 million in cash and cash equivalents. The sale resulted in a gain of €79 million in the
fiscal year 2018 which was recognized in the line item other operating income and presented inthe Gas and Power segment.
9.4.8.4 Acquisition of Senvion Group Assets
On October 20, 2019, Senvion GmbH i.L. and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy Eólica, S.L.U.
signed an agreement under which Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy Eólica, S.L.U. acquired onJanuary 9, 2020 all shares of Senvion Deutschland GmbH (Senvion European Onshore Services),which included the carved-out European onshore service business of Senvion and certainadditional assets associated to the business, including certain related intellectual property ofSenvion. Based on this agreement, on April 30, 2020, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A.,Portugal signed an agreement with Senvion Indústria, S.A., and Senvion GmbH i.L. by virtue ofwhich all the shares of Ria Blades, S.A., an entity which owns and operates the business of the
129
wind turbine blades production facility in Vagos (Portugal) and certain additional assets
associated to said business were acquired.
This acquisition is in line with SGRE’s strategy to grow its multibrand service business and its
production capacities and strengthens SGRE’s competitive position in Europe. The overall price tobe paid in cash for the shares of Senvion Deutschland GmbH and Ria Blades, S.A. amounts to€200 million, subject to closing accounts confirmation adjustments.
As of June 30, 2020, the preliminary estimate for the consideration to be transferred amounted
to€190 million ( €186 million net of cash acquired). Until June 30, 2020, the consideration paid
in accordance with the milestones established in the acquisition agreement amounted to€182 million ( €177 million net of cash acquired).
For more information, see Note 2 to the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial
Statements.
9.4.9 Personnel Costs
Our results are also affected by personnel costs. During the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017,
personnel costs remained relatively stable. Personnel costs (consisting of wages and salaries,statutory social welfare contributions and expenses for optional support as well as expensesrelating to post-employment benefits as shown in the Audited Combined Financial Statements)amounted to €7,525 million in the fiscal year 2019, €7,785 million in the fiscal year 2018 and
€7,663 million in the fiscal year 2017.
9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items
9.4.10.1 Restructuring and Integration Measures in our Gas and Power SegmentDuring the periods presented, we carried out restructuring and integration programs, some of
which are still ongoing and may lead to further measures, reflecting Siemens Energy’s endeavorto adapt to a changing market environment to improve the competitiveness of our operationsand integrate Siemens’ wind power business and Gamesa after the merger that led to theformation of SGRE S.A.
In our Gas and Power segment, the following programs were initiated (in succession to preceding
measures, which were substantially completed):
 In 2017, the Gas and Power segment initiated the program “PG 2020 Efficiency” in order to
counter a negative market development and improve cost structures. It defined measures toincrease efficiency, including headcount measures, which are to date substantiallycompleted, i.e., by and large the respective severance agreements have been signed. The
respective employees have largely left the company.
 The program “PG 2020 Efficiency” was extended as “PG 2020” in 2018 in order to ensure a
sustainable improvement of competitiveness and included measures on the Gas and Powersegment’s global footprint, sourcing and production capacities, targeting a reduction ofemployment positions worldwide. Under the program and after consultations a headcountreduction of globally approximately 6,400 is targeted, thereof approximately 2,300 inGermany. Today, the targeted reduction has been substantially completed, i.e., by and large
the respective severance agreements have been signed. Related savings are not fullyreflected in the development of personnel costs in the fiscal year 2019 since in parts, theemployees that agreed to an exit will leave Siemens Energy in the mid-term, depending onthe agreed exit dates, e.g., through early retirement agreements. Also savings were partly
compensated by merit increases. The program mainly focused on the Generation division ofthe Gas and Power segment. The major part of restructuring costs for this program wasincurred in the fiscal years 2018 and 2019. As part of these measures, Siemens Energy also
130
sold certain parts of its business, including a site for packaging and service of rotating
equipment in Hengelo, Netherlands, which resulted in a loss of €54 million in the fiscal year
2019, pertaining to the Gas and Power segment.
 In 2019, the program “GP 2020+” was initiated, focusing on cost structure optimization and
re-sizing of production capacities. Under the program and after consultations, a headcountreduction of globally approximately 2,400 is targeted, thereof approximately 1,100 inGermany. Today, the targeted reduction has been well progressed especially in Germany, i.e.,
the respective severance agreements have been signed by a large extent. A large part ofrestructuring costs for this program were incurred in the fiscal year 2019. In the context ofthe carve-out of our business, the focus of the re-sizing of support functions has nowbroadened to include also corporate functions ( i.e., in addition to business related support
functions), where potential future measures are still being evaluated and remain subject toconsultation with employee representatives.
 On September 1, 2020, we announced a restructuring of our Gas and Power segment’s
Le Havre facilities. The current plan foresees a headcount reduction of approximately 300,the closure of production activities while keeping certain operations. We estimate to incurpersonnel and non-personnel costs of €70 million to €100 million associated with the
transformation measures. The announced plan is still subject to change, especially followingthe outcome of the just started negotiations as per statutory requirements.
 We made a strategic portfolio decision to streamline our offering of aero-derivative gas
turbines. While we will continue to service all types of our aero-derivative gas turbines andstill deliver all aero-derivative gas turbines that have already been ordered, we will over timeno longer actively market our larger sized aero-derivative gas turbines. For moreinformation, see “ 12.3.3.1.2(2) Aero-Derivative Gas Turbines ”.
As of June 30, 2020, the Gas and Power segment achieved annual gross cost savings of almost
€500 million as compared to the fiscal year 2018. In addition, the programs “PG 2020” and “GP
2020+” are expected to achieve further annual global gross cost savings of at least €500 million
by the end of fiscal year 2023 as compared to the fiscal year 2018.
Furthermore, in order to achieve our mid-term targets, our Gas and Power segment aims for
further global cost savings by the end of fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2018. Forinformation on our mid-term targets, see “ 22.2 Outlook ”.
To achieve these targets, we are evaluating potential further restructuring and optimization
measures. As part of the ongoing evaluation process, we are closely analyzing how such measurescould be designed and what consequences they would have for Siemens Energy, our customersand our employees. While the evaluation process may further crystalize already in the nearfuture, no resolution has been made yet on future measures and these measures are subject toconsultation with employee representatives. Also, the findings of this process will be discussed inthe relevant committees, which will subsequently take a decision.
If we were to implement a further restructuring and optimization program, we believe that it is
likely to focus on footprint optimization, project execution and function optimization:
Footprint optimization and project execution – Main levers are likely going to be (i) a
consolidation of our global footprint including a streamlining of our logistics operations andan optimization of our factory network aimed at reducing complexity and overcapacities(supply chain excellence), (ii) an operational improvement focusing on: project managementimprovements aimed at significantly reducing non-conformance costs, the simplification ofdecision processes and project selectivity, i.e., focusing on projects with attractive return
profiles (project excellence), (iii) the completion of the integration of Dresser-Rand, a leadingprovider of compressors, steam and gas turbines, acquired in 2015 and (iv) a streamlining ofour portfolio. Related to footprint optimization and project execution forming part of theAccelerating Impact phase (see “ 12.2.2 Spin-Off allows for a step change in operational
performance ”), we aim for a minimum target of further annual global gross cost savings in
131
an amount of €300 million together with the announced restructuring of our Gas and
Power segment’s Le Havre facilities by the end of the fiscal year 2023 as compared to thefiscal year 2018.
Function optimization – In the context of the carve-out of our business, the focus of the
re-sizing of support functions within the “GP 2020+” program has now broadened to alsoconsider corporate functions in addition to business related support functions, wherepotential measures are still being evaluated and remain subject to consultation withemployee representatives. We aim for related global savings beyond our targets within our“GP 2020+” program.
In total, our restructuring and optimization programs and the potential further measures
outlined above aim at annual global gross cost savings of around €700 million by the fiscal year
2021 and are expected to exceed the originally targeted annual global gross cost savings for thefiscal year 2023 of around €1 billion by at least €300 million, compared to the fiscal year 2018.
On the basis of these programs and measures, we target additional annual global gross costsavings in the low triple digit euro million range by the fiscal year 2025. We believe that therestructuring costs associated therewith will amount cumulatively to a mid to high triple digiteuro million amount for the fiscal years 2020 to 2023. Furthermore, at the time the evaluationprocess with respect to the potential restructuring and optimization measures outlined abovecrystalizes further, potentially already in the near future, this may lead to additionalrestructuring and optimization measures associated with significantly higher expenses andpotentially savings in excess of our current minimum target for the global savings.
9.4.10.2 Restructuring and Integration Measures in our SGRE Segment
After the merger that led to the formation of SGRE S.A. (“ 9.4.8.1 Merger of Gamesa and Siemens
Wind Power into SGRE and Acquisition of Iberdrola’s 8.1% Shareholding in SGRE ”), SGRE
announced its “L3AD2020” strategic plan for the fiscal years 2018 to 2020. “L3AD2020” is, amongothers, aimed at simplifying the product portfolio and included costs saving targets focused onprocurement, technology and industrial footprint enhancements, as well as acceleration of thetargeted synergies within SGRE from the merger and related reorganizations. The program isexpected to achieve a combined effect of productivity enhancements of more than €2 billion
and significant working capital improvements by the end of the fiscal year 2020 as compared tothe fiscal year 2017. Under the umbrella of “L3AD2020”, among others, the followingrestructuring measures were initiated:
 In November 2017, SGRE announced a global restructuring plan targeting significant
headcount reductions in 31 countries, mainly Spain, Denmark, the U.S. and the U.K.
 In April and October 2018, SGRE signed restructuring agreements that mainly affect
manufacturing locations in Germany.
 In October 2019, the SGRE segment initiated restructuring measures relating to rotor blade and
turbine manufacturing in Denmark as part of the implementation of the “one segment, onetechnology strategy”. This measure was taken due to a challenging market environment and ahighly competitive landscape characterized by price pressures affecting the production ofdirect drive onshore turbines and the onshore blade production.
 Furthermore, in November 2019, SGRE announced a reorganization program. Over a term of
two years, the global white collar staff will be reduced, affecting the wind turbines businessand corporate areas. The implementation approach may vary by country, and shall depend onthe final discussions with employee representatives. So far, the process has been carried outaccording to SGRE’s plans.
 In the first half of 2020, SGRE initiated a restructuring of its Indian operations to take account
of the slower-than-expected recovery of the Indian wind market and in order to adapt to newmarket prospects and dynamics.
 In June 2020, SGRE decided to close the blade factory in Aoiz, Spain, due to competitiveness
considerations.
132
Furthermore, in our SGRE segment, we evaluate the implementation of further potential
restructuring and optimization programs. Within its new “LEAP” program, our SGRE segmentplans to maintain focus on productivity and asset management and also in operationalexcellence. As part of that, our SGRE segment will be constantly analyzing footprint optimizationmeasures and also fixed costs, including selling and general administrative expenses, amongothers, need to be optimized to reach target profitability levels. For example, our SGRE segmenthas recently announced a turnaround plan for its onshore business including the above-mentioned restructuring plan in India, which will have an impact in the upcoming fiscal years. Inaddition, our SGRE segment is still investing in integration activities out of the merger that led tothe formation of SGRE S.A. in fields such as closeout of post-merger IT related projects or inintegration of acquired European Senvion assets (see “ 9.4.8.4 Acquisition of Senvion Group
Assets ”), among others. We expect to incur integration and restructuring costs in the fiscal years
2021 to 2023 of up to a mid triple digit million euro amount, the majority of these costs areexpected to be attributable to restructuring measures. A substantial portion of both integrationand restructuring costs are expected to be incurred by the end of the fiscal year 2022. Althoughmost of the impact is cash related, there are also non-cash elements.
9.4.10.3 Special Items
In connection with the current and ongoing programs and other measures outlined under
“9.4.10.1 Restructuring and Integration Measures in our Gas and Power Segment ” and
“9.4.10.2 Restructuring and Integration Measures in our SGRE Segment ”, we incurred
restructuring and integration costs, affecting our results of operations.
Furthermore, our results in the fiscal year 2020 and in the future are/will be impacted to a certain
extent by stand-alone costs regarding the preparation of our separation from Siemens Group andthe formation of Siemens Energy as an independent enterprise. In addition, major assetimpairments and write-downs related to Siemens Energy Group strategic portfolio decisionsimpacted our result in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020.
Together, these items are referred to as “Special Items” (see “ 4.7.4 Certain Definitions ”). The
following table shows Special Items incurred in the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, as well as inthe nine-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019:

1)Restructuring costs refer to personnel measures leading to severance charges mainly for the Gas and Power segment and
integration costs refer to the SGRE segment only and are related mainly to the merger of Gamesa and Siemens Wind Powerinto SGRE S.A. (see “ 9.4.8.1 Merger of Gamesa and Siemens Wind Power into SGRE and Acquisition of Iberdrola’s 8.1%
Shareholding in SGRE ”) and, to a lesser extent, to the acquisition of assets from Senvion (see “ 9.4.8.4 Acquisition of Senvion
Group Assets ”). In the SGRE segment, restructuring costs amounted to €32 million, €86 million and nil in the fiscal years
2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and to €41 million and €25 million in the nine-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and
2019, respectively. Integration costs in the SGRE segment amounted to €109 million, €90 million and €103 million in the
fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and to €116 million and €65 million in the nine-month periods ended June 30,
2020 and 2019, respectively.
2)Stand-alone costs in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 relate to the carve-out and spin-off of Siemens Energy andinclude, amongst others, costs for IT applications, external service providers, costs related to the listing, and personnel relatedcosts, which will be incurred for retention and accelerated vesting of share-based compensation.
3)Since Siemens has agreed to assume a portion of the total stand-alone costs, the amount for the nine-month period endedJune 30, 2020 in the table above represents the share of costs borne by Siemens Energy only.
4)Included are impairments on intellectual property rights in relation to intangible assets acquired in business combinations of€476 million and write-downs of inventory of €225 million, both related to certain small gas turbine platforms due to a
change in addressing segments of the industrial application market, being associated with the divisions Industrial Applicationsand Generation.
5)The amount for the fiscal year 2019 relates to impairments and write-downs of assets as a consequence of management’sdecision to streamline SGRE’s platform portfolio. In the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, with regard to arestructuring plan aimed at resizing and modifying the scope of business undertaken in India, included are inventory andfixed assets write-downs of €113 million (including inventory write-downs of €102 million and an impairment of property,
plant and equipment of €11 million) as well as an impairment of intangible assets in the amount of €82 million.
6)Restructuring costs for Real Estate Services are included.
9.4.11 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
Due to the global scale of our business and the high level of regionalization of many of our
businesses, our results of operations are affected to a significant extent by foreign currencyexchange rate movements. There are transactional risks which arise when we and our subsidiariesexecute transactions in a currency other than our or our subsidiary’s respective functionalcurrency. The largest project execution, engineering, production and R&D hubs for our businessare located in Germany, the U.S., the United Kingdom, Spain, Denmark and China while our salesare global. This means that while revenue is generated in various currencies, costs are mainly ineuro, U.S. dollar, British Pound, Danish Krone and Renminbi.
Foreign currency exposure is partly balanced by the purchase of goods, commodities and services
in the respective currencies as well as production and other contributions along the value chainin local markets. We seek to manage transaction exposure resulting from contractualcommitments as well as planned transactions in foreign currencies so that at least 75% but nomore than 100% of the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged. If applicable, for such hedgingtransactions, hedge accounting is used to reduce earnings volatility. However, changes incurrency exchange rates cannot generally be predicted and cannot always be hedged oneconomically reasonable terms, and there can be no assurance that our hedging and other riskmitigation strategies will always be successful in mitigating currency risks. If we are unable tomatch sales revenue generated in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, ourresults of operations may be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. In case ofunfavorable exchange rate fluctuations, we may be able to offer our products only atcomparatively higher prices or lower profit margins. This currency-related competitivedisadvantage can lead to a decline in revenue or a lower profit margin at Siemens Energy.
We are also subject to translation exposure because we present our Combined Financial
Statements in euro, but many of the Company’s subsidiaries are located outside the Eurozone. Asa result, in the preparation of our Combined Financial Statements, we must translate assets,liabilities, revenue and costs of all of our operations with a functional currency other than theeuro into euro. Consequently, fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates mayincrease or decrease the euro value of our non-euro assets, liabilities, revenue and costs, even iftheir value has not changed in their local functional currency. We assume that investments innon-euro operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous. Effects from foreigncurrency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amounts into euro arereflected in our Combined Statements of Changes in Invested Equity.
134
9.4.12 Taxation
Taxation can have a significant impact on our results of operations. In Germany, our current tax is
calculated based on a combined tax rate of 31%, consisting of a corporate tax rate of 15%, asolidarity surcharge thereon of 5.5% and an average trade tax rate of 15%. For our foreignsubsidiaries, current taxes are calculated based on local tax laws and applicable tax rates inindividual countries. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into lawand included, among other measures, a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, deferred tax assets andliabilities were re-evaluated and we recognized deferred tax benefits in profit or loss of€264 million in the fiscal year 2018, leading to an income tax gain. In the fiscal years ended
September 30, 2019 and 2017, our effective income tax rates (calculated as income tax expensesdivided by income before income taxes, each as presented in the Audited Combined FinancialStatements) were 11.0% and 26.7%, respectively. In the medium term and assuming nosignificant changes in existing tax rules, we expect an effective income tax rate in a range of 25%to 30%.
9.5 Key Factors Affecting Comparability
The application of new accounting standards and changes in accounting policies limit thecomparability of the Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations for theperiods presented in this Prospectus.
IFRS 9 – “Financial Instruments” was adopted as of October 1, 2018 but did not have a material
effect on our financial position. For more information on the effects of the adoption of IFRS 9 –“Financial Instruments”, see Note 2 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements.
As of October 1, 2019, Siemens Energy retrospectively adopted IFRIC 23 – “Uncertainty over
Income Tax Treatments”, which did not have a material effect on the Group’s financial position,performance or cash flows and is not expected to have any such effect in the future. For moreinformation on the application of IFRIC 23 – “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”, seeNote 1 to the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements.
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 – “Leases” (“ IFRS 16 ”). IFRS 16 eliminates the current
classification model for lessee’s lease contracts as either operating or finance leases and, instead,introduces a single lessee accounting model requiring lessees to recognize right-of-use assets andlease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months. This brings the previousoff-balance leases on the balance sheet in a manner largely comparable to current finance leaseaccounting. IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. SiemensEnergy adopted IFRS 16 by applying the modified retrospective approach (using practical andtransition-related expedients), i.e., comparative figures for the preceding year are not adjusted.
IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model requiring lessees to recognize right-of-useassets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months, unless theunderlying asset is of low value. As of September 30, 2019, finance leases totaled €39 million
(thereof Gas and Power segment: €37 million; SGRE segment €2 million). As of June 30, 2020,
lease liabilities amounted to €1,204 million (October 1, 2019: €896 million), thereof Gas and
Power segment €598 million (October 1, 2019: €311 million) and Siemens Gamesa Renewable
Energy €606 million (October 1, 2019: €585 million).
As of October 1, 2019, right-of-use assets of €1,003 million were recognized in property, plant
and equipment, generally measured at the amount of the lease liability (in total €896 million)
adjusted by any prepaid or accrued lease payments. Most of the transition effect relates to realestate leased by Siemens Energy. The difference between future payment obligations underoperating leases as of September 30, 2019 of €1,559 million and the gross lease liability as of
October 1, 2019 of €1,045 million mostly results from the application of transition-related
expedients. For leases between Siemens Real Estate and Siemens Energy that were to betransferred during the fiscal year 2020, no right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recognizedprior to the transfer.
135
The future lease payments from leases under the right-of-use model as of October 1, 2019 were
discounted using incremental borrowing rates (weighted average incremental borrowing rate asof October 1, 2019: 1.7%).
In addition, beginning with the fiscal year 2020, straight-line operating lease expenses were
replaced by depreciation expenses on right-of-use assets and interest expenses on lease liabilitiesresulting in an increase of EBITDA. With regard to the Adjusted (Net Cash) / Net Debt to EBITDARatio, the positive effect on EBITDA is more than offset by the increase in Adjusted (Net Cash) /Net Debt, resulting ceteris paribus in an increasing ratio. Furthermore, applying IFRS 16 resulted
in a deterioration in cash flows from financing activities, an improvement in cash flows fromoperating activities and, accordingly, ceteris paribus an increase in Free Cash Flow.
9.6 Definition and Discussion of Certain Financial Measures
Certain individual line items in the Combined Statements of Income of Siemens Energy prepared
in accordance with IFRS are described below.
Revenue – Siemens Energy recognizes revenue, when or as control over distinct goods or services
is transferred to the customer, i.e., when the customer is able to direct the use of the transferred
goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits, provided a contract withenforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration isprobable taking into account customer’s creditworthiness. Revenue is the transaction priceSiemens Energy expects to be entitled to. Variable consideration is included in the transactionprice if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur once associateduncertainties are resolved. The amount of variable consideration is calculated by either using theexpected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to better predict theamount of variable consideration. Consideration is adjusted for the time value of money if theperiod between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelvemonths and there is a significant financing benefit either to the customer or Siemens Energy. If acontract contains more than one distinct good or service, the transaction price is allocated toeach performance obligation based on relative stand-alone selling prices. If stand-alone sellingprices are not observable, Siemens Energy reasonably estimates those. Revenue is recognized foreach performance obligation either at a point in time or over time.
For sales from construction-type contracts, revenues are recognized over time under the
percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred to date comparedto total estimated costs. An expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expenseimmediately. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to thecontractual terms.
The percentage-of-completion method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of
the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveriesand services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. These significant estimatesinclude total estimated costs, total estimated revenues, contract risks, including technical,political and regulatory risks, and other judgments. Under the percentage-of-completionmethod, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. In addition,Siemens Energy needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it isterminated. In determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected tobe the most likely scenario, all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract areconsidered on an individual basis.
Revenues from services are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the performance
pattern is other than straight-line, as services are provided, i.e., under the
percentage-of-completion method as described above. Payment terms are usually 30 days fromthe date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.
For the sale of goods, revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods
passes to the buyer, usually upon delivery of the goods. Invoices are issued at that point in timeand are usually payable within 30 days.
136
Cost of sales – Our cost of sales mainly includes costs relating to manufacturing of products,
inventories sold as well as services rendered and consist of variable costs, fixed costs anddepreciation and amortization relating primarily to our property, plant and equipment,internally developed intangible assets and other related costs. Our variable cost of sales primarilyconsists of material, labor, freight and cost of services purchased. Our fixed cost of sales primarilyconsist of manufacturing overheads, salaries, maintenance costs, depreciation of property, plantand equipment and rental and related overhead costs.
Gross profit – Gross profit is calculated as revenue less cost of sales.
Research and development expenses – Costs of research activities are expensed as incurred. Costs
of development activities are capitalized when the recognition criteria in IAS 38 are met.Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairmentlosses with an amortization period of generally three to ten years.
Selling and general administrative expenses – Selling expenses are expenses that do not increase
the value of manufactured products and services but that are necessary to support and ensurethe sales of these products and services. Those expenses primarily consist of salaries paid to oursales employees, sales commissions paid to our sales employees or third parties, marketing andadvertising costs, bad debt expense and depreciation relating to office equipment, software andsimilar assets. General administrative expenses include headquarter functions which are notallocable to other functions and primarily consist of lease expenses, salaries paid to seniormanagement, headquarters and other administrative staff as well as ordinary course expensespayable in respect of auditing, tax, legal and other consulting services in connection with theday-to-day operation of our business.
Other operating income and other operating expenses – represents other operating income,
which includes, among others, gains from the sale of businesses and disposal of assets, and otheroperating expenses, which includes losses on disposal of assets, transaction costs and effects fromlegal and regulatory matters.
Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net – This item is used to
recognize the share of profit or loss in associated companies or joint ventures accounted forusing the equity method. Other income realized and other expense incurred in connection withinvestments accounted for using the equity method, such as gains and losses on the disposal ofsuch investments, transaction costs and impairments are also recognized under this item.
Financial result – represents the balance of (i) interest income, (ii) interest expenses, and
(iii) other financial income (expenses), net. Therein included are income or expenses for financingpurposes, which primarily consist of interest expense on borrowings from Siemens Group (mainlyincluded in interest expenses) as well as interest income and expenses on pension-related assetsand liabilities, and income or expenses related to operating business (interest income related toreceivables from customers, from cash allocated to the segments, interest expenses on payablesto suppliers).
Income tax expenses – Tax positions under respective local tax laws and tax authorities’ views can
be complex and subject to different interpretations of tax payers and local tax authorities.Different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other taxlegislative procedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken intoaccount based on management’s considerations. Under the liability method, deferred tax assetsand liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between thefinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective taxbases. Deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable profit is available, includingincome from forecasted operating earnings, the reversal of existing taxable temporarydifferences and established tax planning opportunities. As of each period-end, Siemens Energyevaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets, generally based on five-years projected futuretaxable profits. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for futuretaxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, Siemens Energybelieves it is probable Siemens Energy will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. As
137
future developments are uncertain and partly beyond Siemens Energy’s control, assumptions are
necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in which deferred tax assets willrecover. Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise theassumption. Particularly for the purposes of the Combined Financial Statements, in accordancewith IAS 12 – “Income Taxes”, income taxes are determined using the separate tax returnapproach under the assumption that the entities and operations of Siemens Energy constituteseparate taxable entities. This assumption implies that current and deferred taxes for allcompanies and operations and tax groups within Siemens Energy are calculated separately. Therecoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed on this basis. In the Combined FinancialStatements, deferred tax assets were recognized to the extent it is probable that they can beoffset with future taxable income from the respective Siemens Energy entities. Tax receivablesand liabilities as well as deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards of Siemens Energy entities andoperations that did not constitute a separate tax payer in previous periods were treated ascontributions or transfers from reserves by shareholders, and are not included in the CombinedFinancial Statements of Siemens Energy. Management deems the approach as appropriatethough not necessarily indicative of the tax expenses or income that would result for SiemensEnergy as a separate group. For further details please also refer to Note 6 of our AuditedCombined Financial Statements.

9.7.2.1 Orders
During the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, Order intake of certain businesses of
Siemens Energy was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as by the oil price development(“9.4.2.2 Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Oil Price Drop in Early 2020 ”). In the nine-
month period ended June 30, 2020, Orders amounted to €27,014 million, up by €2,444 million
or 9.9%, from €24,570 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2019. This increase was
attributable to the SGRE segment, where Orders were substantially up, driven by sharplyincreased service and offshore Orders, including a higher volume from large Orders. In the Gasand Power segment, Orders slightly decreased. Total Segments’ Orders from service clearlyincreased in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 to €9,308 million, up by €631 million,
or 7.3%, from €8,677 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2019. This led to a share of
34.4% of Total Segments’ Orders, slightly below the level of 35.1% in the nine-month periodended June 30, 2019.
Based on such Order intake, Siemens Energy reached a Book-to-Bill Ratio in the nine-month
period ended June 30, 2020 of 1.4, as revenue moderately declined compared to clearly increasedOrders. Siemens Energy’s Order Backlog was €82 billion as of June 30, 2020.

Gas and Power segment – Orders of the Gas and Power segment decreased slightly from
€15,075 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 by €178 million or 1.2%, to
€14,897 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020. The divisions Transmission and
Generation both recorded a moderate increase, including several large Orders in particular in theGeneration division and despite noticeable effects from COVID-19 due to project shifts andcancellations of scheduled Orders in the Transmission division. The Industrial Applicationsdivision, being affected by COVID-19 and the oil price development the most, posted a significantdecrease of Orders, mainly caused by the pandemic, with related Order shifts, especially in theservice business, and to a minor extent also caused by cancelations. Furthermore, Orders of theIndustrial Applications division in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 included a lowervolume from large Orders when compared with the same period of the fiscal year 2019. Overall,the development of Orders on the reportable segment level was stabilized by clear growth of thenew unit businesses of Generation and Transmission. The Gas and Power segment’s service Ordersclearly decreased in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 to €5,944 million by
140
€697 million, or 10.5%, from €6,641 million in the same period of the preceding fiscal year,
which also was mainly attributable to a significant decrease of Orders in the IndustrialApplications division. This led to a service share of 39.9% of the segment’s total Orders in thenine-month period ended June 30, 2020, clearly below the level of the same period of thepreceding fiscal year.
Orders in the EMEA region increased slightly, since, among others, the Gas and Power segment’s
Generation division recorded an Order for a turnkey CCPP of €0.4 billion including service in
Germany and successful bid for a turnkey construction project of a CCPP with a volume of morethan€0.2 billion in Russia. Moreover, the Transmission division was awarded Orders for
substations worth €0.2 billion in Iraq as well as the first lot of about €0.2 billion for a large
HVDC converter project in Germany. The Industrial Applications division closed a contract for agas-storage solution in Saudi Arabia in a volume of about €0.1 billion. The region Asia, Australia
was the only region showing significant growth during the nine-month period ended June 30,2020, among others mainly due to a number of large Orders for the Generation division,including two Orders in the Republic of Korea totaling more than €0.3 billion and an Order of
about €0.2 billion for its service business in Taiwan. Thus, Order intake in the Asia, Australia
region partially compensated the development in the Americas region which posted a significantdecline despite significant growth in the United States. In the Americas region, the IndustrialApplications division in the prior year period recorded a higher volume from large Orders inBrazil and further smaller projects in Canada.
Based on such Order intake, the Gas and Power segment reached a Book-to-Bill Ratio in the nine-
month period ended June 30, 2020 of 1.1. The Order Backlog was €51 billion as of June 30, 2020.
SGRE segment – Orders of the SGRE segment increased from €9,674 million in the nine-month
period ended June 30, 2019 by €2,498 million, or 25.8%, to €12,172 million in the nine-month
period ended June 30, 2020. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see “ 9.4.2.2 Effects of the
COVID-19 Pandemic and the Oil Price Drop in Early 2020 ”) mainly affected the onshore market.
The substantial increase in Orders was mainly due to a higher volume from large Orders, withOrder intake for offshore wind power plant projects including service in Taiwan, the UnitedKingdom, the Netherlands, France and Germany. Despite a large Order in Brazil and the UnitedStates, Order volume for onshore projects was significantly below the prior year level, overallreflecting the impact of COVID-19. Among others, this was attributable to delayed contractsignings in all three reporting regions, though mainly in the U.S. as well as in India, where themarket generally slowed down. Overall, on a geographical basis, Orders sharply rose in the EMEAregion, while the Asia, Australia region (mainly due to a sharp decline in China) and the Americasregion showed a substantial decline. Service Orders increased by €1,328 million, or 65.2%, to
€3,364 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, up from €2,036 million in the
same period of the fiscal year 2019. The sharp growth mainly resulted from portfolio additions ofacquired Senvion assets and also included the first contracts for Senvion technology outside thescope of the acquisition of Senvion assets (see “ 9.4.8.4 Acquisition of Senvion Group Assets ”),
namely two multi-year maintenance contracts for wind power plants in Australia, as well asmaintenance contracts for two offshore projects in France. This led to a service share of 27.6% ofthe segment’s total Orders, substantially above 21.0% in the nine-month period ended June 30,2019.
Based on such Order intake, the SGRE segment reached a Book-to-Bill Ratio in the nine-month
period ended June 30, 2020 of 1.8. As of June 30, 2020, the Order Backlog was €32 billion,
benefitting from the acquisition of Senvion assets (see “ 9.4.8.4 Acquisition of Senvion Group
Assets ”). Following the integration of service assets acquired from Senvion in January 2020,
service accounted for 46.9% of the Order Backlog of the SGRE segment.

9.7.2.2 Revenue
During the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, revenue development of Siemens Energy
was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (see “ 9.4.2.2 Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the
Oil Price Drop in Early 2020 ”). In the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, Siemens Energy
recognized revenue of €19,828 million. This was €675 million, or 3.3%, lower than in the same
period in the fiscal year 2019, in which revenue amounted to €20,503 million. The decrease was
driven by the SGRE segment, while revenue in the Gas and Power segment was stable period-over-period. Total segments’ revenue from service was nearly stable in the nine-month periodended June 30, 2020 to €6,778 million compared to €6,838 million in the same period of the
fiscal year 2019. This led to a share of 34.0% of Total Segments’ total revenue, slightly above thelevel of the same period in the fiscal year 2019 of 33.2% (see also “ 9.4.5.2 Recurring Profitable
Revenue From Our Service Business ”).

Gas and Power segment – Total revenue of the Gas and Power segment in the nine-month period
ended June 30, 2020 amounted to €13,326 million, nearly level with €13,315 million in the
same period of the fiscal year 2019. In a continuously disruptive and challenging marketenvironment (see “ 9.4.1.1 Trends Impacting the Gas and Power Segment ”), the COVID-19
pandemic posed an additional considerable impact on the Gas and Power segment’s revenuedevelopment (see “ 9.4.2.2 Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Oil Price Drop in Early
2020 ”) and impacted all divisions. The Industrial Applications division saw, despite COVID-19
effects, a moderate revenue increase mainly due to a strong product business driven by the Orderintake of the fiscal year 2019. Revenue from the division’s service business remained stable onprior year’s level. The Generation division’s revenue slightly declined from the level of the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019, also impacted by COVID-19. The highest influence from thepandemic was seen in the Transmission division due to delays or shifts of projects as well aslockdowns or quarantines in factories, despite that, the Transmission division’s revenue couldlevel with the prior year period. The Gas and Power segment’s service revenue slightly decreasedin the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 by €119 million, or 2.1%, to €5,552 million from
€5,671 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2019. This led to a service share of 41.7% of
the Gas and Power segment’s total revenue in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020,slightly below the level of 42.6% the same period of the preceding fiscal year.
SGRE segment – Total revenue of the SGRE segment decreased from €7,283 million in the nine-
month period ended June 30, 2019 by €668 million, or 9.2% to €6,615 million in the same
period of the fiscal year 2020. Revenue development was considerably affected by the COVID-19pandemic (see “ 9.4.2.2 Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Oil Price Drop in Early 2020 ”),
mainly in the onshore market. The overall decrease reflected a decline of revenue from both theonshore and the offshore business, which was partly offset by growth of service revenue. Whilethe substantial decrease in revenue from the offshore business was in line with project executionplanning, the reduction of onshore revenue was due to delays in the execution of certain projectsin Northern Europe and the continuous slowdown in the Indian market, both exacerbated by theCOVID-19 pandemic as well as due to trends in the prices of executed contracts, less volume of
143
installation work and the geographical mix of revenue with a substantially lower contribution
from the EMEA region. Overall, on a geographical basis, the substantial decrease in the EMEAregion was only in part offset by substantial growth in the Americas region and a moderateincrease in the Asia, Australia region. The SGRE segment’s service revenue moderately increasedin the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 to €1,226 million, up by €59 million, or 5.1%,
from€1,167 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2019. Growth was driven by the
acquisition of the service assets from Senvion in January 2020 (see “ 9.4.8.4 Acquisition of Senvion
Group Assets ”) and by organic growth in maintenance revenue and spare part sales, offset by a
reduction in the sale of value-added solutions. This led to a service share of 18.5% of the SGREsegment’s total revenue in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, significantly above thelevel of 16.0% the same period of the fiscal year 2019.

In the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, revenue in the EMEA region amounted to
€10,053 million, corresponding to a share of 50.7% of revenue of Siemens Energy. Revenue in
this region was down from €11,256 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 by
€1,203 million or 10.7%. A substantial decrease of revenue of the SGRE segment due to the
reasons mentioned above, was slowed by a slight increase in revenue of the Gas and Powersegment, with Germany balancing a negative development in other countries of the region.
Revenue in the Americas amounted to €6,247 million in the nine-month period ended June 30,
2020, corresponding to a share of 31.5% of revenue of Siemens Energy, up by €318 million, or
5.4%, from €5,929 million in the same period of the preceding fiscal year. The increase was
driven by substantially higher revenue in the SGRE segment, as the U.S. were the main source forrevenue from the onshore business, which more than offset a moderate decline of revenue in theGas and Power segment.
In the Asia, Australia region, revenues amounted to €3,528 million in the nine-month period
ended June 30, 2020, corresponding to a share of 17.8% of revenue of Siemens Energy, up by€210 million, or 6.3%, from €3,318 million in the same period of the preceding fiscal year.
Revenue moderately increased in the SGRE segment and clearly in the Gas and Power segment,including revenue driven by a technology collaboration in the field of heavy duty gas turbines inChina.
9.7.2.3 Cost of Sales
Cost of sales increased from €17,420 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 by
€944 million, or 5.4%, to €18,364 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020. The
moderate increase was due to noticeable impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (see “ 9.4.2.2 Effects
of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Oil Price Drop in Early 2020 ”), overall reflecting less fixed cost
absorption related to reduced capacity utilization caused by temporary disruptions in the supplychain and plant closures, as well as project delays and claims for damages from customers, as well
144
as due to asset impairments and write-downs. The Gas and Power segment’s cost of sales did not
reflect the stable revenue pattern, but increased clearly compared to the prior year period, dueto inventory write-downs in the amount of €225 million, in part associated with impairments of
intellectual property rights in relation to intangible assets acquired in business combinations inthe amount of €318 million (see “ 9.7.2.13 Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA before Special
Items ”), negative effects from project suspension and termination as well as a more unfavorable
product mix. Moderately increased cost of sales in the SGRE segment mainly resulted fromnegative effects from project execution (especially in Northern Europe and India), which wereexacerbated by COVID-19, combined with sharply higher integration costs as well as impacts fromstrategic portfolio decisions, mainly related to the resizing and restructuring plan for the Indianbusiness and a plant closure in Spain. Amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations included in cost of sales amounted to €188 million and €185 million in the nine-
month period ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
9.7.2.4 Gross profit
Gross profit sharply decreased from €3,084 million in the nine-month period ended June 30,
2019 by €1,621 million, or 52.6%, to €1,463 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020,
reflecting decreased revenue and increased cost of sales at the same time during the nine-monthperiod ended June 30, 2020. The overall gross profit deterioration was primarily attributable tothe SGRE segment posting a negative swing in gross profit. Also, the Gas and Power segmentshowed a substantially decreased gross profit due to, amongst others, cost of sales includingmajor non-recurring charges. The gross profit margin (calculated as the ratio of gross profit torevenue) of Siemens Energy for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 of 7.4% decreasedsharply, compared to 15.0% in the same period of the fiscal year 2019.
9.7.2.5 Research and development expenses
Despite a decline in revenue, research and development expenses of €689 million in the nine-
month period ended June 30, 2020 were nearly level with €683 million in the same period of the
fiscal year 2019. Implemented cost out measures of the Gas and Power segment taking effectwith a moderate decrease of its research and development expense, which was more than offsetby an increase in the SGRE segment. Amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations included in research and development expenses amounted to €5 million and
€5 million in the nine-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
9.7.2.6 Selling and general administrative expenses
Selling and general administrative expenses increased from €1,945 million in the nine-month
period ended June 30, 2019 by €378 million, or 19.4%, to €2,323 million in the same period of
the fiscal year 2020. Both segments showed a considerable increase in selling and generaladministrative expenses, with the major part being caused by impairments of intellectualproperty rights in relation to intangible assets acquired in business combinations in the amountof€170 million in the Gas and Power segment (“ 9.7.2.13 Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA
before Special Items ”) as well as to the set-up of corporate functions in preparation for the
Spin-Off and Listing of Siemens Energy. Furthermore, included in selling expenses in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 were royalties in an amount of €40 million for the usage of
the combined designation “Siemens Energy” and the “SIEMENS Energy” trademark (see“18.1.1.1.4 Trademark and Name Use (Sub-)License Agreement with Siemens Energy ”), such
expenses had no relevance in past fiscal years. The SGRE segment posted expenses of €82 million
resulting from impairments of intangible assets as a consequence of its adaption of the Indianbusiness model (see “ 9.7.2.13 Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA before Special Items ”).
Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations included in selling andgeneral administrative expenses amounted to €170 million and €189 million in the nine-month
periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
145
9.7.2.7 Other operating income (expenses), net
Other operating income (expenses), net decreased from net expenses of €38 million in the nine-
month period ended June 30, 2019 by €27 million to net expenses of €11 million in the same
period of the fiscal year 2020. While the prior year period included a loss of €54 million from the
sale of a site for packaging and service of rotating equipment in Hengelo, Netherlands, of theIndustrial Applications division in the Gas and Power segment, in the nine-month period endedJune 30, 2020 sharply lower Carve-out related expenses were incurred. The overall developmentwas reflected in other operating income of €41 million in the nine-month period ended June 30,
2019 compared to €66 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020, while other operating
expenses remained nearly stable and amounted to €77 million in the nine-month period ended
June 30, 2020 compared to €79 million in the same period of fiscal year 2019.
9.7.2.8 Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net
Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net decreased from an
income of €90 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 by €84 million to an
income of €6 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020. The decline is due to a decreased
share of profit (loss), net in at-equity investments and lower gains on sales of investments. Thenine-month period ended June 30, 2019 included a €55 million gain from the partial sale of an
at-equity investment presented in the Gas and Power segment’s Transmission division.
9.7.2.9 Financial result
Negative financial result decreased from €238 million in the nine-month period ended June 30,
2019 by €119 million, or 50.0%, to €119 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020.
Interest income decreased from €76 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 by
€46 million, or 60.5%, to €30 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020. This decline
mainly reflects reduced interest income from financing transactions with Siemens Group. Interestexpenses decreased from €290 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 by
€156 million, or 53.8%, to €134 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020, mainly due to
lower interest expenses, driven by the final termination and repayment of the last outstandingloan of USD-denominated loans granted by Siemens to Siemens Energy’s subsidiary Dresser-RandGroup Inc. to finance the acquisition of Dresser-Rand in May 2015 (the “ Dresser-Rand Loans ”),
which occurred in February 2020. Other financial income (expenses), net decreased from expensesof€23 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 by €7 million to expenses of
€16 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020.
9.7.2.10 Income (loss) before income taxes
Income before income taxes decreased from €270 million in the nine-month period ended
June 30, 2019 by €1,942 million to a loss before income taxes of €1,672 million in the same
period of fiscal year 2020. While the total of financial result and depreciation and amortizationwas broadly stable compared to the same period of fiscal year 2019, the development of incomebefore income taxes was primarily determined by the patterns as discussed for Adjusted EBITA(see “ 9.7.2.13 Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA before Special Items ” below).
9.7.2.11 Income tax (expenses) / gains
In the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, income tax gains of €203 million were
recognized, compared to income tax expenses of €67 million in the same period of the fiscal
year 2019. However, the effective tax rate of 12.1% (absolute value) for the nine-month periodended June 30, 2020 was well below 24.8% for the same period in the fiscal year 2019, inparticular because of the non-recognition of deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards.
9.7.2.12 Net income (loss)
As a result of the factors discussed above, net income declined from €202 million in the nine-
month period ended June 30, 2019 by €1,671 million to a net loss of €1,469 million in the same
period of the fiscal year 2020.
146
9.7.2.13 Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA before Special Items
The development of Adjusted EBITA during the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 was
impacted across all businesses by the COVID-19 pandemic while the Gas and Power segment’sIndustrial Applications division in particular was also affected by the oil price development (see“9.4.2.2 Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Oil Price Drop in Early 2020 ”). Adjusted EBITA
of Siemens Energy fell from positive €857 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019
by€2,068 million to a negative €1,211 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020. The
sharp decline in Adjusted EBITA was due to the development in both segments. Besidesconsiderable impacts due to COVID-19 and the oil price development, Gas and Power recordedimpairments on intellectual property rights and in part associated with inventory write-downstotaling €713 million. Furthermore the Gas and Power segment recorded a less favorable mix of
revenue and non-recurring Carve-Out-related expenses. Adjusted EBITA of the SGRE segmentturned negative, mainly due to project delays, the slowdown in the Indian market and COVID-19and sharply higher restructuring and integration costs.
Special Items within Adjusted EBITA of Siemens Energy in the nine-month period ended June 30,
2020 totaled €1,124 million, compared to €137 million in the same period of the fiscal year
2019, leading to an Adjusted EBITA before Special Items of Siemens Energy in the nine-monthperiod ended June 30, 2020 of negative €87 million, compared to positive €994 million in same
period a year earlier. The respective Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 was negative 0.4%, compared to positive 4.8% in the sameperiod of the fiscal year 2019.

Gas and Power segment – Adjusted EBITA of the Gas and Power segment decreased sharply from
positive €506 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 by €1,045 million to
negative €539 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020. The decisive factors were
impairments on intellectual property rights in relation to intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations in part combined with inventory write-downs of €488 million and €225 million,
respectively, both being associated with the divisions Industrial Applications and Generation (seealso “ 9.4.10.3 Special Items ”). The COVID-19 pandemic noticeably impacted the Gas and Power
segment’s result due to project outages or shifts, underabsorption of fixed costs, shut downs ofproduction and customer sites as well as related project charges and cost increases mostly relatedto the divisions Generation and Transmission. A decrease of severance charges was more thanoffset, as Gas and Power recognized additional expenses of €19 million in connection with the
establishment of Siemens Energy as an independent company, which are part of the Special Items(see below). Furthermore, related topics, e.g., royalties for the usage of the combined
designation “Siemens Energy” and the “SIEMENS Energy” trademark (see “ 18.1.1.1.4 Trademark
and Name Use (Sub-)License Agreement with Siemens Energy ”), which had no relevance in past
fiscal years, impacted Adjusted EBITA. Adjusted EBITA of the nine-month period ended June 30,2019 was positively affected by a gain from the partial sale of an at-equity investment in theamount of €55 million, allocated to the Transmission division. Furthermore, the development of
the prior year period was influenced by a more favorable mix of revenues and positive effectsfrom the progress of projects. The Adjusted EBITA Margin for the nine-month period endedJune 30, 2020 turned negative to 4.0% compared to positive 3.8% in the same period of the fiscalyear 2019.
148
Special Items in the Gas and Power segment in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020
totaled €751 million compared to €47 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2019,
leading to Adjusted EBITA before Special Items in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 of€212 million, compared to €553 million in same period a year earlier. The respective Adjusted
EBITA Margin before Special Items in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 was 1.6%,compared to 4.2% in the same period of the fiscal year 2019.
SGRE segment – Adjusted EBITA of the SGRE segment sharply fell to negative €631 million in the
nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, down by €986 million, from positive €355 million in
the same period of fiscal year 2019, including negative COVID-19 effects (see “ 9.4.2.2 Effects of
the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Oil Price Drop in Early 2020 ”) mainly concentrated on the
onshore business. The development of Adjusted EBITA reflects the execution of projects withlower prices from the Order Backlog (onshore, offshore and service), which were offset byimprovements in productivity and fixed costs under the “L3AD2020” program (see“9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items ”). Furthermore,
Adjusted EBITA was impacted by a less favorable business mix, with a lower contribution by theEMEA region in the onshore business, and a lower contribution from the offshore business,mainly due to lower revenue, which was in line with expectations. The service business delivereda significantly increased contribution to Adjusted EBITA period-over-period. The onshore businessfaced project delays in Northern Europe and the slow-down of the Indian market which wasfurther exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in asset write-downsand considerable cost increases, including charges related to two projects of €183 million and
€95 million in Northern Europe and India, respectively. Restructuring and integration costs
sharply increased to €157 million accompanied by impacts of strategic portfolio decisions of
€195 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 (see also “ 9.4.10.3 Special Items ”),
after only restructuring and integration costs of €90 million in the same period a year earlier.
That was related to a plant closure in Spain and, for the most part, to a restructuring plan forIndia, including strategic portfolio decisions, which was launched in the fiscal year 2020, aimed atresizing and modifying the scope of business undertaken in India, in order to adapt the businessmodel to the current market structure and the significantly reduced market outlooks in India.Defined measures resulted in inventory and fixed assets write-downs. In addition, due to thedeterioration of the Indian market, the recoverability of the existing intangible assets has beenanalyzed, and an impairment of intangible assets in the amount of €82 million has been
recognized. The impacts mentioned were partially offset by the positive effect of the litigationsettlement between Areva and Adwen (see “ 12.8.2.1 Settlement Agreement with Areva ”). The
Adjusted EBITA Margin of the SGRE segment for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 wasnegative 9.5% and switched from positive 4.9% in the same period of fiscal year 2019.
Special Items in the SGRE segment in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 totaled
€352 million compared to €90 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2019, leading to
Adjusted EBITA before Special Items in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 of negative€279 million, compared to €445 million in same period a year earlier. The respective Adjusted
EBITA Margin before Special Items in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 was negative4.2%, sharply decreased from positive 6.1% in the same period of the fiscal year 2019.

9.7.3.1 Orders
In the fiscal year 2019, Orders amounted to €33,734 million, up by €2,688 million or 8.7%, from
€31,046 million in the fiscal year 2018. This increase was attributable to a higher volume from
large Orders in both the Gas and Power segment and the SGRE segment. In the Gas and Powersegment, Orders clearly increased in the fiscal year 2019 driven by growth in the new-unitbusiness. Volume from large Orders was up year-over-year. In the SGRE segment, Orders clearlyincreased year-over-year due to an increased volume from large Orders in all businesses. TotalSegments’ Orders from service slightly decreased in the fiscal year 2019 by €146 million, or 1.2%
to€11,630 million from €11,776 million in the fiscal year 2018. This led to a share of 34.3% of
Total Segments’ Orders, clearly below the level of 37.8% in the fiscal year 2018.
Based on such Order intake, Siemens Energy as a whole reached a Book-to-Bill Ratio in the fiscal
year 2019 of 1.2. Siemens Energy’s Order Backlog was €77 billion as of September 30, 2019.

Gas and Power segment – Orders of the Gas and Power segment increased from €19,283 million
in the fiscal year 2018 by €1,904 million, or 9.9%, to €21,187 million in the fiscal year 2019.
While the divisions Transmission and Industrial Applications contributed to this development, theGeneration division posted a moderate decrease. The overall increase on the reportable segmentlevel was driven by the new-unit businesses of all three divisions. Volume from large Ordersincreased while service Orders decreased in the fiscal year 2019 to €8,893 million by
€430 million, or 4.6%, from €9,323 million in the fiscal year 2018. This was mainly due to a
decrease in the Generation division, which recorded higher volume from large service orders inthe EMEA region and the Americas in the fiscal year 2018. This led to a service share of 42.0% ofthe segment’s total Orders, significantly below the level of the fiscal year 2018.
Orders in the EMEA region decreased significantly, despite, among others, the Gas and Power
segment’s Generation division successful bid for a large contract of about €0.4 billion for a CCPP
including service in France in the fiscal year 2019. Moreover the Transmission division wasawarded a HVDC order worth about €0.4 billion in Germany as well as an Order of about
€0.3 billion for a large offshore grid connection project in the United Kingdom, both being
postponed from the prior year. Furthermore, the Generation division secured an order of about€0.3 billion for its solution business in Brazil. The Industrial Applications division also recorded
large Orders related to the product business and other power plants operated for externalcustomers in Brazil and further smaller projects in Canada and the United States, all supportingthe substantial growth in the Americas.
Based on such Order intake, the Gas and Power segment reached a Book-to-Bill Ratio in the fiscal
year 2019 of 1.1. The Order Backlog was €52 billion as of September 30, 2019.
SGRE segment – Orders of the SGRE segment increased from €11,875 million in the fiscal year
2018 by €874 million, or 7.4%, to €12,749 million in the fiscal year 2019. Effects from
acquisitions and disposals as well as foreign currency translation effects in total had nearly noeffect on order development. The order growth was driven by all businesses, in particular by a
151
higher volume from large Orders. With service Orders up by €284 million, or 11.6%, service
Orders amounted to €2,737 million in the fiscal year 2019 after €2,453 million in the fiscal year
2018. Growth was driven by two offshore contracts signed in Taiwan (as described below), bothof which included maintenance. This led to a share of 21.5% of the segment’s total Orders,moderately above 20.7% in the fiscal year 2018.
Sharp order growth in Asia, Australia was supported by the recovery of the Indian onshore
market since June 2019 and included two large Orders for offshore wind power plants includingservice in Taiwan, totaling about €2.3 billion. The SGRE segment also recorded sharply higher
Orders in the Americas region, driven by several large Orders in the onshore business mainly inthe United States, benefitting from the strength of the United States market in the fiscal year2019. In contrast, Orders came in substantially lower in the EMEA region, which in the fiscal year2018 had included an order for an offshore wind power plant, including service, in the UnitedKingdom worth about €1.3 billion.
Based on such Order intake, SGRE reached a Book-to-Bill Ratio in the fiscal year 2019 of 1.2. The
Order Backlog was €26 billion as of September 30, 2019.

9.7.3.2 Revenue
Revenue increased from €28,023 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €774 million, or 2.8%, to
€28,797 million in the fiscal year 2019. The increase was driven by significant revenue growth in
the SGRE segment, with both new unit and service business significantly up. Revenue of the Gasand Power segment slightly decreased compared to the fiscal year 2018. Primarily, revenue of thenew-unit business of the Generation division declined as a result of the weak order intake inprior fiscal years. Total Segments’ revenue from service moderately increased in the fiscal year2019 by €492 million, or 5.4%, to €9,548 million from €9,056 million in the fiscal year 2018.
This led to a share of 33.0% of Total Segments’ total revenue in the fiscal year 2019, slightlyabove the level of 32.2% in the fiscal year 2018.

Gas and Power segment – Total revenue of the Gas and Power segment decreased slightly from
€18,982 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €273 million, or 1.4%, to €18,709 million in the fiscal
year 2019. In a continuing competitive market environment characterized by overcapacities in thegas turbines market and prevailing price pressure (see also “ 9.4.3 Competition ”), the new-unit
businesses recorded lower revenue compared to the fiscal year 2018, following weak order intakein prior years in the Generation and Industrial Applications divisions as well as a lower revenuecontribution from the projects in Egypt. This project mainly impacted the Generation division(see “ 9.4.5.1 Project Business ”), as related revenue in the fiscal year 2019 halved when compared
to the fiscal year 2018. A moderate increase in service revenue, also predominantly driven by theGeneration division, could not offset the overall decline in the segment’s total revenue. On ageographical basis, revenue decreased in the regions EMEA, due to lower contribution from theprojects in Egypt, and Asia, Australia, partly offset by growth in the Americas. The segment Gasand Power’s service revenue moderately increased in the fiscal year 2019 by €302 million, or
4.0%, to €7,931 million from €7,629 million in the fiscal year 2018. This led to a service share of
42.4% of the Gas and Power segment’s total revenue in the fiscal year 2019, moderately abovethe level of 40.2% the fiscal year 2018.
SGRE segment – Total revenue of the SGRE segment increased from €9,122 million in the fiscal
year 2018 by €1,105 million, or 12.1% to €10,227 million in the fiscal year 2019. The revenue
increase included significant growth in the offshore and service businesses and clear growth inthe onshore business. Growth in the offshore business was in line with the activity that had beenplanned for the fiscal year 2019, based on Orders received in past periods. The increase in theonshore business was mainly due to greater installation activity, with EMEA making a largercontribution. On a geographical basis, revenue rose substantially in the EMEA region, while itdeclined clearly in the Americas and Asia, Australia. The SGRE segment’s service revenuesignificantly increased in the fiscal year 2019 to €1,617 million by €190 million, or 13.3%, from
€1,427 million in the fiscal year 2018. Growth was driven by a significant expansion in the sale of
153
maintenance contracts and by the sale of value-added solutions during the fiscal year. This led to
a service share of 15.8% of the SGRE segment’s total revenue in the fiscal year 2019, slightlyabove the level of 15.6% the fiscal year 2018.

In the fiscal year 2019, revenue in the EMEA region amounted to €15,756 million, corresponding
to a share of 54.7% of revenue of Siemens Energy. Revenue in this region was up from€14,881 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €875 million or 5.9%. A decrease of revenue of the
Gas and Power segment due to the projects in Egypt was more than offset by substantial revenuegrowth in the SGRE segment.
Revenue in the Americas amounted to €8,222 million in the fiscal year 2019, corresponding to a
share of 28.6% of revenue of Siemens Energy in the fiscal year 2019, up by €426 million, or
5.5%, from €7,796 million in the fiscal year 2018. The increase was driven by an increase in
revenue in the Gas and Power segment, which more than offset a clear decline of revenue in theSGRE segment. Revenues in Americas were mainly driven by a significant revenue increase in theU.S., which compensated substantial decreases in Canada.
Increases in revenue in the EMEA region and the Americas were partly offset by decreases of
revenue in the Asia, Australia region, which amounted to €4,819 million in the fiscal year 2019,
corresponding to a share of 16.7% of revenue of Siemens Energy in the fiscal year 2019. Revenuein this region declined from €5,346 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €527 million, or 9.9%.
Revenues in Asia, Australia decreased mainly due to a strong decline in Thailand. With regard toChina and Taiwan, the Gas and Power segment’s slight decline and the SGRE segment’ssubstantial decrease of revenue in China were more than compensated by the positivedevelopment of the SGRE segment in Taiwan.
9.7.3.3 Cost of Sales
Cost of sales increased from €23,876 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €739 million, or 3.1%, to
€24,615 million in the fiscal year 2019. In the fiscal year 2019, the SGRE segment posted
significant higher cost of sales mainly due to project mix effects, negative impacts from projectexecution (especially in Northern Europe and India) and a higher impact from restructuring andintegration costs as well as costs related to strategic portfolio decisions. This was partly offset bya slight decrease in cost of sales in the Gas and Power segment compared to the fiscal year 2018.Positive effects from project execution and completion, less project-related quality issues as wellas substantially lower severance charges improved the Generation division’s cost of sales. Inaddition, in the fiscal year 2019, the Generation division could realize sharply higher cost savingsfrom the “PG 2020” program, when compared to the prior fiscal year. The overall positive effectsfrom decreasing costs was limited by severance charges in connection with the “GP2020+”program in the Transmission division (see “ 9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement
Measures; Special Items ”) as well as by reduced capacity utilization. Cost of sales before
154
amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments
amounted to €24,367 million (thereof €15,403 million in the Gas and Power segment,
€9,104 million in the SGRE segment and €(140) million in Reconciliation) and €23,627 million
(thereof €15,695 million in the Gas and Power segment, €8,007 million in the SGRE segment
and€(75) million in Reconciliation) in the fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization
of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments included in costof sales amounted to €248 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €74 million; SGRE
segment: €174 million) and €249 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €79 million; SGRE
segment: €169 million) in the fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Special Items within cost
of sales amounted to €317 million (thereof €187 million in the Gas and Power segment and
€130 million in the SGRE segment) and €399 million (thereof €290 million in the Gas and
Power segment and €109 million in the SGRE segment) in the fiscal years 2019 and 2018,
respectively. Cost of sales before amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations and goodwill impairments and Special Items amounted to €24,050 million (thereof
€15,216 million in the Gas and Power segment and €8,974 million in the SGRE segment and
Reconciliation €(140) million) and €23,228 million (thereof €15,405 million in the Gas and
Power segment and €7,898 million in the SGRE segment and Reconciliation of €(75) million) in
the fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. This resulted in cost of sales before amortization ofintangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments and Special Itemsas a percentage of total revenue of 83.5% (81.3% in the Gas and Power segment and 87.7% inthe SGRE segment) and 82.9% (81.2% in the Gas and Power segment and 86.6% in the SGREsegment) in the fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
9.7.3.4 Gross profit
Gross profit slightly increased from €4,147 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €34 million, or
0.8%, to €4,181 million in the fiscal year 2019, reflecting the slightly higher absolute increase in
revenue when compared with the absolute increase in cost of sales during the fiscal year 2019.Gross profit attributable to the Gas and Power segment slightly increased compared to the fiscalyear 2018. In this segment, lower costs of sales were largely offset by negative effects from lowerrevenue and price declines. Gross profit attributable to the SGRE segment came in slightly aboveprior year levels as higher revenue was mostly offset by price declines and higher cost of sales.The gross profit margin (calculated as the ratio of gross profit to revenue) of Siemens Energy forthe fiscal year 2019 of 14.5% was nearly level with 14.8% in the fiscal year 2018.
9.7.3.5 Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses decreased from €1,069 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€68 million, or 6.4%, to €1,001 million in the fiscal year 2019. A significant decline of research
and development expenses of the Gas and Power segment due to adjustment of capacities tolower volumes in shrinking markets as well as lower severance charges and cost savings due tothe “PG 2020” program was partly offset by increases at the SGRE segment, related to investmentin growth. Research and development expenses before amortization of intangible assets acquiredin business combinations and goodwill impairments amounted to €995 million (thereof
€787 million in the Gas and Power segment, €208 million in the SGRE segment and €(0) million
in Reconciliation) and €1,062 million (thereof €897 million in the Gas and Power segment,
€166 million in the SGRE segment and €(1) million in Reconciliation) in the fiscal years 2019 and
2018, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations andgoodwill impairments included in research and development expenses amounted to €6 million
(thereof Gas and Power segment: €6 million) and €7 million (thereof Gas and Power segment:
€7 million) in the fiscal year 2019 and 2018, respectively. Special Items within research and
development expenses amounted to €42 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €10 million;
SGRE segment: €32 million) and €50 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €32 million;
SGRE segment: €18 million) in the fiscal year 2019 and 2018, respectively. Research and
development expenses before amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations and goodwill impairments and Special Items amounted to €953 million (thereof
155
Gas and Power segment: €777 million; SGRE segment: €176 million; Reconciliation €0 million)
and€1,012 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €865 million; SGRE segment €148 million;
Reconciliation €(1) million) in the fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. This resulted in
research and development expenses before amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations and goodwill impairments and Special Items as a percentage of total revenue of3.3% (4.2% in the Gas and Power segment and 1.7% in the SGRE segment) and 3.6% (4.6% inthe Gas and Power segment and 1.6% in the SGRE segment) in the fiscal years 2019 and 2018,respectively.
9.7.3.6 Selling and general administrative expenses
Selling and general administrative expenses decreased from €2,739 million in the fiscal year
2018 by €92 million, or 3.4%, to €2,647 million in the fiscal year 2019. In the fiscal year 2019,
selling and general administrative expenses were down in both segments compared to the fiscalyear 2018. While the extent of decline in the Gas and Power segment was in line with therevenue development and in part due to lower severance charges, the SGRE segment posted aclear decrease in selling and general administrative expenses, mainly due to improvements inproductivity and fix costs under its “L3AD2020” program (see “ 9.4.10 Integration and
Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items ”). Selling expenses before €152 million of
amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments inthe Gas and Power segment in the fiscal year 2019 amounted to €1,657 million and accounted
for 83.1% of the segment’s selling and general administrative expenses before amortization ofintangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments totaling€1,993 million. Selling and general administrative expenses before amortization of intangible
assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments amounted to €2,402 million
(thereof €1,993 million in the Gas and Power segment, €405 million in the SGRE segment and
€4 million in Reconciliation) and €2,449 million (thereof €2,015 million in the Gas and Power
segment, €426 million in the SGRE segment and Reconciliation of €8 million) in the fiscal years
2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinationsincluded in selling and general administrative expenses amounted to €245 million (thereof Gas
and Power segment: €152 million; SGRE segment: €92 million) and €290 million (thereof Gas
and Power segment: €154 million; SGRE segment: €136 million) in the fiscal years 2019 and
2018, respectively. Special Items within selling and general administrative expenses amounted to€75 million (thereof €50 million in the Gas and Power segment and €25 million in the SGRE
segment) and €96 million (thereof €53 million in the Gas and Power segment and €43 million
in the SGRE segment) in the fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Selling and generaladministrative expenses before amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations and goodwill impairments and Special Items amounted to €2,327 million (thereof
€1,943 million in the Gas and Power segment; €380 million in the SGRE segment; Reconciliation
€4 million) and €2,353 million (thereof €1,962 million in the Gas and Power segment;
€383 million in the SGRE segment; Reconciliation €
8 million) in the fiscal years 2019 and 2018,
respectively. This resulted in selling and general administrative expenses before amortization ofintangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments and before SpecialItems as a percentage of total revenue of 8.1% (10.4% in the Gas and Power segment and 3.7%in the SGRE segment) and 8.4% (10.3% in the Gas and Power segment and 4.2% in the SGREsegment) in the fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
9.7.3.7 Other operating income (expenses), net
Other operating income (expenses), net decreased from a net income of €117 million in the
fiscal year 2018 by €164 million to net expenses of €47 million in the fiscal year 2019. Other
operating income fell from €231 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €170 million, or 73.6%, to
€61 million in the fiscal year 2019, primarily as the fiscal year 2018 included gains totaling
€165 million from two divestments in the Gas and Power segment, both attributable to the
Industrial Applications division (see “ 9.4.8.2 Disposal of the Single-stage and Wastewater
Compressor and Small Steam Turbines Business ” and “ 9.4.8.3 Disposal of Parts of the Government
Business and U.S. Navy Service Centers ”). Other operating expenses decreased moderately from
156
€114 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €6 million, or 5.3%, to €108 million in the fiscal year
2019. The fiscal year 2019 included a loss of €54 million from the sale of a site for packaging and
service of rotating equipment in Hengelo, Netherlands, of the Industrial Applications division inthe Gas and Power segment.
9.7.3.8 Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net
Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net increased from a loss
of€85 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €196 million to an income of €111 million in the fiscal
year 2019. This increase resulted primarily from an impairment in the amount of €154 million in
the fiscal year 2018 relating to an at-equity investment in a provider of rotating equipmentservices allocated to Other Operations in the Gas and Power segment, whereas the fiscal year2019 included a €55 million gain from a partial sale of an at-equity investment presented in the
Gas and Power segment’s Transmission division.
9.7.3.9 Financial result
Negative financial result increased from €219 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €61 million, or
27.9%, to €280 million in the fiscal year 2019. Interest income remained flat at €107 million in
the fiscal year 2019 compared to €109 million in the fiscal year 2018. Interest expenses increased
from€324 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €31 million, or 9.6%, to €355 million in the fiscal
year 2019, mainly driven by higher expenses related to the partial early termination andrepayment (at the end of the fiscal year 2019) of USD-denominated loans granted by Siemens toSiemens Energy’s subsidiary Dresser-Rand Group Inc. to finance the acquisition of Dresser-Rand inMay 2015 (the “ Dresser-Rand Loans ”). Other financial income (expenses), net increased from
expenses of €4 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €28 million to expenses of €32 million in the
fiscal year 2019, particularly due to raised expenses for the interest component on provisions.
9.7.3.10 Income before income taxes
Income before income taxes increased from €151 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €166 million
to€317 million in the fiscal year 2019. Since the total of financial result and depreciation and
amortization remained at a stable level in the fiscal years 2018 and 2019, the development ofincome before income taxes was primarily determined by the patterns as discussed for AdjustedEBITA (see “ 9.7.3.13 Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA before Special Items ” below).
9.7.3.11 Income tax (expenses) / gains
In the fiscal year 2019, income tax expenses amounted to €35 million, compared to income tax
gains of €493 million in the fiscal year 2018. The change was attributable to the development of
current tax expenses, which increased from €160 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €309 million
to€469 million in the fiscal year 2019, and deferred tax benefits, which decreased from
€653 million in the fiscal year 2018 by €220 million to €433 million in the fiscal year 2019. In
the fiscal year 2019, current tax expenses included expenses of €44 million due to adjustments
recognized for current tax expenses of prior years, while the fiscal year 2018 was influenced fromthe reassessment of tax positions in different tax jurisdictions, which led to a net benefit of€325 million. Deferred tax net benefits in the fiscal year 2018 were primarily influenced by the
revaluation of deferred taxes in an amount of €264 million caused by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (see “ 9.4.12 Taxation
”) and the accompanying reduction of the corporate income tax on the
federal level from 35% to 21%.
9.7.3.12 Net income
As a result of the factors discussed above, net income declined from €645 million in the fiscal
year 2018 by €363 million, or 56.3%, to €282 million in the fiscal year 2019.
9.7.3.13 Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA before Special Items
Adjusted EBITA of Siemens Energy increased from €905 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€159 million, or 17.6%, to €1,064 million in the fiscal year 2019. The Gas and Power segment
157
reported an improved Adjusted EBITA despite declining sales. In total, negative impacts in the
fiscal year 2018 resulting from capacity adjustments in connection with personnel restructuringwere not recurring to the same extent in the fiscal year 2019. The Adjusted EBITA of the SGREsegment was largely at the prior year level, mainly as positive effects from productivityimprovements were offset by price declines, a less favorable project mix and higher impact fromrestructuring and integration costs combined with costs related to strategic portfolio decisions.Reconciliation items remained largely stable in the fiscal year 2019 when compared with thefiscal year 2018. The Adjusted EBITA Margin of Siemens Energy Group was 3.7% in the fiscal year2019, after 3.2% in the fiscal year 2018.
Special Items (see “ 9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items ”) at
Siemens Energy in the fiscal year 2019 were €453 million compared to €551 million in the fiscal
year 2018, leading to Adjusted EBITA before Special Items in the fiscal year 2019 of€1,517 million compared to €1,456 million in the fiscal year 2018. The respective Adjusted
EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal year 2019 was 5.3%, nearly unchanged to theprior fiscal year.

Gas and Power segment – As Adjusted EBITA decreases in the Industrial Applications and the
Transmission divisions were more than offset by an increase in the Generation division, AdjustedEBITA of the Gas and Power segment increased from €440 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€149 million, or 33.9%, to €589 million in the fiscal year 2019. Negative effects from lower
revenue and reduced capacity utilization were counterbalanced by a continuing strongcontribution from the service business as well as positive effects from project execution andcompletion. Further, Adjusted EBITA benefited from lower severance charges totaling€247 million in the fiscal year 2019, mainly related to the Transmission division and only to a
lesser extent to the Generation division. In the fiscal year 2018, severance charges of€375 million were related mainly to division Generation under the “PG 2020” program (see also
“9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items ”). In the fiscal year
2019, Adjusted EBITA benefited from the partial sale of an at-equity investment, which resultedin a gain of €55 million, allocated to the Transmission division, almost compensated by a loss of
€54 million from the sale of a site for packaging and service of rotating equipment in Hengelo,
Netherlands, of the Industrial Applications division. In the fiscal year 2018, in contrast, theIndustrial Applications division benefited from gains totaling €165 million from the disposal of
two businesses (see “ 9.4.8.2 Disposal of the Single-stage and Wastewater Compressor and Small
Steam Turbines Business ” and “ 9.4.8.3 Disposal of Parts of the Government Business and U.S.
Navy Service Centers ”).
In total, the Gas and Power segment’s Adjusted EBITA Margin increased to 3.1% in the fiscal year
2019, compared to 2.3% in the fiscal year 2018.
Special Items in the Gas and Power segment in the fiscal year 2019 were €247 million, compared
to€375 million in the fiscal year 2018, leading to Adjusted EBITA before Special Items in the
fiscal year 2019 of €836 million, compared to €815 million in the fiscal year 2018. The respective
Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal year 2019 was 4.5%, moderatelyincreased from 4.3% in the fiscal year 2018.
SGRE segment – Adjusted EBITA of the SGRE segment remained nearly stable at €481 million in
the fiscal year 2019, up by €3 million, or 0.6%, from €478 million in the fiscal year 2018. Positive
effects from productivity improvements that were partially related to the “L3AD2020” program(see “ 9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items ”) and higher
revenue were offset by price declines, a less favorable project mix due to a higher volume oflower margin onshore projects and in total higher impacts from restructuring and integrationcosts of €141 million together with costs related to strategic portfolio decisions of €65 million
in the fiscal year 2019 compared to only restructuring and integration costs of €176 million in
the fiscal year 2018. While severance charges, in particular related to capacity adjustments,decreased to €32 million in the fiscal year 2019 from €86 million in the fiscal year 2018,
integration costs increased to €109 million in the fiscal year 2019 from €90 million in the fiscal
159
2018, primarily related to the acceleration of the product portfolio simplification. The Adjusted
EBITA Margin for the fiscal year 2019 of 4.7% decreased clearly from 5.2% in the fiscal year 2018.
Special Items in the SGRE segment in the fiscal year 2019 were €206 million compared to
€176 million in the fiscal year 2018, leading to Adjusted EBITA before Special Items in the fiscal
year 2019 of €687 million, compared to €654 million in the fiscal year 2018. The respective
Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal year 2019 was 6.7%, clearly decreasedfrom 7.2% in the fiscal year 2018.

9.7.4.1 Orders
Orders of Siemens Energy in the fiscal year 2018 of €31,046 million were up by 1,373 million, or
4.6%, from €29,673 million in the fiscal year 2017. A clear decrease of Orders in the Gas and
Power segment was more than offset by a substantial order growth at SGRE. While Order growthin the SGRE segment largely benefited from the merger that led to the formation of SGRE S.A. inthe fiscal year 2017 (see “ 9.4.8.1 Merger of Gamesa and Siemens Wind Power into SGRE and
Acquisition of Iberdrola’s 8.1% Shareholding in SGRE ”), Orders of the Gas and Power segment
showed a clear decrease mainly due to a substantially lower volume from large Orders in thesolutions business of the Transmission division. Total Segments’ Orders from service clearlyincreased in the fiscal year 2018 to €11,776 million by €722 million, or 6.5%, from
€11,054 million in the fiscal year 2017. This led to a service share of 37.8% of Total Segments’
Orders in the fiscal year 2018, slightly above the level of 37.1% in the fiscal year 2017.
160
Total Order intake led to a Book-to-Bill Ratio in the fiscal year 2018 of 1.1 for Siemens Energy,
and the Order Backlog at the end of the fiscal year 2018 amounted to €71 billion.

Gas and Power segment – Orders of the Gas and Power segment decreased clearly from
€21,029 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €1,746 million, or 8.3%, to €19,283 million in the
fiscal year 2018. This was mainly due to a substantially lower volume from large Orders in thesolutions business of the Transmission division, resulting from delays of tenders for large projectsby customers. The Gas and Power segment’s service Orders moderately increased in the fiscal year2018 to €9,323 million by €341 million, or 3.8%, from €8,982 million in the fiscal year 2017,
driven by the Generation division, which were related to the projects in Egypt. This led to aservice Orders share of 48.3% of the segment’s Orders in the fiscal year 2018, significantly abovethe level of 42.7% the fiscal year 2017.
Orders for the divisions Generation and Industrial Applications developed positively, with the
major contribution from the Generation division’s service business. Large Orders of both thesedivisions were up in the EMEA region, while Orders declined in the other two reporting regions,the Americas and Asia, Australia. In the fiscal year 2017, the Generation division had contractedseveral Orders for CCPPs in Thailand, Hong Kong and Pakistan. In contrast, the Transmissiondivision showed a weak intake of large Orders in the EMEA region, where in the fiscal year 2017it recorded an order totaling about €0.8 billion for an offshore grid connection project in
Germany, an Order totaling about €0.6 billion for substations in Qatar and further three HVDC
Orders in the EMEA region.
Based on such Order intake, Gas and Power reached a Book-to-Bill Ratio in the fiscal year 2018 of
1.0. The Order Backlog was €48 billion as of September 30, 2018.
SGRE segment – Orders of the SGRE segment increased from €8,768 million in the fiscal year
2017 by €3,107 million, or 35.4%, to €11,875 million in the fiscal year 2018. Orders benefited
substantially from the merger in the fiscal year 2017 (see “ 9.4.8.1 Merger of Gamesa and Siemens
161
Wind Power into SGRE and Acquisition of Iberdrola’s 8.1% Shareholding in SGRE ”). The recovery
in the onshore market was the first lever driving growth in the SGRE segment’s Order intake,benefitting from the reactivation of major wind markets such as Brazil, Spain, India and SouthAfrica. In addition, the segment’s strong competitive position, which was reinforced by themerger and the launch of the new product portfolio, played a significant role in Order growth.Service Orders increased in the fiscal year 2018 to €2,453 million by €381 million, or 18.4%,
from€2,072 million in the fiscal year 2017. This led to a service Orders share of 20.7% of the
segment’s total Orders, significantly below the level of 23.6% in the fiscal year 2017.
Orders in the fiscal year 2018 included a substantially higher volume from large Orders, among
them an order for an offshore wind power plant, including service, in the United Kingdom worthabout €1.3 billion. Order growth in the Americas and Asia, Australia was driven by Orders from
the United States and India, which continued to be the most important markets for the onshorebusiness.
Based on such Order intake, the SGRE segment reached a Book-to-Bill Ratio in the fiscal year 2018
of 1.3. The Order Backlog was €23 billion as of September 30, 2018.

9.7.4.2 Revenue
Revenue of Siemens Energy decreased from €30,086 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€2,063 million, or 6.9%, to €28,023 million in the fiscal year 2018. The fiscal year 2017
represented an unusually high basis of comparison, as the fiscal year 2017 had included a majorshare of revenue from the execution of the project in Egypt (see “ 9.4.5.1 Project Business ”). The
share of revenue of this project more than halved in the fiscal year 2018. As a result, the Gas andPower segment posted a significant revenue decrease. This decrease was partly offset bysignificant revenue growth year-over-year in the SGRE segment, benefiting from the mergerleading to the formation of SGRE S.A. in the fiscal year 2017. Total Segments’ revenue fromservice in the fiscal year 2018 reached €9,056 million and was with €146 million, or 1.6%,
slightly above €8,910 million in the fiscal year 2017. This led to a service revenue share of 32.2%
of Total Segments’ total revenue, clearly above the level of 29.6% in the fiscal year 2017.

Gas and Power segment – Total revenue of the Gas and Power segment fell from €22,228 million
in the fiscal year 2017 by €3,246 million, or 14.6%, to €18,982 million in the fiscal year 2018. In
contracting gas and power markets caused by trends impacting the segment’s markets (see“9.4.1.1 Trends Impacting the Gas and Power Segment ”), the overall decrease was driven by the
solutions business of the Generation division. The Generation division and, to a limited extent theTransmission division, had recorded significant revenue from the execution of large Ordersrelated to the projects in Egypt in the fiscal year 2017 (see “ 9.4.5.1 Project Business ”), which more
than halved in the fiscal year 2018. The contribution of revenue from large Orders decreasedgenerally driven by weaker Order intake in prior years, particularly in the fiscal year 2017, as thepower generation market had declined significantly since the fiscal year 2016, leading to lowerOrders and revenue in the following years. Moreover, the Transmission division’s business wasimpacted by market cycles of turnkey substations. The Gas and Power segment’s revenue fromservice slightly decreased in the fiscal year 2018 to €7,629 million by €147 million, or 1.9%,
from€7,776 million in the fiscal year 2017, mainly attributable by the Generation division’s
lower revenue contribution following lower Order intake in the fiscal year 2017. This led to aservice revenue share of 40.2% of the segment’s total revenue, significantly above the level of35.0% in the fiscal year 2017.
SGRE segment – Total revenue of the SGRE segment increased from €7,922 million in the fiscal
year 2017 by €1,200 million, or 15.1%, to €9,122 million in the fiscal year 2018. Revenue growth
in the fiscal year 2018 benefited significantly from the merger in the fiscal year 2017 that led tothe formation of SGRE S.A. (see “ 9.4.8.1 Merger of Gamesa and Siemens Wind Power into SGRE
and Acquisition of Iberdrola’s 8.1% Shareholding in SGRE ”). The reported increase of total
revenue in the fiscal year 2018 was driven by strong growth in the onshore business, which offseta price decline. In addition, strong project execution in the offshore business, as well as higherrevenue of value-added solutions from the service business, driven by growth of the fleet undermaintenance, supported the revenue increase. On a geographical basis, growth was mainly
163
coming from the region Asia, Australia, in particular from India where the market in the prior
year was impacted by the introduction of an auction system for wind power plant tenders (see“9.4.1.2 Trends Impacting the SGRE Segment ”). Excluding effects from acquisitions and disposals,
revenue would have decreased clearly year-over-year, negatively affected by currency translationeffects, the project mix, a slower pace of onshore installations and a smaller offshore scopecompared to the fiscal year 2017. Our SGRE segment’s service revenue substantially increased inthe fiscal year 2018 to €1,427 million by €293 million, or 25.8%, from €1,134 million in the
fiscal year 2017, including extraordinary effects from acquisitions and disposals. This led to aservice revenue share of 15.6% of the segment’s total revenue, clearly above the level of 14.3%in the fiscal year 2017.

In the fiscal year 2018, revenue in the EMEA region amounted to €14,881 million, corresponding
to a share of 53.1% of total revenue of Siemens Energy. Revenue in this region was down from€16,471 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €1,590 million or 9.7%, as less revenue from the
projects in Egypt could not be compensated by other projects. Substantial growth in the SGREsegment, mainly due to the merger that led to the formation of SGRE S.A. (see “ 9.4.8.1 Merger
of Gamesa and Siemens Wind Power into SGRE and Acquisition of Iberdrola’s 8.1% Shareholdingin SGRE ”), was more than offset by a decrease of revenues in the Gas and Power segment in the
EMEA region.
The Americas contributed €7,796 million, corresponding to a share of 27.8%, to revenue of
Siemens Energy in the fiscal year 2018, down by €1,316 million, or 14.4%, from €9,112 million
in the fiscal year 2017. Revenue development in this region followed the segment pattern of theEMEA region, as the decrease in the Gas and Power segment more than offset a substantialincrease in the SGRE segment. The decline in the region was mainly related to significantlyreduced revenue in the U.S.
Decreases in revenue in the EMEA region and the Americas were partly offset by increases of
revenue in the Asia, Australia region, which amounted to €5,346 million in the fiscal year 2018,
corresponding to a share of 19.1% of revenue of Siemens Energy in the fiscal year 2018. Whilerevenue in China and Taiwan was nearly level, compared to the prior fiscal year, total revenue inAsia, Australia increased from €4,503 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €843 million, or 18.7%.
The revenue growth was primarily driven by the SGRE segment, in particular from India wherethe market in the prior year was impacted by the introduction of an auction system for windpower plant tenders. Revenue of the Gas and Power segment was down year-over-year in theAsia, Australia region.

9.7.4.3 Cost of Sales
Cost of sales decreased from €24,832 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €956 million, or 3.8%, to
€23,876 million in the fiscal year 2018. In the fiscal year 2018, the Gas and Power segment
posted a clear cost reduction on declining revenue. However, the cost reduction was held back byfactors predominantly effective in the Generation division, including sharply higher severancecharges and reduced capacity utilization, as well as impacts from project-related quality issuesand negative effects related to project execution. The SGRE segment recorded significant highercost of sales broadly in line with the revenue development in the fiscal year 2018. Savings,including synergies, from the transformation program within SGRE’s “L3AD2020” strategyprogram (see “ 9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items ”) partly
offset integration and restructuring costs. Cost of sales before amortization of intangible assetsacquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments amounted to €23,627 million
(thereof €15,695 million in the Gas and Power segment, €8,007 million in the SGRE segment
and€(75) million in Reconciliation) and €24,521 million (thereof €17,551 million in the Gas
and Power segment, €7,036 million in the SGRE segment and €(66) million in Reconciliation) in
the fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets acquired inbusiness combinations and goodwill impairments included in cost of sales amounted to€249 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €79 million; SGRE segment: €169 million) and
€311 million (therein Gas and Power segment: €218 million; SGRE segment €93 million) in the
fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Special Items within cost of sales amounted to€399 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €290 million; SGRE segment: €109 million) and
€28 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €28 million) in the fiscal years 2018 and 2017,
respectively. Cost of sales before amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations and goodwill impairments and Special Items amounted to €23,228 million (thereof
Gas and Power segment: €15,405 million; SGRE segment: €7,898 million; Reconciliation €(75)
million) and €24,493 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €17,523 million; SGRE segment:
€7,036 million; Reconciliation €(66) million) in the fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. This
resulted in cost of sales before amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations and goodwill impairments and Special Items as a percentage of total revenue of82.9% (81.2% in the Gas and Power segment and 86.6% in the SGRE segment) and 81.4% (78.8%in the Gas and Power segment and 88.8% in the SGRE segment) in the fiscal years 2018 and 2017,respectively.
9.7.4.4 Gross profit
Gross profit fell from €5,254 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €1,107 million, or 21.1%, to
€4,147 million in the fiscal year 2018. This decrease was mainly driven by the Gas and Power
segment and its Generation division with a substantial reduction of its gross profit on lowerrevenue and price declines combined with a less favorable cost position and due to sharplyhigher severance charges. The SGRE segment posted a significantly improved gross profit onincreased revenue with a higher share from the service business, combined with an under-proportional increase in cost of sales. The gross profit margin (calculated as the ratio of grossprofit to revenue) of Siemens Energy for the fiscal year 2018 of 14.8% decreased significantly,compared to 17.5% in the fiscal year 2017.
9.7.4.5 Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses decreased from €1,111 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€42 million, or 3.8%, to €1,069 million in the fiscal year 2018. Research and development
expenses declined in both segments in the fiscal year 2018. While SGRE improved its cost position(in terms of revenues), in the Gas and Power segment, the cost reduction was held back by higherseverance charges year-over-year, mainly caused by the Generation division. Research anddevelopment expenses before amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations and goodwill impairments amounted to €1,062 million (thereof €897 million in
the Gas and Power segment, €166 million in the SGRE segment and €(1) million in
Reconciliation) and
€1,110 million (thereof €921 million in the Gas and Power segment,
165
€189 million in the SGRE segment and €(0) million in Reconciliation) in the fiscal years 2018 and
2017, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations andgoodwill impairments included in research and development expenses amounted to €7 million
(thereof Gas and Power segment: €7 million) and €1 million (thereof Gas and Power segment:
€1 million) in the fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Special Items within research and
development expenses amounted to €50 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €32 million;
SGRE segment: €18 million) and €3 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €3 million) in the
fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Research and development expenses before amortizationof intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments and SpecialItems amounted to €1,012 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €865 million; SGRE
segment: €148 million; Reconciliation €(1) million) and €1,107 million (thereof Gas and Power
segment: €918 million; SGRE segment: €189 million; Reconciliation €0 million) in the fiscal
years 2018 and 2017, respectively. This resulted in research and development expenses beforeamortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairmentsand Special Items as a percentage of total revenue of 3.6% (4.6% in the Gas and Power segmentand 1.6% in the SGRE segment) and 3.7% (4.1% in the Gas and Power segment and 2.4% in theSGRE segment) in the fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
9.7.4.6 Selling and general administrative expenses
Selling and general administrative expenses increased from €2,631 million in the fiscal year 2017
by€108 million, or 4.1%, to €2,739 million in the fiscal year 2018. The increase was mainly
driven by additional expenses in relation to the Gas and Powers segment’s measures to improveits competitiveness, as well as integration and restructuring measures in the SGRE segment.Selling and general administrative expenses before expenses before amortization of intangibleassets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments amounted to €2,449 million
(thereof €2,015 million in the Gas and Power segment, €426 million in the SGRE segment and
Reconciliation of €8 million) and €2,436 million (thereof €2,086 million in the Gas and Power
segment, €343 million in the SGRE segment and Reconciliation of €7 million) in the fiscal years
2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinationsincluded in selling and general administrative expenses amounted to €290 million (thereof Gas
and Power: €154 million; SGRE segment: €136 million) and €195 million (thereof Gas and
Power segment: €47 million, SGRE segment: €148 million) in the fiscal years 2018 and 2017,
respectively. Special items within selling and general administrative expenses amounted to€96 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €53 million; SGRE segment: €43 million) and
€34 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €12 million; SGRE segment: €
22 million) in the
fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Selling and general administrative expenses beforeamortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairmentsand Special Items amounted to €2,353 million (thereof Gas and Power segment: €1,962 million;
SGRE segment: €383 million; Reconciliation €8 million) and €2,402 million (thereof
€2,074 million in the Gas and Power segment and €321 million in the SGRE segment;
Reconciliation €7 million) in the fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. This resulted in selling
and general administrative expenses before amortization of intangible assets acquired inbusiness combinations and goodwill impairments and Special Items as a percentage of totalrevenue of 8.4% (10.3% in the Gas and Power segment and 4.2% in the SGRE segment) and 8.0%(9.3% in the Gas and Power segment and 4.1% in the SGRE segment) in the fiscal years 2018 and2017, respectively.
9.7.4.7 Other operating income (expenses), net
Other operating income (expenses), net increased from expenses of €88 million in the fiscal year
2017 by €205 million to income of €117 million in the fiscal year 2018. Other operating income
increased from €38 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €193 million to €231 million in the fiscal
year 2018. The increase was due to €165 million gains related to the sale of businesses at the Gas
and Power segment (see “ 9.4.8.2 Disposal of the Single-stage and Wastewater Compressor and
Small Steam Turbines Business ” and “ 9.4.8.3 Disposal of Parts of the Government Business and
U.S. Navy Service Centers ”), both allocated to the Industrial Applications division. Other
166
operating expenses decreased from €126 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €12 million, or 9.5%,
to€114 million in the fiscal year 2018.
9.7.4.8 Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net
Income (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method, net decreased from an
income of €65 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €150 million to a loss of €85 million in the
fiscal year 2018. This swing was mainly due to an impairment loss of €154 million related to an
at-equity investment in a provider of rotating equipment services allocated to Other Operationsin the Gas and Power segment. The impairment based on the continuing adverse marketenvironment.
9.7.4.9 Financial result
Negative financial result increased from €181 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €38 million, or
21.0%, to €219 million in the fiscal year 2018. Interest income slightly decreased from
€111 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €2 million, or 1.8%, to €109 million in the fiscal year
2018. Interest expenses increased from €298 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €26 million, or
8.7%, to €324 million in the fiscal year 2018. This increase was primarily related to higher
interest paid to banks and interest related expenses, mainly in the SGRE segment and primarilyrelated to the merger that led to the formation of SGRE S.A. Other financial income (expenses),net decreased from income of €5 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €9 million to expenses of
€4 million in the fiscal year 2018.
9.7.4.10 Income before income taxes
Income before income taxes fell from €1,309 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €1,158 million to
€151 million in the fiscal year 2018. Since the total of financial result and depreciation and
amortization remained broadly stable in the fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the development ofincome before income taxes is determined by the patterns as discussed for Adjusted EBITA (see“9.7.4.13 Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA before Special Items ” below).
9.7.4.11 Income tax (expenses) / gains
In the fiscal year 2018, income tax gains of €493 million were recognized while income tax
expenses in the fiscal year 2017 amounted to €349 million. The change was attributable to the
development of current tax expenses, which decreased from €536 million in the fiscal year 2017
by€376 million to €160 million in the fiscal year 2018, and deferred tax benefits, which
increased from €188 million in the fiscal year 2017 by €465 million to €653 million in the fiscal
year 2018. The current tax expenses in the fiscal year 2018 were influenced from reassessment oftax positions in different tax jurisdictions in the fiscal year 2018, which led to a tax net benefit of€325 million, compared to adjustments recognized for current taxes of prior years resulting in
income tax expenses of €39 million in the fiscal year 2017. The deferred tax net benefits in the
fiscal year 2018 were primarily influenced by the revaluation of deferred taxes in an amount of€264 million caused by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (see “ 9.4.12 Taxation ”) and the
accompanying reduction of the corporate income tax on the federal level from 35% to 21%.
9.7.4.12 Net income
As a result of the factors discussed above, net income fell from €960 million in the fiscal year
2017 by €315 million, or 32.8%, to
€645 million in the fiscal year 2018.
9.7.4.13 Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA before Special Items
Adjusted EBITA of Siemens Energy sharply fell from €2,028 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€1,123 million to €905 million in the fiscal year 2018. This drop was mainly attributable to the
Gas and Power segment’s decline in Adjusted EBITA, which primarily resulted from the decreaseof gross profit and sharply increased severance charges across all functional costs, as well as amajor impairment. This decrease was only partially offset by the increase of the SGRE segment’s
167
Adjusted EBITA driven by higher revenues, a more favorable business mix and operational
improvements during the fiscal year 2018 as well as lower asset write-downs. Reconciliation itemsremained largely stable in the fiscal year 2018 when compared with the fiscal year 2017. TheAdjusted EBITA Margin of Siemens Energy for the fiscal year 2018 of 3.2% decreased sharply,compared to 6.7% in the fiscal year 2017.
Special Items (see “ 9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items ”) of
Siemens Energy in the fiscal year 2018 were €551 million compared to €146 million in the fiscal
year 2017, leading to Adjusted EBITA before Special Items in the fiscal year 2018 of€1,456 million, compared to €2,174 million in the fiscal year 2017. The respective Adjusted
EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal year 2018 was 5.2% and substantially decreasedfrom 7.2% in the fiscal year 2017.

Gas and Power segment – Despite a continuing strong contribution from the services business,
Adjusted EBITA of the Gas and Power segment sharply fell from €1,703 million in the fiscal year
2017 by €1,263 million, or 74.2%, to €440 million in the fiscal year 2018. This was mainly due to
the contribution of the Generation division and to a lesser extent of the Industrial Applicationsdivision, while the Transmission division posted an improvement. The drop in the Gas and Powersegment’s Adjusted EBITA was primarily due to reduced capacity utilization, lower revenue, pricedeclines and negative effects from project-related quality issues, cost increases as well as contractpenalties. Furthermore, the segment’s Adjusted EBITA was impacted by the impairment of anat-equity investment in a provider of rotating equipment services of €154 million allocated to
Other Operations in the Gas and Power segment as well as restructuring costs related tomeasures to improve the segment’s competitiveness. The segment’s burdens from severancecharges increased sharply from €43 million in the fiscal year 2017 to €375 million in the fiscal
year 2018, and were predominantly related to the Generation division (see also“9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items ”). These negative
effects were partly offset by gains totaling €165 million from the disposal of two businesses (see
“9.4.8.2 Disposal of the Single-stage and Wastewater Compressor and Small Steam Turbines
Business ” and “ 9.4.8.3 Disposal of Parts of the Government Business and U.S. Navy Service
Centers ”) of the Industrial Applications division. The Adjusted EBITA Margin of the Gas and
Power segment for the fiscal year 2018 of 2.3% decreased sharply from 7.7% in the fiscal year2017.
Special Items of the Gas and Power segment in the fiscal year 2018 were €375 million, compared
to€43 million in the fiscal year 2017, leading to Adjusted EBITA before Special Items in the fiscal
year 2018 of €815 million, compared to €1,746 million in the fiscal year 2017. The respective
Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items of the Gas and Power segment in the fiscal year 2018was 4.3%, sharply decreased from 7.9% in the fiscal year 2017.
SGRE segment – Adjusted EBITA of the SGRE segment increased from €330 million in the fiscal
year 2017 by €148 million, or 44.8%, to €478 million in the fiscal year 2018, was primarily
driven by the revenue increase, a higher services revenue, and operational improvements. Thesefactors were partially offset by price declines, especially in the onshore markets. In the prior year,Adjusted EBITA was burdened by expenses totaling €134 million primarily from inventory write-
downs. Both years were impacted by significant restructuring and integration costs totaling€176 million and €103 million in the fiscal year 2018 and the fiscal year 2017, respectively, and
mainly related to post-merger integration after the formation of SGRE S.A. (see “ 9.4.8.1 Merger
of Gamesa and Siemens Wind Power into SGRE and Acquisition of Iberdrola’s 8.1% Shareholdingin SGRE ” and also “ 9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items ”).
Restructuring and integration costs in the fiscal years 2017 and 2018 were targeted at bringingforward synergy delivery with a focus on reduction of employment positions and product
169
portfolio adaptions. The SGRE segment’s Adjusted EBITA Margin for the fiscal year 2018 of 5.2%
increased substantially from 4.2% in the fiscal year 2017.
Special Items of the SGRE segment in the fiscal year 2018 were €176 million, compared to
€103 million in the fiscal year 2017, leading to Adjusted EBITA before Special Items of the SGRE
segment in the fiscal year 2018 of €654 million, compared to €433 million in the fiscal year
2017. The respective Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items of the SGRE segment in thefiscal year 2018 was 7.2%, substantially increased from 5.5% in the fiscal year 2017.

9.8.2 Assets
9.8.2.1 Comparison as of June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019Siemens Energy applied IFRS 16 for the first time from October 1, 2019. First time application
affected the assets of Siemens Energy as set out under “ 9.5 Key Factors Affecting Comparability ”
above. Since Siemens Energy applied the “modified retrospective approach”, there is limitedcomparability of the assets as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020.
Total assets increased from €45,041 million as of September 30, 2019 by €383 million, or 0.9%,
to€45,424 million as of June 30, 2020. This development was mainly due to financing-related
topics and the first-time adoption of IFRS 16 as Carve-Out-related activities resulted in increasedfinancing-related balances with Siemens Group and the application of IFRS 16 led to the initialrecognition of right-of-use assets. These increases were partly offset by decreases due to changesin the operating net working capital and certain individual topics.
Total current assets of €24,917 million as of September 30, 2019 remained broadly unchanged at
€24,491 million as of June 30, 2020. Receivables from Siemens Group, mostly comprising
financing related balances, rose from €3,402 million as of September 30, 2019 by €492 million,
or 14.5%, to €3,894 million as of June 30, 2020, mainly related to Carve-Out-related activities
during the first nine months of the fiscal year 2020 (see “ 9.9.6.1 Financial Liabilities ”). Cash and
cash equivalents, mostly comprising cash and cash equivalents from the SGRE segment, increasedfrom€1,871 million as of September 30, 2019 by €481 million, or 25.7%, to €2,352 million as
of June 30, 2020. These increases were largely offset by a decrease in components of operatingnet working capital (for a discussion, see “ 9.9.3 Operating Net Working
Capital” below).
Total non-current assets increased from €20,124 million as of September 30, 2019 by
€809 million, or 4.0%, to €20,933 million as of June 30, 2020. This change primarily resulted
171
from an increase in property, plant and equipment from €3,275 million as of September 30,
2019 by €1,515 million, or 46.3%, to €4,790 million as of June 30, 2020, mainly as a result of the
initial recognition of right-of-use assets with regard to the adoption of IFRS 16, the transfer ofreal estate assets previously leased from Siemens Real Estate to Siemens Energy and otherCarve-Out-related asset transfers, and to a minor extent related to the acquisition of theEuropean service business of Senvion in the SGRE segment (see “ 9.4.8.4 Acquisition of Senvion
Group Assets ”), less regular depreciations. In addition, deferred tax assets increased from
€742 million as of September 30, 2019 by €310 million, or 41.8%, to €1,052 million as of June
30, 2020, due to Carve-out-related tax benefits, e.g., the early termination and repayment of the
last outstanding loan of the Dresser-Rand Loans, and tax loss carryforwards. These increases werepartly offset by decreases in goodwill and other intangible assets from together €14,558 million
as of September 30, 2019 by €949 million, or 6.5%, to €13,609 million as of June 30, 2020. The
decrease of goodwill was mainly due to currency translation differences, partly offset bygoodwill resulting from the acquisition of the European service business of Senvion andCarve-Out-related asset transfers. Other intangible assets declined as a result of regularamortizations and impairments of intellectual property rights in relation to intangible assetsacquired in business combinations in the Gas and Power segment in an amount of €476 million,
less additions with regard to internally generated technology as well as customer relationshipsand the Order Backlog related to the acquisition of the European service business of Senvion,both in the SGRE segment (see “ 9.4.8.4 Acquisition of Senvion Group Assets ”).
9.8.2.2 Comparison as of September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018
Total assets decreased from €45,763 million as of September 30, 2018 by €722 million, or 1.6%,
to€45,041 million as of September 30, 2019. The main drivers for this development were
financing related topics and the change in operating net working capital. Reduced financingrelated balances with Siemens Group, and the SGRE segment optimizing its cash position led to adecrease in total assets, while an overall increase of assets within operating net working capitalpartly offset this reduction.
Total current assets decreased from €26,006 million as of September 30, 2018 by €1,089 million,
or 4.2%, to €24,917 million as of September 30, 2019. This decrease resulted, among others,
from a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, mostly comprising cash and cash equivalents fromthe SGRE segment, from €2,544 million as of September 30, 2018 by €673 million, or 26.5%, to
€1,871 million as of September 30, 2019, which was largely driven by a reduction in the use of its
credit lines to optimize available cash as reflected in the reduction of short-term debt andcurrent maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt (as described under “ 9.8.3.2 Comparison
as of September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 ” below). Receivables from Siemens Group,
mostly comprising financing related balances, fell from €5,138 million as of September 30, 2018
by€1,736 million, or 33.8%, to €3,402 million as of September 30, 2019, partially related to the
partial early termination and repayment of Dresser-Rand Loans. These decreases were partiallyoffset by increases in components of operating net working capital (for a discussion, see“9.9.3 Operating Net Working Capital” below). Other current financial assets increased from
€454 million as of September 30, 2018 by €276 million, or 60.8%, to €730 million as of
September 30, 2019, mostly driven by changes in fair value of embedded and currencyderivatives. Other current assets increased from €833 million as of September 30, 2018 by
€260 million, or 31.2%, to €1,093 million as of September 30, 2019, mainly driven by an
increase in sales tax receivables.
Total non-current assets increased from €19,757 million as of September 30, 2018 by
€367 million, or 1.9%, to €20,124 million as of September 30, 2019. This change primarily
resulted from an increase in goodwill from €9,462 million as of September 30, 2018 by
€353 million or 3.7%, to
€9,815 million as of September 30, 2019, mostly due to currency
translation differences. In addition, property, plant and equipment increased from €
3,085 million as of September 30, 2018 by €190 million, or 6.2%, to €3,275 million as of
September 30, 2019. This increase largely resulted from transfers of assets as part of the carve-outof the Siemens Energy business in the U.S. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in
172
other intangible assets from €4,967 million as of September 30, 2018 by €224 million, or 4.5%,
to€4,743 million as of September 30, 2019, primarily due to regular amortizations of assets, the
effect of which were less pronounced when compared to the fiscal year 2018 due toadvantageous translation differences.
9.8.2.3 Comparison as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017
Total assets decreased from €47,290 million as of September 30, 2017 by €1,527 million, or
3.2%, to €45,763 million as of September 30, 2018. The decline in total assets was mainly due to
a reduced level of financing related balances with Siemens Group and the regular ongoingbusiness, including amortization of other intangible assets and the impairment of an at-equityinvestment.
Total current assets decreased from €26,470 million as of September 30, 2017 by €464 million,
or 1.8%, to €26,006 million as of September 30, 2018. That mainly resulted from a decrease in
receivables from Siemens Group, mostly comprising financing related balances, which fell from€6,324 million as of September 30, 2017 by €1,186 million, or 18.8%, to €5,138 million as of
September 30, 2018. This decrease was partially offset by increases in components of operatingnet working capital (for a discussion, see “ 9.9.3 Operating Net Working Capital ” below) and an
increase in cash and cash equivalents from €1,850 million as of September 30, 2017 by
€694 million, or 37.5%, to €2,544 million as of September 30, 2018, comprising mostly cash and
cash equivalents from the SGRE segment, which was largely driven by SGRE drawing from a newmulti-currency revolving credit facility as reflected in the increase in short-term debt and currentmaturities of long-term debt and long-term debt (as described under “ 9.8.3.3 Comparison as of
September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 ” below).
Total non-current assets decreased from €20,821 million as of September 30, 2017 by
€1,064 million, or 5.1%, to €19,757 million as of September 30, 2018. That was mainly due to a
decrease in other intangible assets, which decreased from €5,449 million as of September 30,
2017 by €482 million, or 8.8% to €4,967 million September 30, 2018 due to regular
amortization charges and a decrease in investments accounted for using the equity method from€933 million as of September 30, 2017, by €149 million, or 16.0%, to €784 million as of
September 30, 2018, mainly related to an impairment loss of €154 million with regard to an
at-equity investment in a provider of rotating services allocated to Other Operations in the Gasand Power segment.
9.8.3 Liabilities
9.8.3.1 Comparison as of June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019Siemens Energy applied IFRS 16 for the first time from October 1, 2019. First time application
affected the liabilities of Siemens Energy as set out under “ 9.5 Key Factors Affecting
Comparability ” above. Since Siemens Energy applied the “modified retrospective approach”,
there is limited comparability of the liabilities as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020.
Total liabilities decreased from €31,952 million as of September 30, 2019 by €2,779 million, or
8.7%, to €29,173 million as of June 30, 2020. Therein reflected are to a wide extent the same
reasons as for the development of total assets, in particular regarding Carve-Out-related activities(see “ 9.9.6.1 Financial Liabilities ”) and the first-time adoption of IFRS 16, which led to the initial
recognition of lease liabilities within short- and long-term debt. Carve-Out related activities leadto a reduction in financing related balances with Siemens Group and a decline in pensionliabilities, partly offset by the effects of IFRS 16 and changes in the operating net workingcapital.
Total current liabilities decreased from €23,487 million as of September 30, 2019 by
€1,055 million, or 4.5%, to €22,432 million as of June 30, 2020. Short-term debt and current
maturities of long-term debt increased from €359 million as of September 30, 2019 by
€428 million, or 119.2%, to €787 million as of June 30, 2020 primarily due to recognized lease
liabilities with regard to the adoption of IFRS 16 and an increase mainly in the SGRE segment
173
which is related to increased cash and cash equivalents of the SGRE segment (see
“9.8.2.1 Comparison as of June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 ”). Furthermore, increases in
components of operating net working capital (for a discussion, see “ 9.9.3 Operating Net Working
Capital ” below) resulted in an increase of total current liabilities. These increases were more than
offset by the diminishing effects related to payables to Siemens Group, mostly comprisingfinancing related balances, which decreased from €2,960 million as of September 30, 2019 by
€1,981 million, or 66.9%, to €979 million as of June 30, 2020, and reduced other current
liabilities, which decreased from €3,267 million as of September 30, 2019 by €263 million, or
8.1%, to €3,004 million as of June 30, 2020, mainly due to declined liabilities to personnel and
sales tax liabilities.
Total non-current liabilities decreased from €8,465 million as of September 30, 2019 by
€1,724 million, or 20.4%, to €6,741 million as of June 30, 2020. This was mainly due to a
decrease in other liabilities to Siemens Group, mostly comprising financing related balances, from€1,608 million as of September 30, 2019 to zero as of June 30, 2020. The decrease was due to
the early termination and repayment of the last outstanding loan of the Dresser-Rand Loans (see“9.9.6.1 Financial Liabilities” ). Provisions for pensions and similar obligations decreased from
€1,960 million as of September 30, 2019 by €865 million, or 44.1%, to €1,095 million as of
June 30, 2020 mainly due a funding of the pension obligations of German Group companies byapproximately €915 million (see “ 9.9.6.2 Pensions and Similar Obligations ”). In addition,
deferred tax liabilities decreased from €1,102 million as of September 30, 2019 by €516 million,
or 46.8%, to €586 million as of June 30, 2020, due to, amongst others, impairments of
intellectual property rights not recognized for tax purposes .These decreases were partially offset
by an increase in long-term debt which increased from €547 million as of September 30, 2019 by
€1,143 million to €1,690 million as of June 30, 2020, primarily due to recognized lease liabilities
with regard to the adoption of IFRS 16 and an increase mainly in the SGRE segment, which isrelated to increased cash and cash equivalents of the SGRE segment (see “ 9.8.2.1 Comparison as
of June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 ”).
9.8.3.2 Comparison as of September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018
Total liabilities decreased from €35,062 million as of September 30, 2018 by €3,110 million, or
8.9%, to €31,952 million as of September 30, 2019. The change in total liabilities mirrored the
development of total assets regarding financing related topics and operating net working capitalmentioned above. This was reflected in a decrease in the SGRE segment’s debt and reducedfinancing related balances with Siemens Group, partly offset by increased liabilities within theoperating net working capital.
Total current liabilities slightly increased from €23,418 million as of September 30, 2018 by
€69 million, or 0.3%, to €23,487 million as of September 30, 2019. Short-term debt and current
maturities of long-term debt, which mostly relate to the SGRE segment, decreased from€1,000 million as of September 30, 2018 by €641 million, or 64.1%, to €359 million as of
September 30, 2019, as SGRE reduced its use of its credit lines to optimize available cash, asreflected in the reduction of cash and cash equivalents (as described under “ 9.8.2.2 Comparison
as of September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 ” above). Payables to Siemens Group, mostly
comprising financing related balances, decreased from €3,958 million as of September 30, 2018
by€
998 million, or 25.2%, to €2,960 million as of September 30, 2019. These decreases were
more than offset by increases in components of operating net working capital (for a discussion,see “ 9.9.3 Operating Net Working Capital” below).
Total non-current liabilities decreased from €11,644 million as of September 30, 2018 by
€3,179 million, or 27.3%, to €8,465 million as of September 30, 2019. This was mainly due to a
decrease in other liabilities to Siemens Group, mostly comprising financing related balances, from€4,576 million as of September 30, 2018, by €2,968 million, or 64.9%, to €1,608 million as of
September 30, 2019. This decrease was mainly driven by the partial early termination andrepayment of Dresser-Rand Loans. Long-term debt, which mainly relates to the SGRE segment,decreased from €877 million as of September 30, 2018 by €330 million, or 37.6%, to
174
€547 million as of September 30, 2019 as SGRE reduced the use of its credit lines, as also
reflected in the reduction of cash and cash equivalents (as described under “ 9.8.2.2 Comparison
as of September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 ” above). Provisions decreased from
€2,400 million as of September 30, 2018 by €328 million, or 13.7%, to €2,072 million as of
September 30, 2019, mostly driven by provisions for order-related losses and risks. Thesedecreases were partially offset by the increase in provisions for pensions and similar obligations,which increased from €1,622 million as of September 30, 2018 by €338 million, or 20.8%, to
€1,960 million as of September 30, 2019 due to a lower discount rate partially offset by positive
returns on plan assets.
9.8.3.3 Comparison as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017
Total liabilities decreased from €35,973 million as of September 30, 2017 by €911 million, or
2.5%, to €35,062 million as of September 30, 2018. The change in total liabilities reflects regular
ongoing business, including a decrease of deferred tax liabilities as well as reduced provisions,mainly in the SGRE segment.
Total current liabilities increased from €22,221 million as of September 30, 2017 by
€1,197 million, or 5.4%, to €23,418 million as of September 30, 2018. This increase mainly
resulted from an increase in payables to Siemens Group, mostly comprising financing relatedbalances, which increased from €2,624 million as of September 30, 2017 by €1,334 million, or
50.8%, to €3,958 million as of September 30, 2018. This increase was offset to a lower extent by
a decrease in components of operating net working capital (for a discussion, see “ 9.9.3 Operating
Net Working Capital ” below). Short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt, which
primarily relate to the SGRE segment, increased from €819 million as of September 30, 2017 by
€181 million, or 22.1%, to €1,000 million as of September 30, 2018 as SGRE drew loans under a
new multi-currency revolving credit facility (see also “ 9.9.1.2 Financing Structure of the SGRE
Segment ”).
Total non-current liabilities decreased from €13,752 million as of September 30, 2017 by
€2,108 million, or 15.3%, to €11,644 million as of September 30, 2018. This was mainly due to a
decrease in other liabilities to Siemens Group, mostly comprising financing-related balances, from€5,957 million as of September 30, 2017, by €1,381 million, or 23.2%, to €4,576 million as of
September 30, 2018, primarily related to the partial early termination and repayment of theDresser-Rand Loans. Deferred tax liabilities decreased from €1,904 million as of September 30,
2017 by €709 million, or 37.2%, to €1,195 million as of September 30, 2018, mainly driven by
the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities caused by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (see also“9.4.12 Taxation ”). These decreases were partly offset by increased long-term debt, which mainly
relate to the SGRE segment, from €505 million as of September 30, 2017 by €372 million, or
73.7%, to €877 million as of September 30, 2018, as SGRE drew loans under a new multi-
currency revolving credit facility (see also “ 9.9.1.2 Financing Structure of the SGRE Segment ”).
Provisions decreased from €2,664 million as of September 30, 2017 by €264 million, or 9.9%, to
€
2,400 million as of September 30, 2018, mainly related to the SGRE segment and in particular
with regard to reduced provisions for warranties and order-related losses and risks.
9.8.4 Equity
Total equity increased from €13,089 million as of September 30, 2019 by €3,161 million, or
24.2%, to €16,250 million as of June 30, 2020. The decrease in the earnings development,
reflected by total comprehensive loss of €2,135 million in the nine-month period ended June 30,
2020, was more than offset by increases which were mainly due to effects from applying thecombination rules described in Note 1 to the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim FinancialStatements. These effects resulted in a net increase of total equity of €5,521 million and were
mainly related to transactions in the course of the formation of the Group, in particular (i) thefunding of the pension obligations of the German Group entities (see “ 9.9.6.2 Pensions and
Similar Obligations ”), (ii) Carve-Out-related asset transfers and (iii) transactions for the purpose
of achieving the envisaged capital structure and liquidity position of Siemens Energy.
175
Total equity increased from €10,701 million as of September 30, 2018 by €2,388 million, or
22.3%, to €13,089 million as of September 30, 2019. Besides the earnings development,
reflected by total comprehensive income of €479 million in the fiscal year 2019, the increase was
mainly due to effects from applying the combination rules described in Note 1 to the AuditedCombined Financial Statements. These effects resulted in a net increase of total equity of€2,201 million (as presented in the line item Other changes in the Combined Statements of
Changes in Invested Equity for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019). Those mainly relate toconsiderations given in the course of the formation of the Group, in particular for the partialearly termination and repayment of Dresser-Rand Loans.
Total equity decreased from €11,318 million as of September 30, 2017 by €617 million, or 5.5%,
to€10,701 million as of September 30, 2018. The decrease results from dividends and profit and
loss transfers with owners of €415 million, as well as effects from applying the combination rules
described in Note 1 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements, resulting in an equityreduction of €228 million, mainly in conjunction with taxes incurred by Siemens Group related
to Siemens Energy operations, and changes in the conversion of receivables and payables to cashrelated to Siemens Energy operations.
9.9 Liquidity and Capital Resources
9.9.1 Overview
The following section presents Siemens Energy Group’s liquidity situation and capital resources in
the periods presented by segment. For information regarding financial liabilities and Net Debt ofSiemens Energy, see “ 9.9.6.1 Financial Liabilities ”.
9.9.1.1 Financing Structure of the Gas and Power Segment
9.9.1.1.1 Financing Structure Prior to the Spin-OffThe Gas and Power segment has historically financed its capital expenditures and working capital
requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and intercompanyfinancing from Siemens Group. Until Spin-Off Completion, it will continue to participate inSiemens Group’s intercompany funding program, which includes certain intercompany loans anddeposits, cash management and cash pooling arrangements as well as indirect financing via localbanks backed by global letters of support issued by Siemens. The cash management systemprovides, among others, a Siemens Group-wide system for clearing and settlement of payablesand receivables between Siemens Energy Group and Siemens Group. In addition, such cashmanagement system is, for example, used for the Group’s payment and receipt of funds to andfrom external parties.
Siemens Energy’s payables to the Siemens Group from financing activities slightly decreased from
€8,519 million as of September 30, 2017 by €25 million, or 0.3%, to €8,494 million as of
September 30, 2018 and decreased by €3,959 million to €4,535 million as of September 30,
2019. The decrease as of September 30, 2019 compared to September 30, 2018 was mainlyattributable to the partial early termination and repayment of Dresser-Rand Loans. Theremaining outstanding loan in an amount of €1,571 million was terminated in February 2020
and has been repaid without impact on the Combined Statements of Income. With this andassociated with certain capitalization measures during the nine-month period ended June 30,2020 (see “ 9.9.6.1 Financial Liabilities ”), payables to Siemens Group from financing activities to
the Siemens Group further decreased as of June 30, 2020 to €862 million.
Siemens Energy also had short-term receivables from Siemens Group amounting to €322 million
as of September 30, 2019 (September 30, 2018: €2,220 million; September 30, 2017: €2,678
million). The decrease in the fiscal year 2019 related mainly to the partial early termination andrepayment of Dresser-Rand Loans. In February 2020, the last outstanding loan of the Dresser-Rand Loans was terminated early and repaid in an amount of €1,571 million.

9.9.1.1.2 Financing Structure Following to the Spin-Off
In connection with the Spin-Off, the previous intercompany financing program of Siemens Group
will be replaced by a similar intercompany financing program operated by Siemens Energy thatwill provide cash management and pooling arrangements, clearing and settlement of intra-groupand external payables and receivables, financing and liquidity investment opportunities toparticipating Siemens Energy Group companies (excluding SGRE). In July 2020, SE Global GmbH &Co. KG and Siemens Energy Finance B.V. as initial borrowers and a syndicate of internationalbanks as lenders have concluded a facility agreement including a €3.0 billion revolving credit
facility to be used for general corporate purposes. The facility may be drawn in differentcurrencies, including euro, British Pound or U.S. dollar. The facility agreement has an initial termof three years, with two extension options for one year each, which are however at thediscretion of the lenders. Siemens Energy AG is required to accede to the facility agreementshortly after Spin-Off Completion. As of the date of this Prospectus, no amounts have beendrawn under the facility agreement. For further information on the facility agreement, see“12.9.1 Siemens Energy Facility Agreement ”.
For an overview of Siemens Energy’s financial liabilities as of June 30, 2020, see “ 9.9.6.1 Financial
Liabilities ”.
9.9.1.2 Financing Structure of the SGRE Segment
The SGRE segment did not participate in Siemens Group’s intercompany funding program
mentioned above, especially with regard to cash pooling arrangements. The SGRE segment isfinanced at the level of SGRE. The short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt aswell as long-term debt as presented in the Combined Statements of Financial Position as ofSeptember 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 mainly relate to a multi-currency revolving creditfacility and a loan signed as of May 30, 2018 by SGRE, amounting both to a total of€2,500 million, which replaced a €750 million credit facility from 2017. The facility was
renegotiated in December 2019 with extended maturity dates and includes a term loan trancheof€500 million maturing in 2022 (previously maturing in 2021) and a revolving credit line
tranche of €2,000 million maturing in 2024 (previously maturing in 2023) with two one-year
extension options. As of June 30, 2020, €500 million (September 30, 2019: €500 million;
September 30, 2018: €700 million) have been drawn. The facility may be used for general
corporate purposes and to refinance outstanding debt.
In January 2020, SGRE signed two new loans amounting to €240 million, both with maturity in
2023. Additionally, in May 2020, two new bilateral short-term credit lines amounting to€125 million were signed, which will mature in 2021.
In March and May 2019, SGRE signed new bilateral credit lines amounting to €512 million, of
which €412 million mature in 2020 and €100 million are extendable by tacit agreement until
2022, accruing an average interest rate of 0.33%. During the nine-month period ended June 30,2020, the €412 million credit lines were extended until 2021. As of June 30, 2020, SGRE has not
drawn any amount related to these credit lines. In July 2020, SGRE increased a bilateral credit lineincluded in the €512 million from €100 million to €150 million.
As of September 30, 2019, SGRE has bilateral credit lines in India with annual maturities for an
amount of €304 million. As of June 30, 2020, these credit lines amounted to €414 million, of
which €386 million were drawn.
As of September 30, 2019, SGRE units had been granted loans and had drawn from credit
facilities that accounted for 23% of the total financing granted to them maturing between 2019and 2029 (September 30, 2018: 46% granted; maturing between 2018 and 2026, September 30,2017: 48% granted; maturing between 2017 and 2026).
As of September 30, 2017, SGRE was using loan agreements amounting to €424 million with
certain obligations as the compliance with financial ratios throughout the life of the agreementrelating to the capacity to generate resources in the operations, to the debt level and financialduties. Also, these arrangements established certain limits to the arrangement of additionalborrowings and to the distribution of dividends, as well as other conditions. Not meeting these
177
contractual conditions would have enabled the banks to demand early repayment. As of
September 30, 2017, the established financial ratios were met. As of September 30, 2019 andSeptember 30, 2018, the loans were no longer outstanding and accordingly, the conditions do nolonger apply.
As of June 30, 2020, total existing credit lines of the SGRE segment amounted to €4,006 million
of which €2,837 million were unused.

a)Therein included are income taxes paid for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and the nine-month
period ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 of €287 million, €541 million and €618 million, and €254 million and
€147 million, respectively.
Since cash flows from financing activities of the Gas and Power segment were mainly determined
by inter-company financing from Siemens Group, we believe that cash flows from financingactivities shown in the table above and discussed below are not indicative for Siemens Energy’sfuture cash flows from financing activities from a stand-alone perspective.
9.9.2.1 Comparison of Cash Flows in the Nine-Month Periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019
9.9.2.1.1 Cash Flows From Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities of negative €585 million in the nine-month period ended
June 30, 2019 swung to positive cash flows from operating activities of €561 million in the same
period of the fiscal year 2020. This was mainly due to a positive change in operating net workingcapital and despite the negative profit development. The improvement of operating net workingcapital was across all its components and particularly due to the development of inventories andcontract liabilities. In total, the change in operating net working capital resulted in net cashinflows in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 of €879 million compared to net cash
outflows of €875 million in the same period of fiscal year 2019. Furthermore, cash outflows from
the change in other assets and liabilities improved sharply to €296 million in the nine-month
period ended June 30, 2020 from €953 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2019, related
to miscellaneous topics, amongst others, due to the change in provisions for order related lossesand risks as well as in value added and sales tax receivables. This was partially offset from cashoutflows from income taxes paid of €254 million, sharply increased compared to outflows of
€147 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 since the lower cash outflows of the
prior year period were primarily attributable to a refund of income taxes from the tax groupwith Siemens Industrial in the U.S.
9.9.2.1.2 Cash Flows From Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities substantially decreased to cash outflows of €653 million in
the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, compared to cash outflows of €503 million in the
same period of fiscal year 2019. This decrease resulted mainly from acquisitions of businesses, netof cash acquired, as SGRE acquired selected European assets of Senvion Group during the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 (see “ 9.4.8.4 Acquisition of Senvion Group Assets ”), which led
to cash outflows of €177 million. Furthermore, additions to intangible assets and property, plant
and equipment moderately increased from €515 million in the nine-month period ended
June 30, 2019 by €28 million to €543 million in the same period of the fiscal year 2020. This was
partly offset by cash inflows from disposal of businesses, net of cash disposed, which swung fromcash outflows of €58 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 to cash inflows of
€39 million in the same period of fiscal year 2020, the latter related to the sale of minor business
activities of the divisions Transmission and Industrial Applications of the Gas and Power segmentin the U.S. and France which is aimed for streamlining their business portfolios.
179
9.9.2.1.3 Cash Flows From Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities amounted to cash inflows of €674 million in the nine-month
period ended June 30, 2020, which corresponded to an increase of €1,069 million from cash
outflows from financing activities of €395 million in the same period of fiscal year 2019. Cash
flow improved due to the change in debt and other financing activities, mostly related tofinancing activities of the SGRE segment.
9.9.2.1.4 Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow (the balance of cash flows from operating activities and additions to intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment) in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020improved sharply by €1,117 million to positive €18 million from negative €1,099 million in the
same period of the fiscal year 2019. This change is primarily a result of the positive swing fromcash outflows from operating activities in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 to cashinflows in the same period of the fiscal year 2020 (as described above). From a reportablesegment point of view, this was due to a sharp improvement in both reportable segments, eachposting a positive swing with cash inflows in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, aftercash outflows in the same period of fiscal year 2019, mainly due to cash inflows from a reductionof operating net working capital.
9.9.2.2 Comparison of Cash Flows in the Fiscal Years 2019 and 2018
9.9.2.2.1 Cash Flows From Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities increased from cash inflows of €844 million in the fiscal year
2018 by €850 million to cash inflows of €1,694 million in the fiscal year 2019. This increase was
mainly attributable to the change in operating net working capital which resulted in cash inflowsin the fiscal year 2019 totaling €938 million compared to cash outflows of €245 million in the
fiscal year 2018, and lower cash outflows from income taxes paid (primarily attributable to arefund of income taxes in the fiscal year 2019 from the tax group with Siemens Industrial in theU.S.). Within operating net working capital, the improvements primarily resulted from assetmanagement initiatives of the Gas and Power segment. In total, €1,174 million of the higher
cash inflows year-over-year are attributable to the changes in contract assets and contractliabilities, which were in part offset by increased cash outflows from change in other assets andliabilities due to cash outflows related to restructuring measures. Cash inflows from change inother components of operating net working capital in total remained nearly unchanged whencompared with the fiscal year 2018, as higher cash outflows from inventories in the fiscal year2019 were offset by increased cash inflows from trade and other receivables as well as tradepayables.
9.9.2.2.2 Cash Flows From Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities amounted to cash outflows of €797 million in the fiscal year
2019, which corresponded to an increase in cash outflows of €368 million, or 85.8%, from cash
outflows of €429 million in the fiscal year 2018. This increase in cash outflows from investing
activities resulted mainly from changes in cash flows from the disposal of businesses, net of cashdisposed, which fell from a net cash inflow of €350 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€400 million to a net cash outflow of €50 million in the fiscal year 2019. In the fiscal year 2018,
cash flows from the disposal of businesses, net of cash disposed were unusually high, as SiemensEnergy sold its single-stage and wastewater compressor business and its small steam turbinebusiness, both including service, for €193 million, increasing cash and cash equivalents,
respectively (see “ 9.4.8.2 Disposal of the Single-stage and Wastewater Compressor and Small
Steam Turbines Business ”), and parts of its government business and U.S. Navy service centers for
€174 million in cash and cash equivalents (see “ 9.4.8.3 Disposal of Parts of the Government
Business and U.S. Navy Service Centers ”). Both of these disposals contributed to cash flows from
the disposal of businesses, net of cash disposed in the fiscal year 2018.
180
9.9.2.2.3 Cash Flows From Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities amounted to cash outflows of €1,597 million in the fiscal
year 2019 compared to cash inflows from financing activities of €330 million in the fiscal year
2018. This decrease resulted mainly from a decrease in change in debt and other financingactivities, which turned from cash inflows of €527 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€1,492 million to cash outflows of €965 million. The change in cash flows related to the SGRE
segment’s reduced use of its credit lines to optimize available cash. Other transactions/financingwith Siemens Group changed from cash inflows of €44 million in the fiscal year 2018 to cash
outflows of €367 million in the fiscal year 2019.
9.9.2.2.4 Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow (the balance of cash flows from operating activities and additions to intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment) increased from €80 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€796 million to €876 million in the fiscal year 2019. This change is primarily a result of the
increase of cash flows from operating activities (as described above). On the reportable segmentlevel, this increase was mainly driven by an increase of Free Cash Flow of the Gas and Powersegment, which increased from €212 million in the fiscal year 2018 to €651 million in the fiscal
year 2019, and a decrease in cash outflows in Reconciliation to Combined Financial Statements,which decreased from cash outflows of €504 million in the fiscal year 2018 to cash outflows of
€182 million in the fiscal year 2019. The increased Free Cash Flow of the Gas and Power segment
mainly resulted from improvements of cash inflows of operating net working capital, while thedecrease in cash outflows in Reconciliation to Combined Financial Statements mainly related totax-induced cash outflows, which had a smaller effect in the fiscal year 2019 than in the fiscalyear 2018. This Free Cash Flow development led to a Cash Conversion Rate of 0.8 in the fiscal year2019, compared to 0.1 in the fiscal year 2018.
9.9.2.3 Comparison of Cash Flows in the Fiscal Years 2018 and 2017
9.9.2.3.1 Cash Flows From Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities increased from €686 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€158 million, or 23.0%, to €844 million in the fiscal year 2018. This increase was mainly due to
changes in operating net working capital which resulted in reduced cash outflows in the fiscalyear 2018 totaling €245 million compared to cash outflows of €1,445 million in the fiscal year
2017. Both reportable segments contributed to the improvement with different focuses and withthe higher contribution of the SGRE segment. While the Gas and Power segment reduced cashoutflows year-over-year primarily from contract assets and liabilities, the SGRE segment reducedits cash outflows particularly by a positive cash flow swing from inventories. On that basis, thenegative effects from the decreasing profit development (including the negative impact ofnon-cash income tax expenses) were more than offset.
9.9.2.3.2 Cash Flows From Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities amounted to cash outflows of €429 million in the fiscal year
2018, which corresponded to a decrease in cash outflows of €406 million, or 48.6%, from cash
outflows of €835 million in the fiscal year 2017. This change was mainly driven by the sale of
Siemens Energy’s single-stage and wastewater compressor business and its small steam turbinebusiness, both including service, resulting in cash inflows of €193 million, and parts of its
government business and U.S. Navy service centers resulting in cash inflows of €174 million (see
“9.4.8.2 Disposal of the Single-stage and Wastewater Compressor and Small Steam Turbines
Business ” and “ 9.4.8.3 Disposal of Parts of the Government Business and U.S. Navy Service
Centers ”), which contributed to cash inflows from the disposal of businesses, net of cash disposed
in the fiscal year 2018.
181
9.9.2.3.3 Cash Flows From Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities fell from €1,890 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€1,560 million, or 82.5%, to €330 million in the fiscal year 2018. This decrease resulted mainly
from other transactions/financing with Siemens Group, which fell from cash inflows of€1,868 million in the fiscal year 2017 to cash inflows of €44 million in the fiscal year 2018, due
the change of financing-related balances, primarily related to the partial early termination andrepayment of Dresser-Rand Loans. This decrease was partially offset by change in cash flows fromdebt and other financing activities, which increased from €292 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€235 million, or 80.5%, to €527 million in the fiscal year 2018.
9.9.2.3.4 Free Cash Flow
Free Cash Flow (the balance of cash flows from operating activities and additions to intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment) increased from cash outflows of €121 million in the
fiscal year 2017 to cash inflows of €80 million in the fiscal year 2018. Overall, this change is
mainly due to the increase of cash flows from operating activities (as described above). From areportable segment perspective, Free Cash Flow of the Gas and Power segment fell from€722 million in the fiscal year 2017 to €212 million in the fiscal year 2018, primarily related to
the decreasing profit development, Free Cash Flow of the SGRE segment increased from cashoutflows of €288 million in the fiscal year 2017 to cash inflows of €373 million in the fiscal year
2018. The positive swing at SGRE was mainly due to cash inflows from change in operating networking capital, particularly inventories, as well as strict control of capital expenditures. Cashoutflows from Reconciliation to Combined Financial Statements remained largely stable. ThisFree Cash Flow development led to a Cash Conversion Rate of 0.1 in the fiscal year 2018,compared to (0.1) in the fiscal year 2017.

9.9.3.1 Comparison as of June 30, 2020 and as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017
Operating net working capital substantially decreased from €3,864 million as of September 30,
2019 by €1,280 million, or 33.1%, to €2,584 million as of June 30, 2020. The development was
mainly due to higher advance payments from customers (reflected in significantly increasedcontract liabilities) and a clear reduction of contract assets. A slight inventory build-up andincrease of trade receivables as well as slightly declined trade payables offset the improvementsonly to a minor extent. Both segments contributed to this development.
Operating net working capital decreased from €4,643 million in the fiscal year 2018 by
€779 million, or 16.8%, to €3,864 million in the fiscal year 2019. The development reflects the
success of asset management measures, initiated during the fiscal year 2019. The Gas and Powersegment’s cash initiative started early in the fiscal year 2019. The measures taken led to animprovement of its operating net working capital, mainly by a reduction of overdue accountsreceivable. Also, the SGRE segment strengthened its working capital management with a strongcontrol program with focus on advance payments, payment terms renegotiation and projectexecution, leading to an improvement of its operating net working capital, mainly driven bycontract asset and liabilities and particularly related to project progress and advance payments.
Operating net working capital increased from €4,511 million in the fiscal year 2017 by
€132 million, or 2.9%, to €4,643 million in the fiscal year 2018. Reductions in the SGRE segment
were driven by a substantial reduction of inventory levels as a result of asset managementmeasures taken, mainly due to project progress and sale of finished goods. This improvement wasmore than offset by an increase of operating net working capital in the Gas and Power segmentin the fiscal year 2018, which was driven by higher receivables mainly due to shifted or delayed
184
milestone payments and a reduction in contract liabilities (mainly due to volume decrease,
unfavorable payment conditions and execution of pre-financed projects).
9.9.3.2 Ongoing Programs to Improve Operating Net Working Capital Management
To improve its operating net working capital position, Siemens Energy has ongoing asset
management measures in place, especially in (but not limited to) the Gas and Power segment.Siemens Energy’s asset management initiative commenced in the second half of the fiscal year2019 and was gradually transferred into the full responsibility of the operative business units inMay 2020. Furthermore, additional measures are planned for the fiscal year 2021. In this context,determined operating net working capital targets focus on the reduction of hardware inventorywith low turns and demands in both new unit plants and service warehouses ( e.g., improvement
of forecasting process with external vendors and internal users, development of “Exchangium”platform for offering surplus material to potentially internal/external users). In addition, specialemphasis is given on the stringent reduction of accounts receivables overdue, whilst measures areinitiated to better payment terms in the marketing and selling process (higher advancepayments, strive for cash positive throughout entire contract term) as well as in the procurementprocess (avoidance of discounts, more favorable payment terms). Measures taken aresystematically monitored by newly developed automated tools and harmonized cockpits thathave been adopted to enable maximum transparency and comparability on the development ofoperating net working capital. Operating net working capital numbers are regularly reported toand discussed with the management. Mandatory cash awareness webinars and cash rewardingprojects are contemplated to be available in early fiscal year 2021.
Until the end of the fiscal year 2023 at the latest, in particular for our Gas and Power segment,
we aim for a reduction of its operating net working capital of approximately €1.2 billion,
compared to September 30, 2019. Therefore, we strive for trade receivables, inventories andtrade payables of the Gas and Power segment reaching no more than 19%, 22% and at least11%, respectively, of its revenue, at the end of the fiscal year 2023.
9.9.4 Net Capital Employed
Net capital employed is Siemens Energy’s measure to assess capital intensity of the segments. Its
definition corresponds to the Adjusted EBITA measure except for amortization expenses ofintangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairments which are not partof Adjusted EBITA, however, the related intangible assets are included in the segments’ assets.Segment net capital employed is based on total assets of the Combined Statements of FinancialPosition, primarily excluding financing receivables from Siemens Group, tax related assets andassets of discontinued operations, since the corresponding positions are excluded from AdjustedEBITA. The remaining assets are reduced by non-interest-bearing liabilities other than tax relatedliabilities, e.g., trade payables and contract liabilities, to derive net capital employed. Net capital
employed of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy includes real estate, while real estate of Gasand Power is carried centrally at Real Estate Services.
185
The table below shows a detailed view of the net capital employed of the Gas and Power
segment and the SGRE segment as of June 30, 2020. The figures in the table below are based onthe above mentioned definition of the segment’s Assets as determined by the management.Therefore, by definition, such figures are not to be reconciled for each line item to figurespresented in the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements, but rather arereconciled to Total Assets of Siemens Energy as reported in Note 8 to the Unaudited CondensedCombined Interim Financial Statements.

Additions to other intangible assets primarily relate to capitalized research and development
expenses.
Capital expenditures of the Gas and Power segment, presented as additions to intangible assets
and property, plant & equipment in the Audited Combined Financial Statements, amounted to€317 million in the fiscal year 2019, €343 million in the fiscal year 2018, €315 million in the
fiscal year 2017, and €181 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020. The
investments of Gas and Power were focused on development of new or improvement of existingproducts, enhancing productivity through automation, expansion and replacement of capacitiesand increasing customer proximity via strategic localization of capacity (see “ 9.4.6 Technological
Innovation ”). The largest investment projects were the development of a next generation
product portfolio for future H- and J-class CCPPs and packages, which resulted, among others, inthe development of the new SGT-9000HL turbine model that was brought to market in the fiscalyear 2018 (see “ 9.4.6 Technological Innovation ”), and capital expenditures for manufacturing
and engineering of the casting of turbine blades and vanes via a joint venture.
Capital expenditures of the SGRE segment, presented as additions to intangible assets and
property, plant & equipment in the Audited Combined Financial Statements, amounted to€498 million in the fiscal year 2019, €415 million in the fiscal year 2018 and €476 million in the
fiscal year 2017, and €352 million in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020. The
investments of SGRE were focused on production equipment for new blade types and capacity
188
expansion in its factories. Other investments were related to development of new wind turbine
platforms, logistic and construction tools in the onshore business, and special equipment fortesting and installation of newly launched products in the offshore business (see“9.4.6 Technological Innovation ”). Major investment projects are the onshore blades factory
Tangier, Morocco, and the offshore nacelles factory in Cuxhaven, Germany. The increase ofadditions to other intangible assets since the fiscal year 2017 related to internally generatedtechnology as the SGRE segment reported a continued increase in the capitalized developmentcosts due to the development of new wind turbine models, software and the optimization of thecomponents’ performance.
9.9.5.2 Ongoing and Planned Capital Expenditures
For the fiscal year 2020, we have budgeted capital expenditures in an amount of over
€900 million and expect capital expenditures for intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 3%, and in our fiscal year 2020 to behigher than in the fiscal year 2019. Our capital expenditures were and still are impacted byCOVID-19, which will result, to a certain extent, in shifts to the fiscal year 2021.
In our Gas and Power segment, ongoing material investments are: Continued investments in the segment’s next generation product portfolio for future H- and
J-class gas turbine CCPPs and packages with a cross-divisional focus including all components ofa CCPP and package. These investments are made in Germany and the United States.
 Continued investments in manufacturing and engineering capabilities regarding casting of
turbine blades and vanes via a joint venture, including investments in manufacturing facilities,tooling equipment and the development of IP. The investments are made in the United States.
 Investments in energy assets for independent power production regarding plant projects for a
customer in Brazil in which the Gas and Power segment is acting as a seller, service providerand operator of motors running on diesel and liquefied natural gas (“ LNG)” to generate
electricity for rural areas without connection to Brazil’s national power grid.
 Furthermore, the Gas and Power segment invest in a tooling and repair center in Egypt.In our SGRE segment, ongoing material investments relate to a new manufacturing facility for
wind turbine blades as well as nacelles in France (for more details on the investment, see“12.4.3.2 Manufacturing ”).
Planned capital expenditures for material investments of our Gas and Power segment relate to
the capacity expansion of a manufacturing facility for dry type transformers of the Transmissiondivision in China and the capacity expansion of a facility for the manufacture of electrolyzers ofthe New Energy Business in Germany. In the course of its project business, the Gas and Powersegment also expects to contribute development funding and make equity investments in projectundertakings on a selective basis. In the SGRE segment, planned capital expenditures for materialinvestments primarily relate to the capacity expansion of nacelle assembly facilities for theoffshore business in Taiwan and Le Havre (see “ 12.4.3.2 Manufacturing ”) as well as to product
developments in the offshore business ( e.g., SG 14-222 DD, see “ 12.4.1.3 Offshore Wind
Turbines ”) and the onshore business ( e.g., Siemens Gamesa 5.X Platform, see “ 12.4.1.2.4 Siemens
Gamesa 5.X Platform ”).
Both segments invest in regular maintenance, optimizations and capacity enhancements. Our
SGRE segment is committed to capital expenditures that correspond to a mid-single-digitpercentage of its revenues. Currently, we do not plan any major acquisitions, although we willcontinue to evaluate bolt-on acquisitions.
Capital expenditures for all ongoing and planned investments, including material investments,
have been funded or are intended to be funded from cash flows from operating activities andexisting liquidity, respectively. If necessary, planned capital expenditures may be partly funded bydrawing on credit facilities.
189
9.9.6 Financial Liabilities and Other Financial Commitments
9.9.6.1 Financial LiabilitiesIn the periods presented, the Gas and Power segment was included in Siemens Group’s
intercompany financing, including cash pooling and cash management and will continue to beincluded in such program until Spin-Off Completion. In addition, Siemens Group provided short-and long-term loans (see “ 9.9.1.1.1 Financing Structure Prior to the Spin-Off ”), while Siemens
Energy’s financing from third-party sources mainly relates to the financing of our SGRE segment(as set out in the table below).
Siemens Energy’s (Net Cash) / Net Debt represents total debt (short-term debt and current
maturities of long-term debt plus long-term debt plus payables to Siemens Group from financingactivities) minus total liquidity (cash and cash equivalents plus receivables from Siemens Groupfrom financing activities). Since, until Spin-Off Completion, (Net Cash) / Net Debt of the Gas andPower segment was mainly composed of liabilities to and receivables from the Siemens Group,we believe the historical balances shown in the table below as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and2017 are of limited information for Siemens Energy’s financing structure from a stand-aloneperspective. During the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, certain transactions concerning(Net Cash) / Net Debt and Adjusted (Net Cash) / Net Debt, respectively, have occurred inconnection with the formation as well as future funding of the Siemens Energy Group. Thesetransactions were intended to settle financing balances of entities allocated to the Gas andPower segment with Siemens Group and to provide the Gas and Power segment with anadequate net cash position. We therefore believe figures as of June 30, 2020 are of higherinformation value with regard to our future financing structure. Among the transactions werethe following:
 In January 2020, a contractual trust arrangement (“ CTA”) that acts as the pension trust for
German Group companies to finance their pension obligations was funded with assets ofapproximately €0.9 billion by way of contribution from Siemens (see also below
“9.9.6.2 Pensions and Similar Obligations ”).
 In February 2020, the last outstanding loan of the Dresser-Rand Loans was terminated early
and fully repaid in a nominal equivalent amount of €1,571 million which resulted in other
liabilities to Siemens Group (long-term) of zero as of June 30, 2020.
 Until June 30, 2020, Siemens provided to Siemens Energy for the purpose of achieving the
envisaged capital structure of Siemens Energy Group via clearing accounts approximately€3.4 billion (thereof €3.2 billion in the second quarter of the fiscal year 2020 and another
€0.1 billion in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2020). This capitalization is in addition to
approximately €3.0 billion provided by Siemens with regard to purchase price obligations for
the legal transfer of assets to Siemens Energy which are already included in the CombinedFinancial Statements (see “ 5.2.2 Rest of World Carve-Out ”). The capitalization comprises a sum
in the amount of €0.4 billion which is planned for the implementation of a share buy-back
program of Siemens Energy AG in the near future (a period of presumably six months isenvisaged for the share buy-back) related to a stock-based compensation program. Thecapitalization of €3.4 billion was on a gross basis, hence, before the repayment of various
remaining (short-term) financing arrangements with Siemens existing as of March 31, 2020. Onbalance, the capitalization resulted in sizeable net cash of €2.2 billion as of June 30, 2020 of
Siemens Energy (excluding SGRE business activities), which we believe forms the basis for astrong financing structure of Siemens Energy.
 In addition, Siemens provided funds of €0.2 billion during the second quarter of fiscal year
2020 to fund deferred Carve-Out activities for which the related assets to be acquired are notincluded in our Combined Financial Statements.
 After Spin-Off Completion, then still existing balances with Siemens from the ongoing business
after March 31, 2020 will be offset and settled against cash and cash equivalents, exceptreceivables from Siemens Group of approximately €0.9 billion as of June 30, 2020, relating to
190
certain trade contracts which remain at Siemens and then will be reclassified to trade and
other receivables.
The following table provides an overview of (Net Cash) / Net Debt and Adjusted (Net Cash) / Net
Debt of Siemens Energy as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, and as of June 30, 2020:

With its future financing structure (under a stand-alone perspective), Siemens Energy Group aims
for a balanced capital structure based on the capitalization described above which allows for asolid investment grade rating, so as to ensure sufficient flexibility for ready access to bank andcapital markets, to sustain the ability to repay and service its debt obligations over time, and tobe a reliable long-term partner to its customers. The main performance measure used to assessour capital structure is the Adjusted (Net Cash) / Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio. The ratio indicates theapproximate number of years that would be needed to cover the Adjusted (Net Cash) / Net Debtthrough income from continuing operations, without taking into account interest, taxes,depreciation and amortization. We strive to maintain our solid investment grade rating and donot steer our capital structure according to a specific target ratio. As a general guidance, anAdjusted (Net Cash) / Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio below 1.5 may be considered to be consistentwith the aim of a solid investment grade rating. Our SGRE segment has committed to capitalstructure targets which are fully aligned with our efforts in this regard.

9.9.6.2 Pensions and Similar Obligations
Siemens Energy provides post-employment defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans to
almost all domestic employees and the majority of the foreign employees.
9.9.6.2.1 Defined Benefit Plans
In most countries, our employees historically participated in the Siemens Group pension plans.
For these plans, pension benefits are administered by the Siemens Group. As a result of theCarve-Out, pension assets and obligations relating to the Group’s current and former employeeshave been transferred to separate Group pension plans and, in most countries, separate pensiontrusts or will be transferred in the near future. In Germany, pension obligations towards passiveemployees of the Energy business have not been transferred and will be retained by the SiemensGroup.
As of September 30, 2019, we had defined benefit obligations (“ DBO ”) of€3,310 million, of
which 44.0% related to Germany, 29.4% to the United States and 10.1% to the United Kingdom,while the remaining 16.6% related to certain other countries.
As the majority of the Siemens Energy pension liabilities derives from three major countries,
further information on the pension landscape in these three countries is given below:
Germany – In Germany, the Siemens Group provides pension benefits through the following
plans: BSAV ( Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung ,“BSAV ”), closed legacy plans and
deferred compensation. Siemens Energy has set up a CTA which acts as pension trust (GP Truste.V.). Siemens Energy acts as sole trustor for the BSAV and the closed legacy plans, while forthe deferred compensation plan the participating Group entities are acting as trustors. ThisCTA has been funded with assets that had a fair value of approximately €915 million as at
January 2, 2020. Due to market volatility the fair value of these assets is subject to change.
United States – In the United States, Siemens Energy currently participates in the defined
benefit plans sponsored by Siemens Group, which for the most part have been frozen to newentrants and to future benefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts.Prior to the setup of separate pension plans, the Group participated, amongst others, in theSiemens Pension Plan as the main pension plan for the Siemens Group. A separate pensiontrust for our U.S. entities (the “ Siemens Energy U.S. Trust ”) to which our pension liabilities and
related assets will be transferred from the Siemens trust in the U.S. (the “ Siemens U.S. Trust ”)
is expected to be set up in September 2020. The allocation of the U.S. pension assets currentlyheld by the Siemens U.S. Trust for the Siemens Pension Plan to be transferred to the SiemensEnergy U.S. Trust will be calculated in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 414(l).The calculation can result in a different amount of assets compared to the current assetallocation in the audited combined financial statements. The result of the 414(l) calculation isthe final amount of assets which will be physically transferred to the Siemens Energy U.S. Trustafter it has been set up.
United Kingdom – In the United Kingdom, pension benefits are mainly offered through the VA
Tech U.K. Pension Scheme which transfers to Siemens Energy completely. From April 2013 thetrustee arranged investments in insurance policies covering pensions in payment due tomembers, which significantly reduced the longevity and investment risks for the scheme andprovided additional security for members.

1)As of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the increasing effects of asset ceiling of €0 million, €3 million and €3 million,
respectively, are included. The underfunding of Siemens Energy’s pension plans, calculated as the difference between the DBOand the fair value of plan assets amounted to €1,953 million, as of September 30, 2019.
As of June 30, 2020, the DBO and the fair value of plan assets amounted to €3,380 million
(thereof: Germany €1,473 million, United States €988 million, United Kingdom €328 million
and other countries €591 million) and €2,315 million (thereof: Germany €1,031 million, United
States €617 million, United Kingdom €330 million and other countries €337 million),
respectively. Including the increasing effect of asset ceiling of €1 million, this led to a net
defined benefit balance of €1,067 million. Therefore, as of June 30, 2020, Siemens Energy
posted provisions for pensions and similar obligations of €1,095 million, compared to
€1,960 million as of September 30, 2019. The change is mainly related to the funding of the CTA
in Germany in January 2020. Plans with net assets were recognized in other assets with anamount of €29 million. The estimated assumption for the discount rate was 1.8% and pension-
related interest expense in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 was €44 million.
9.9.6.2.2 Defined Contribution Plans and State Plans
The amount recognized as expense for defined contribution plans amounted to €201 million in
the fiscal year 2019 (fiscal year 2018: €208 million and fiscal year 2017: €233 million).
Contributions to state plans amounted to €431 million in the fiscal year 2019 (fiscal year 2018:
€399 million and fiscal year 2017: €365 million).
9.9.6.2.3 Sensitivity Analysis
Our DBO amounted to €3,310 million as of September 30, 2019 (September 30, 2018:
€2,831 million; September 30, 2017: €2,961 million). The measurement of the DBO depends on
certain actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, rate of compensation increase, rate ofpension progression and mortality rates as further set out in Note 14 to the Audited CombinedFinancial Statements. A one-half-percentage point change in the assumptions for the discountrate, the rate of compensation increase and the rate of pension progression set out in the tablebelow would have resulted in the following increase (decrease) of our DBO:
As of September 30,
(in€million, audited) 2019 2018 2017

Rate of compensation increase ....... 1 7 (15) 16 (15) 14 (13)
Rate of pension progression ......... 7 9 (72) 56 (53) 59 (56)
The effect of a 10% reduction in mortality rates for all beneficiaries would result in an increase
of the DBO of €79 million as of September 30, 2019 (September 30, 2018: €62 million;
September 30, 2017: €71 million).
Sensitivities reflect changes in our DBO solely for the assumption changed. For more information,
see Note 14 to our Audited Combined Financial Statements.
In connection with the Spin-off, Siemens Energy will appoint new providers for mortality tables
in Germany as well as for the discount rates of the main currency zones.

9.9.6.3 Commitments and Contingencies
Siemens Energy issues guarantees of third-party performance, which mainly include performance
bonds and guarantees of advanced payments in a consortium. In the event of non-fulfillment ofcontractual obligations by the consortium partner(s), Siemens Energy will be required to pay upto the agreed-upon maximum amount of €399 million as of June 30, 2020 (September 30, 2019:
€147 million; September 30, 2018: €139 million; September 30, 2017: €145 million). These
agreements typically have terms of up to ten years.
Siemens Energy also issued guarantees for own joint ventures amounting to €144 million as of
September 30, 2019 (September 30, 2018: €135 million; September 30, 2017: €133 million).
Besides the guarantees issued by Siemens Energy described above, Siemens Group issued
collaterals and credit letters in favor of Siemens Energy and Siemens Energy’s investments. Forfurther details, please see Note 17 and Note 26 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements.Under the Master Separation Agreement, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG has agreed with Siemens AGto be jointly and severally liable for certain securities issued or procured by Siemens, includingguarantees. SE Global GmbH & Co. KG upon request shall use commercially reasonable efforts toprocure that Siemens Group Companies are discharged from the above-mentioned Securities.Under the German Contribution Agreement, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG has assumed also vis-à-vis
Siemens AG the obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that SGREdischarges securities granted under a guarantee facility agreement with Siemens and hasassumed joint and several liability towards Siemens AG for SGRE’s payment obligations, inparticular for the payment of due security provision fees, expenses and other costs. See also“18.1.1.1.3(1) Securities issued by banks or the Siemens Group ”.

1)Due to the first time application of IFRS 16 from October 1, 2019 (see “ 9.5 Key Factors Affecting Comparability ”), there is no
longer a distinction between operating and finance leases. All payment obligations from leases with a term of more thantwelve months, were recognized and a separate disclosure of future payment obligations is obsolete (see also Note 1 to theUnaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements).
Total operating rental expense (including operating expenses and service charges for real estate
leasing contracts with Siemens Group) for the year ended September 30, 2019 were €753 million
(September 30, 2018: €879 million, 2017: €815 million).
Siemens Energy is jointly and severally liable and has capital contribution obligations as a partner
in commercial partnerships.
9.10 Disclosure About Market and Other Financial Risks
During the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 and the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020,Siemens Energy managed and controlled its financial risks in accordance with Siemens Grouppolicies. Siemens Energy (except SGRE business) also delegated responsibilities to centralfunctions of Siemens Group. Following Spin-Off Completion, Siemens Energy will manage itsfinancial risks independently from Siemens Group with substantially similar procedures to theprocedures described below. Financial risk management for the SGRE business is separately doneon the level of SGRE.
9.10.1 Market Risk
Increasing market fluctuations may result in significant earnings and cash flow volatility risk for
Siemens Energy. The Siemens Energy business as well as its investment and financing activities are
195
affected particularly by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. In order to optimize
the allocation of financial resources across Siemens Energy’s segments and entities, as well as toachieve its aims, Siemens Energy identifies, analyzes and manages the associated market risks.Siemens Energy seeks to manage and control these risks primarily through its regular operatingand financing activities and uses derivative financial instruments when deemed appropriate.
In order to quantify market risks Siemens Energy utilized a system based on Value at Risk
(“VaR”), which is also used for internal management of Siemens Group Corporate Treasury
activities. The VaR figures are calculated based on historical volatilities and correlations of variousrisk factors, a ten days holding period, and a 99.5% confidence level. This risk measurementapproach might be changed in the future.
Actual results that are included in the Combined Statements of Income or Combined Statements
of Comprehensive Income may differ substantially from VaR figures due to fundamentalconceptual differences. While the Combined Statements of Income and Combined Statements ofComprehensive Income are prepared in accordance with IFRS, the VaR figures are the output of amodel with a purely financial perspective and represent the potential financial loss which will notbe exceeded within ten days with a probability of 99.5%. Although VaR is an important tool formeasuring market risk, the assumptions on which the model is based give rise to some limitationsincluding the following. A ten days holding period assumes that it is possible to dispose of theunderlying positions within this period. This may not be valid during continuing periods ofilliquid markets. A 99.5% confidence level means that there is a 0.5% statistical probability thatlosses could exceed the calculated VaR. The use of historical data as a basis for estimating thestatistic behavior of the relevant markets and finally determining the possible range of thefuture outcomes on the basis of this statistic behavior may not always cover all possible scenarios,especially those of an exceptional nature.
Any market sensitive instruments, including equity and interest bearing investments related to
Siemens Energy pension plans are not included in the following quantitative and qualitativedisclosures.
9.10.2 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
9.10.2.1 Transaction RiskEach Siemens Energy unit conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to
future cash flows denominated in a currency other than its functional currency is exposed to risksfrom changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the ordinary course of business SiemensEnergy entities are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly betweenthe euro, U.S. dollar, British Pound, Danish Krone and Renminbi. Foreign currency exchange rateexposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respectivecurrencies as well as production activities and other contributions along the value chain in thelocal markets.
The operating units are prohibited from borrowing or investing in foreign currencies on a
speculative basis. Financing from Siemens Group or investments of operating units are preferablycarried out in their functional currency or on a hedged basis.
According to the Siemens Group policy, Siemens Energy units (without SGRE) are responsible for
recording, assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. The net foreigncurrency position of Siemens Energy (without SGRE) units serves as a central performancemeasure and has to be hedged within a band of at least 75% but no more than 100%. The futurepolicy of Siemens Energy will deviate from Siemens Group policies to account for SiemensEnergy’s access to hedging transactions in a stand-alone setup, including its rating as a stand-alone Group.
Generally, until Spin-Off Completion the Siemens Energy units (excluding SGRE and Siemens
Energy entities in certain regulated countries, e.g., Brazil, Turkey) concluded and will continue to
conclude their hedging activities with Siemens Group Treasury. Since April 1, 2020, SGRE unitsconclude their hedging activities with external counterparties, only.
196
As of September 30, 2019, the VaR relating to foreign currency exchange rates was €10 million
(September 30, 2018: €9 million, September 30, 2017: €12 million). This VaR was calculated
under consideration of items of the Combined Statement of Financial Position in addition to firmcommitments which are denominated in foreign currencies, as well as foreign currencydenominated cash flows from forecast transactions for the following twelve months.
9.10.2.2 Translation Risk
Many Siemens Energy units are located outside the Eurozone. Because the financial reporting
currency of Siemens Energy is the euro, the financial statements of these subsidiaries aretranslated into euro for the preparation of the Combined Financial Statements. To consider theeffects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is thatinvestments in foreign-based operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous.Effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amountsinto euro are reflected in the Combined Statements of Changes in Invested Equity.
9.10.3 Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This risk arises whenever interest terms offinancial assets and liabilities are different. Siemens Energy’s exposure to the risk of changes inmarket interest rates relates in most parts to financial investments and borrowings to SiemensGroup via Siemens Group Treasury, mainly with fixed rates of interest. Historically, long-termliabilities mainly related to loans with Siemens Group (except SGRE business). SGRE mainly usesexternal sources to finance parts of its operations, with either fixed or variable interest rates.
Siemens Energy (except SGRE business) is mainly financed by Siemens Group Treasury and interest
rate risk management is performed at the level of Siemens Group. Consequently, until theSpin-Off Completion, Siemens Energy (except SGRE business) does not manage its interest raterisk actively. SGRE continuously analyses the split of external financing at variable and fixed ratesto optimize its interest rate risk exposure.
As of September 30, 2019, the VaR relating to the interest rate was €157 million (September 30,
2018: €57 million, September 30, 2017: €123 million). The changes were mainly driven by
changing interest rate volatilities for the US-dollar.
9.10.4 Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk results from Siemens Energy’s inability to meet its financial liabilities. In the periods
presented, Siemens Energy (excluding SGRE) was largely financed by Siemens Group and investedexcess liquidity using Siemens Group’s cash pooling and cash management systems. SiemensEnergy (excluding SGRE) mitigates liquidity risk by the implementation of effective workingcapital and cash management as well as the arrangement of credit facilities with financialinstitutions. SGRE manages liquidity risk independently on the level of SGRE, mainly via bankfinancing, and invests excess liquidity with banks.
197
The following table reflects Siemens Energy’s contractually fixed pay-offs for settlement,
repayments and interest. The disclosed expected undiscounted net cash outflows from derivativefinancial liabilities are determined based on each particular settlement date of an instrument andbased on the earliest date on which Siemens Energy could be required to pay. Cash outflows forfinancial liabilities (including interest) without fixed amount or timing are based on theconditions existing at September 30, 2019:

In the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, and in the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020, loans
from banks mainly related to the financing of our SGRE segment.
9.10.5 Credit Risk
Credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in financial instruments if the contractual partner is
failing to discharge its obligations in full and on time or if the value of collateral declines.
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a
core competency of Siemens Energy’s risk management system. In this context, until Spin-OffCompletion, Siemens Energy is bound to the credit policy implemented by Siemens Group.
Siemens Group maintains a Credit Risk Intelligence Unit to which numerous operating units of
Siemens Energy regularly transfer business partner data as a basis for a centralized rating andcredit limit recommendation process. Due to the identification, quantification and activemanagement of credit risks, credit risk transparency is increased.
Ratings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating
methodologies, with information obtained from customers, external rating agencies, data serviceproviders and credit default experiences. The ratings used consider appropriate forward-lookinginformation significant to the specific financial instrument like expected changes in the obligor’sfinancial position, shareholders, management or operational risks, as well as broader forward-looking information, such as expected macroeconomic, industry-related and competitivedevelopments. A country-specific risk component derived from external country credit ratings isalso considered.
An exposure is considered defaulted if the obligor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit
obligations. A range of internally defined events trigger a default rating, including the openingof bankruptcy proceedings, receivables due past 90 days or a default rating by an external ratingagency.
To analyze and monitor credit risks, Siemens Energy applies various systems and processes. Until
Spin-Off, a main element is a central IT application of Siemens Group that processes data fromoperating units together with rating and default information and calculates an estimate whichmay be used as a basis for individual bad debt provisions. After Spin-Off, Siemens Energy willcontinue to receive such information from Siemens Group under a service level agreement.
198
Additionally, qualitative information is considered, to particularly incorporate latest
developments.
The carrying amount is the maximum exposure to a financial assets’ credit risk. Collateral reduces
the valuation allowance to the extent it mitigates credit risk. Collateral needs to be specific,identifiable and legally enforceable to be taken into account.
As of September 30, 2019, collateral of €97 million (September 30, 2018: €67 million,
September 30, 2017: €35 million) related to financial assets measured at fair value. Those
collaterals are off-setting positions for derivatives providing protection from the risk of acounterparty’s insolvency. As of September 30, 2019, collateral held for financial assets measuredat amortized cost were €333 million (September 30, 2018: €372 million, September 30, 2017:
€283 million), comprising letters of credit, guarantees and credit insurance policies. As of
September 30, 2019, collateral held for contract assets were €14 million (September 30, 2018:
€30 million, September 30, 2017: €0 million), comprising letters of credit (September 30, 2018:
Guarantees).
Trade receivables of Siemens Energy units are generally rated internally; as of September 30,
2019, approximately 38% had an investment grade rating and 62% had a non-investment graderating. Contract assets generally show similar risk characteristics as trade receivables in operatingunits.
Amounts above do not represent economic credit risks, since they neither consider collateral held
nor valuation allowances already recognized.
9.11 Material Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates
See Note 2 of the Audited Combined Financial Statements for a description of material
accounting policies and critical accounting estimates.
9.12 Information from the Audited Unconsolidated Financial Statements
The Audited Unconsolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with the
requirements of German commercial law applicable to business corporations (German GAAP) andcontain a balance sheet as well as an income statement. During the fiscal year endedSeptember 30, 2019, the Company was a dormant company without any business operations.Therefore, the Company’s unconsolidated financial statements for the fiscal year endedSeptember 30, 2019 have limited information value.
In the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded an accumulated loss of €14.9 thousand (fiscal year
2018: €15.7 thousand), mainly due to general administrative expenses related to the
procurement of services such as bookkeeping, IT and the auditing of the unconsolidated financialstatements, which amounted to €14.3 thousand in the fiscal year 2019 (fiscal year 2018: €10.6
thousand). In the fiscal year 2019, other income of €15.7 thousand was fully offset by loss
carryforward. Shareholders’ equity and liabilities amounted to €188.6 thousand as of
September 30, 2019 (as of September 30, 2018: €177.4 thousand). Thereof, shareholders’ equity
amounted to €185.1 thousand as of September 30, 2019 (as of September 30, 2018: €177.3
thousand) and liabilities amounted to €3.4 thousand as of September 30, 2019 (as of
September 30, 2018: €0 thousand).

Siemens Energy business, with the Siemens Energy AG (the “Company”) acting as the ultimateholding company as from the completion of the transfer of shareholdings in entities owned bySiemens AG to the Company (“ Spin-Off Completion ”).
Our forecast for the Group’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items and for the Segment’s
Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items for each of the Group’s two reportable segments Gasand Power (the “ Gas and Power Segment ”) and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (the “ SGRE
Segment ”, and the Gas and Power Segment and the SGRE Segment each a “ Segment ”, and
together the “ Segments ”) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020 (“ fiscal year 2020 ”) and
the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021 (“ fiscal year 2021 ”) (the “ Adjusted EBITA Margin
before Special Items Forecast ”, and together with the explanatory notes, hereinafter collectively
referred to as the “ Profit Forecast ”) is like any forward-looking statement necessarily based on
assumptions and estimates about future events and actions, including management’s assessmentof opportunities and risks. Such assumptions and estimates are inherently subject to significantbusiness, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of whichare beyond our control, and upon assumptions with respect to future business decisions subjectto change.
The Profit Forecast is based on the factors and assumptions made by the Company’s executive
board ( Vorstand )( “Executive Board ”) with respect to the developments of the Group’s Adjusted
EBITA Margin before Special Items and the Segment’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before SpecialItems as set out below. These assumptions relate to (i) factors that are beyond our control andrelated assumptions and (ii) factors that can be influenced by us and related assumptions.Although we believe that these factors and assumptions are reasonable on the date on which theProfit Forecast is prepared, they may be subsequently proved to be inappropriate or incorrect. Ifone or more assumptions prove to be inappropriate or incorrect, the actual Group’s AdjustedEBITA Margin before Special Items and the actual Segment’s Adjusted EBITA Margin beforeSpecial Items for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 may deviate materially from the Profit Forecast.Accordingly, prospective investors should treat this information with caution and should notplace undue reliance in the Profit Forecast.
The key performance indicator described below may not be comparable to other similar titled
measures of other companies, has limitations as analytical measure and should not be consideredin isolation or as substitute for an analysis of the Group’s results as reported under InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards (“ IFRS”):
10.1 Definition of Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items
We use Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items as a key performance indicator as we believe it is
a meaningful measure to evaluate the performanc e of our business activities over time. We
understand that this measure is broadly used by analysts, and investors in assessing our performance.
Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items is used by us as key financial measure to assess the
operating performance of our Segments and the Group. The way we measure Adjusted EBITAMargin before Special Items may not be consistent in the way these measures, similar measuresor measures with similar names are determined by other companies. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITAMargin before Special Items as presented herein may not be comparable to these measures,similar measures or measures with similar names as presented by other companies.
10.1.1 Group’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items
For the purpose of our Profit Forecast, Adjusted EBITA before Special Items for the Group iscalculated as earnings before financial result without financial result from operations, incometaxes, amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired in business combinations andgoodwill impairments as well as Special Items (as defined below) (“ Group’s Adjusted EBITA
before Special Items ”).

1)“Financial result” is defined as the sum of (i) interest income, (ii) interest expenses and (iii) other financial income (expenses),
net.
2)“Financial result from operations” , as subpart of Financial result, is included in Adjusted EBITA. Financial result from
operations refers to interest income related to receivables from customers, from cash allocated to the segments and interestexpenses on payables to suppliers.
3)We use “ Special Items” when we refer to the following items:
(i)Restructuring and integration costs – Restructuring costs refer to personnel measures leading to severance charges,
mainly related to the Gas and Power segment. Integration costs refer to the SGRE segment only and are relatedmainly to the merger of Gamesa and Siemens Wind Power into SGRE S.A. and, to a lesser extent, to the acquisitionof assets from Senvion;
(ii)Stand-alone costs – Stand-alone costs relate to the preparation of our separation from Siemens Group and the
formation of Siemens Energy as an independent enterprise. They relate to the Carve-Out and Spin-Off of SiemensEnergy and include, amongst others, costs for information technology (“ IT”) applications, external service
providers, costs related to the listing, and personnel related costs. For future reporting periods, especiallypersonnel-related costs will be incurred for retention and accelerated vesting of share-based compensation; and
(iii)Strategic portfolio decisions – Major asset impairments and write-downs related to Siemens Energy Group
strategic portfolio decisions.
In the opinion of Siemens Energy’s management, these Special Items affect Adjusted EBITA on
a recurring or non-recurring basis. These Special Items are not a recognized term under IFRS.Special Items are subject to certain discretion in the allocation of various income and expensesand the application of discretion may differ from company to company. Special Items alsoinclude expenses that will recur in future accounting periods. Specifically, we expect furthersignificant personnel related restructuring costs and to a limited extent stand-alone costs inthe coming fiscal years.
The “ Group’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items” is defined as the Group’s Adjusted
EBITA before Special Items divided by revenues of the Group.
10.1.2 Segment’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items
For the purpose of our Profit Forecast, Adjusted EBITA before Special Items for the Segments iscalculated as earnings before financial result without financial result from operations, incometaxes, amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired in business combinations andgoodwill impairments as well as Special Items (“ Segment’s Adjusted EBITA before Special
Items ”).
The following table provides a reconciliation of the Group’s net income (loss) to the Segment’s

The “ Segment’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items ” is defined as the Segment’s
Adjusted EBITA before Special Items divided by the respective Segment’s total revenue.
The Group’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items and each Segment’s Adjusted EBITA
Margin before Special Items are collectively referred to as “ Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special
Items ”.

10.3 Underlying Principles
The Profit Forecast was prepared in accordance with the principles of the Institute of Public
Auditors in Germany ( Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e. V. –“IDW”) in IDW
Accounting Practice Statement: Preparation of Forecasts and Estimates in Accordance with theSpecific Requirements of the Regulation on Prospectuses (IDW AcPS AAB 2.003) ( IDW
Rechnungslegungshinweis: Erstellung von Gewinnprognosen und -schätzungen nach denbesonderen Anforderungen der Prospektverordnung (IDW RH HFA 2.003)).
Although Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items is not an IFRS measure of operating
income, operating performance or liquidity, the Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special ItemsForecast was prepared on the basis of IFRS as adopted by the European Union. With respect tothe accounting policies applied, reference is made to the Notes to the Audited CombinedFinancial Statements as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 ofSiemens Energy and with respect to IFRS 16 – “Leases” applied for the purpose of the ProfitForecast, reference is made to the Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statementsof Siemens Energy as of and for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020.
The Profit Forecast has been prepared solely for the inclusion in this Prospectus for the admission
to trading of the Company’s shares and represents our best estimate as of the date of the ProfitForecast (September 3, 2020). In preparing the Profit Forecast, we have considered a number offactors to take into account the operational and financial performance for the Profit Forecast.The expected development of these factors is based on assumptions made by the Executive Boardwhich are set forth below.
10.4 Factors Beyond Our Control and Related Assumptions
The Profit Forecast is subject to factors beyond our control. These factors, and our assumptionstaken about their impact, are described below and account for the Group, the Gas and PowerSegment and the SGRE Segment:
A) Unforeseen Events such as Force Majeure
We assume that no material unforeseen events will occur that could result in material or lasting
constraints for the ongoing operations of the Group and the Segments, such as force majeure
202
(e.g., fire, floods, hurricanes, storms, earthquakes, war and acts of terror, pirates or a further
pandemic; for COVID-19 please refer to the following section).
B) Economic Development, COVID-19 and Oil Price
Our business operations cover core markets in nearly all countries / regions all over the world.
Changes in economic growth rates in countries or regions might influence the size of ouraddressed markets, and, as a result, our business volume and profitability levels.
We are directly and, through our customers and supply chain, indirectly exposed to global and
local spreads of COVID-19 and the recent oil price developments by impacts on our addressedmarkets as well as by measures aimed at limiting their impact, including restrictions on travel,imposition of quarantines, prolonged closures of workplaces as well as short-time work andsimilar measures, curfews or other social distancing measures. We expect the pandemic andlower oil price level to result in volatility for our addressed markets, in particular with respect tocustomer capital expenditures, supply chain delays and project timing compared to the fiscal year2019. We assume that the oil price will continue to recover, however will still be substantiallybelow the pre-COVID-19 levels in the fiscal year 2020 and the fiscal year 2021. We assume boththe fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to be negatively impacted, however the impact is expected todiffer among our businesses. Especially, due to COVID-19, we expect a negative impact oneconomic growth worldwide. We assume a negative global economic impact for the fiscal year2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 and a recovering global economic situation for the fiscalyear 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020. We assume that there is no second wave of COVID-19or a significant prolongation of the current pandemic leading to comprehensive lockdownmeasures as experienced in the first half of 2020. Due to our business mix, we expect the impactof COVID-19 and oil price on our business to be less than on our addressed markets.
C) Foreign Currency Translation
Our Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items Forecast is based on exchange rate assumptions
and foreign exchange translation from local currency to euro. Based on current forward rates atplanning date, we assume the following most relevant average exchanges rates for the fiscalyears 2020 and 2021:
For the Fiscal Year ended September 30,
2020 2021
U S D/E U R .......................................... 1.12 1.09
D K K/E U R .......................................... 7.46 7.45
G B P/E U R........................................... 0.88 0.90
CNY / EUR. .......................................... 7.87 7.88
D) Foreign Currency Transactions and Hedging
Hedging of foreign currency transaction risks generally follows Siemens AG guidelines and the
Siemens AG hedging approach which enables natural hedges, with anticipation of plannedchanges for the Siemens Energy hedging approach after Spin-Off. We assume higher costs ofhedging related to a different credit rating for Siemens Energy and therefore a negativecontribution to our Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal year 2021 for bothSegments.
Due to Siemens AG ceasing control over Siemens Energy with Spin-Off Completion, significant
hedging positions for the Siemens Energy businesses need to be either terminated and re-hedgedat market-rates with the central Siemens Energy treasury department or novated to the centralSiemens Energy treasury department within a certain period near spin-off date. Based on themarket conditions at the date of the Profit Forecast, we assume no significant costs related to theportfolio transfer and therefore no significant effect on our Adjusted EBITA Margin beforeSpecial Items in the fiscal year 2020 and the fiscal year 2021. Changes to market conditions untilthe transfer and associated valuation differences can lead to a positive or negative impact on theactual costs of transfer and thus our Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items Forecast.
203
E) Geopolitical, Legislative and Other Regulatory Measures
Changes in economic regulations related to monetary and budgetary policy like subsidies, might
influence our Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items. International trade disputes, sanctionsor limitations to market entries might lead to changes in the customer, partner and suppliernetwork and affect negatively our Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items.
For the fiscal year 2020 and for the fiscal year 2021, we assume a stable political environment and
no material changes in the legal and regulatory framework or regulatory actions to which we areor may become subject to, such as support schemes for renewables, tariffs or tax laws. Weassume protective measures due to international trade disputes to remain on the level of thefiscal year 2019. We do not expect to lose our current access to our most relevant markets due tonewly imposed trade barriers in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Furthermore, we assume nosignificant adverse effects resulting from political, legislative and other regulatory matters.Moreover, we assume no significant adverse effects resulting from interpretation of existing ornew tax regulations.
F) Competition and Pricing
Price pressure by customers and competitors are major factors to our business. In our service
business, we see that competitors are increasingly targeting to grow business related to third-party installations, i.e., also Siemens Energy, which might affect our revenues from the installed
base. For selected businesses, we expect a higher price pressure. We assume a negative impact onAdjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared to thefiscal year 2019.
G) Energy Demand
We assume an overall lower electricity and gas consumption for the fiscal year 2020 compared to
the fiscal year 2019, due to the shutdown effects as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. We alsoassume that these effects will partially be compensated by a higher energy demand in the fieldof data center or digital media supply. Overall, we expect a negative impact for our AdjustedEBITA Margin before Special Items Forecast in the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year2019.
For the fiscal year 2021, we expect an increased electricity and gas consumption compared to the
fiscal year 2020 but still slightly below the electricity and gas consumption of the fiscal year 2019due to the expected economic recovery as well as from acceleration in digitalization. Overall, weexpect a slightly negative impact for our Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items Forecast inthe fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2019.
H) Weather Conditions
We assume weather conditions for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 similar to those in the fiscal
year 2019 and therefore no impact on our Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items.
I) Decarbonization and Market Trends
Driven by global climate change, there is a new trend towards environmentally-friendly
technologies. We assume that these market trends are leading to new applications and newbusiness opportunities. To strengthen our decarbonization portfolio, we have laid a focus on newproducts and projects ( e.g., industry greenfield captive power, SF
6-free high-voltage equipment,
utility brownfield transformation for utilities or concepts for fully decarbonized island solutions).Moreover, we built up external partnerships and additional decarbonization specificcompetencies. We assume continuous growth in these new business areas, depending on thefurther development of the energy transition, with a positive contribution to Adjusted EBITAMargin before Special Items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2019.We further assume a positive impact resulting from our wind power portfolio due to a marketshift towards green energy which is expected to positively impact our Adjusted EBITA Marginbefore Special Items Forecast.
204
Increasing decarbonization might redirect parts of the customer’s capital expenditure towards
higher share of renewables (in some of our businesses) and investments in higher efficiencyportfolio of our conventional businesses, limit access to financing of fossil fuels and powergeneration projects, or lead to cancellation of projects. The hydrogen economy offersdecarbonization business opportunities while at the same time we need to invest in respectivetechnologies and business models. In certain conventional businesses, we assume that thesechanges will negatively impact our results and therefore contribute negatively to our AdjustedEBITA Margin before Special Items Forecast compared to the fiscal year 2019.
J) Commodity Prices and Supply of Raw Materials
The Group purchases a broad range of materials, components and parts relating to its
manufacturing activities. Hence, the operating profitability is affected by the volatility andpartially by related price hedging in several raw material prices such as copper, aluminum andzinc.
We assume that the commodity prices of some of the most relevant commodities for the fiscal
years 2020 and 2021 will on average increase as compared to the fiscal year 2019.
We further assume no severe shortages in the supply of our most relevant commodities for the
fiscal years 2020 and 2021 except for temporary shortage due to COVID-19.
K) Workforce
We assume that we will continue to be able to hire the highly qualified personnel we require in
order to ensure that we continue to have adequate technical and operational capabilities ascompared to the fiscal year 2019.
L) IT-System and Licenses
As part of the carve-out several IT-Systems need to be taken over from Siemens AG or are being
newly implemented. New IT-licenses for these systems need to be acquired from various vendors.In the past Siemens AG purchased these licenses centrally and realized large volume rebateswhich we will not be able to realize to this extent. We assume the increased costs for theimplementation of our new IT-systems and the purchase of new licenses leading to a decrease inAdjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items Forecast compared to the fiscal year 2019.
M) Rating and Guarantee Costs
For Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A., Zamudio, Spain, which together with its
consolidated subsidiaries forms our SGRE Segment, we assume that the pricing of bankguarantees remains substantially unchanged. Siemens Energy AG as a stand-alone entity hasbeen awarded a solid investment-grade rating, however, lower than the rating of Siemens AG.Overall, we expect an increase in commissions for bank guarantees and for remaining guaranteesissued by Siemens or under Siemens bank facilities in the lower two-digit basis point area for thefiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2019. Furthermore, due to increasing costs forproject-related guarantees, primarily for guarantees issued by Siemens AG, and therefore acumulative catch-up impact, we assume a negative impact on our Adjusted EBITA Margin beforeSpecial Items for the fiscal year 2020.
N) Partnering
Despite temporary challenges due to COVID-19, we assume no default or liquidity constraints of
any of our partners (including but not limited to Joint Venture Partners, consortium partners,customers and suppliers) at this point in time and that our partners with significant scope areexecuting according to their legal obligations.
O) Insurance
From the first fiscal year after Spin-Off Completion, we assume higher insurance costs for
Siemens Energy (excluding the SGRE Segment) stand-alone programs due to an expected
205
hardened insurance market-environment, loss of joint purchasing power and loss of shared
capacities with Siemens. We assume a negative impact on Adjusted EBITA Margin before SpecialItems for the fiscal year 2021.
P) Equity Investments in Shareholding
We hold interest in minority shareholdings in several entities, from some of which we expect
positive returns to positively impact our Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items primarily inthe fiscal year 2021. Proceeds from those investments depend on the actual performance of therespective entity which is beyond our control and might adversely impact our Adjusted EBITAMargin before Special Items Forecast.
Q) Customer Behavior
We have some projects in our backlog which currently are being re-evaluated with the customers.
We assume a reasonable customer behavior and therefore no negative contribution to AdjustedEBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021.
10.5 Factors That Can Be Influenced By Us and Related Assumptions
In addition to the factors that are beyond our control, the following factors that can beinfluenced by the Company may also affect the defined Adjusted EBITA Margin before SpecialItems Forecast:
10.5.1 Gas and Power Segment
A) Cost ProductivityWe have implemented and will continue to implement several cost efficiency programs to
improve the cost of goods sold ratio and the selling, general and administrative expenses ratiocompared to the fiscal year 2019. Due to COVID-19, we assume a negative impact on AdjustedEBITA Margin before Special Items for the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019. Forthe fiscal year 2021, we assume to achieve the anticipated timing and volume of these costproductivity measures and therefore a positive contribution to Adjusted EBITA Margin beforeSpecial Items compared to the fiscal year 2020.
B) Global Footprint Changes
We have been implementing a series of restructuring programs aimed at optimizing our global
footprint, increasing factory utilization rates compared to the fiscal year 2019, streamlining ourinternal processes, supply chain management, and project execution. Also, we expect to drive theprofitability of the divisions through further cost-out programs, optimizing portfolio andenhancing organizational efficiency. We assume that we reach the anticipated timing and thevolume of these productivity measures and therefore expect the savings from these measures tohave a positive impact on Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items while relatednon-personnel restructuring costs are assumed to have a negative impact on Adjusted EBITAMargin before Special Items, both in the fiscal year 2020 and, to a larger degree, in the fiscal year2021.
C) Supply Chain
We have significant quantitative and qualitative dependencies on key suppliers ( e.g., single
source situation). This could result in a lack of such supplies which could trigger clear additionalcosts due to delays, rework or redesign. Except for the changes described below, we assume nochanges of our cost structure for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 in this respect compared to thefiscal year 2019.
Furthermore, compared to the fiscal year 2019 we assume a moderate increase in purchasing
price for some of our commodities ( e.g., specific products like blades) due to consolidation in the
respective supplier market leading to a negative contribution to our Adjusted EBITA Marginbefore Special Items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021.
206
10.5.2 SGRE Segment
A) Cost ProductivityWe have implemented and continue to implement cost efficiency programs in the fiscal year 2020
to improve productivity compared to the fiscal year 2019. We assume to reach the anticipatedtiming and volume of these productivity measures in the fiscal year 2021. We assume theseprograms to have a positive impact on productivity and will therefore positively contribute toAdjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to the same extent.
B) Global Footprint Changes
We are continuously evaluating our global manufacturing footprint to ensure an efficient and
effective setup, however, also ensuring no significant dependency from certain countries. Localcontent requirements must be taken into account. We assume no changes in impact on ourAdjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items Forecast in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 comparedto the fiscal year 2019.
C) Business Model in India
We are currently reshaping our business model in India to lower future risk exposure. We expect
that the restructuring program will affect our operational business in India and therefore weassume a negative impact on Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal years 2020and 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2019.
D) Manufacturing Quality
Product quality weaknesses resulting from design or manufacturing phase may result in cost
increases during project execution (installation) and following service tenure. Furthermore, thetiming for market entry of new products is decisive for market success and subsequentlyprofitability related. We assume a stable product quality and therefore no changes in impact onAdjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared to thefiscal year 2019.
E) Pricing
Prices for products and subsequently projects may be underestimated during bidding phase in
case of unforeseen events ( e.g., raw material cost increases, supply chain shortages). We assume
no impact on Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021compared to the fiscal year 2019.
F) Supply Chain
For certain supplies we have significant dependencies on key suppliers ( e.g., single-source
situation). This could result in a lack of such supplies which could then trigger significantadditional costs due to delays, rework or redesign. We assume no changes of our cost structureand therefore no changes in impact on Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscalyears 2020 and 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2019.
G) Synergies
We assume first synergies, based on a closer collaboration (e.g., related to procurement and
other opportunities) between the SGRE Segment, the Gas and Power Segment and Siemens AG,to have a positive impact on Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal year 2021compared to the fiscal year 2019.
10.5.3 Group Level
A) Project ExecutionProject execution issues from our side or the side of our partners might result in
non-conformance costs and other project charges. We assume anticipated cost overruns and
207
various anticipated shifts of project milestones which will negatively impact our Adjusted EBITA
Margin before Special Items Forecast for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared to the fiscalyear 2019.
B) Technical and Quality Issues
Products, product groups or solutions – both manufactured and sourced – might face risks
associated with technical or quality failures that we mitigate with appropriate levels of projectcontingencies and warranties. We assume a negative impact on Adjusted EBITA Margin beforeSpecial Items Forecast from technical and quality failures for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021compared to the fiscal year 2019.
C) Equity Investments in Projects
The Group is considering to selectively invest into (energy) projects with potentially not
insignificant amounts. Such equity investments are typically exposed to fluctuations which canimpact the Group’s profits. Such risks are, inter alia, project-specific risks, country risks andcurrency risks. The Group’s profits can also be impacted positively in case such projects performabove expectations. We assume a positive impact on the Adjusted EBITA Margin before SpecialItems from all major equity investments for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021.
D) Employee Incentives
We have implemented and plan to implement several incentive programs including share-based
compensation, retention and share matching program. The estimated costs have been reflectedin our Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items Forecast for the fiscal year 2021. We assume astable base of entitled employees and participants in the plan. Changes to that base could have apositive or negative impact on the Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items.
E) Pensions
The Group’s future costs related to pension plans include estimations of future contributions to
defined contribution plans as well as estimation of future service costs for defined benefit planswith an assumed negative impact on the Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items for thefiscal years 2020 and 2021. In both cases, the actual future costs may deviate from the estimates.Sources for uncertainty may be market volatility ( e.g., changes in discount rates for defined
benefit plans), movements in the participating population or changes in the plan rules, eithercaused by the Company’s decision or required by changes in the respective legislation.
In addition to these direct costs of pension plans, the future costs include estimates of future
indirect costs such as costs of the Company’s pension management function, pension relatedconsulting fees, insolvency protection fees, plan provider costs etc. These indirect costs may alsochange in the future.
F) IT integration Costs
We assume ongoing costs for the integration of our new IT Landscape for the fiscal year 2020.
We assume these costs to increase in the fiscal year 2021 due to a new function setup andtherefore a negative impact on Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items for the fiscal year2021.
G) Rebates by Siemens Group
We assume rebates being granted by Siemens Group for its shared services for the fiscal year
2021. We assume to achieve the agreed volumes and therefore a positive impact on our AdjustedEBITA Margin before Special Items.
H) Margin-related Brand Fee
A margin-related brand fee scheme on staggered royalty basis has been implemented from the
fiscal year 2020 onwards. We assume a negative impact on our Adjusted EBITA Margin before
208
Special Items for the fiscal year 2020 and the fiscal year 2021 due to the brand fee payable under
this royalty scheme.
I) Stand-Alone Function Setup
Preparing Siemens Energy as a stand-alone group requires the setup of certain functions and
capabilities that were provided by Siemens in the past as described above, e.g., related to
corporate activities and governance. Accordingly, we assume certain personnel andnon-personnel costs related to the transfer of those functions and capabilities from Siemens AGto Siemens Energy as well as a need to acquire additional resources to manage the systems andprocesses assumed from Siemens AG during the carve out. This also includes certain corporateservices that Siemens AG will provide and charge to Siemens Energy. We assume that ourAdjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items will be negatively impacted by related costs for thefiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared to 2019. Furthermore, we also assume to drive profitabilityby a potential new functional set-up for which we assume restructuring costs in the fiscal year2021.
J) Acquisitions
We assume no major acquisitions and divestments scheduled at current with an impact on
Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 compared to thefiscal year 2019.
K) Revenue development
The factor revenue growth is a key factor to Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items and
serves the Group and Segments as main planning measure for future business developments.
Revenue Growth Rate for the Group shows the development of our revenue as reported and
shown in our financial statements and Revenue Growth Rate for the Segments shows thedevelopment of our Segment’s reported total revenue. “ Revenue Growth Rate ” is defined as the
percentage change year-over-year which is calculated by dividing the absolute revenuedifference between a base year and the previous period by the previous period revenue. We donot adjust Revenue Growth Rate for potential effects from portfolio transactions and orimplications from currency effects.
We assume Revenue Growth Rates as follows:
Revenue Growth Rate For the Fiscal Year ending September 30,
2020 2021
Group’s Revenue Growth Rate ......................... ( 5 ) %–( 2 ) % 2 %–1 2 %
Segment’s Revenue Growth Rate for the Gas and Power
Segment .......................................... ( 5 ) %–( 3 ) % 2 %–1 1 %
Segment’s Revenue Growth Rate for the SGRE Segment . . . (7)% – (2)% 3% – 12%
(a) Revenue Growth / Development on Gas and Power Level
We assume that our order backlog that has already been booked represents a solid basis for
future revenue generation for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 and that such order backlog isconverted into revenue as anticipated. For our Profit Forecast in the fiscal year 2021 we assume astable development of our transactional business (especially service) compared to the fiscal year2020. We also assume a book-to-bill ratio above 1 for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 andtherefore assume a continued expansion of our order backlog.
We assume that our broad and diverse customer base and installed fleet contributes to the
resilience of our business in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021. We assume no significant shift in ourportfolio mix in the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 and for the fiscal year 2021compared to the fiscal year 2020.
209
For the fiscal year 2020 we assume a moderate revenue decline compared to the fiscal year 2019,
primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts. For the fiscal year 2021, we assume a return to revenuegrowth compared to the fiscal year 2020 due to expected recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
We assume that our existing new unit orders together with our service business form the basis
for our revenue growth in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020. With more than40% revenue contribution, we expect our service business to remain a crucial revenue source inthe Gas and Power Segment.
We do not assume significant impacts on our Revenue Growth in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021
based on short-term deviations of the oil price.
(b) Revenue Growth / Development on SGRE Level
We consider our revenue in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to be highly driven by the conversion
from our existing order backlog, which presents a solid basis for our revenue development. Weassume that such order backlog is converted into revenue as anticipated. We assume that ordergrowth, in particular in the offshore business, supports the revenue development in the fiscalyear 2021. For our Profit Forecast for the fiscal year 2021, we further assume a stabledevelopment of our service and product business for the remaining portion that is not covered bythe already contractually agreed order backlog compared to the fiscal year 2019.
Our revenue sources depend on the SGRE business mix (onshore, offshore and service). For the
fiscal year 2020, we assume an increased onshore and service contribution to our overall slightlydecreased revenue compared to the fiscal year 2019. We expect that all businesses will positivelycontribute to our Revenue Growth in the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020, withoffshore and service being the main driver.
The Revenue Growth Rate is influenced by weather conditions. For the fiscal years 2020 and 2021,
we assume normal weather conditions compared to the average of the last five to ten years andtherefore we assume no impact on our revenue development.
New trends towards environmentally friendly technologies are driven by global climate change.
We assume that these market trends are leading to new applications and new business with apositive impact on our revenue development (in onshore, offshore and service) in the fiscal year2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 and the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020.
Regarding the restructuring of our business model in India, we assume a negative impact to our
revenue development in the fiscal year 2020 and the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year2019 considering latest reduced onshore market development based on market volume andmarket share assumptions. Moreover, we assume an unfavorable impact on our onshore marketdevelopments in Mexico which will negatively impact our revenue development in the fiscal year2020.
Neither a positive nor a negative contribution to the Revenue Growth Rate with regards to
customer behavior is expected as we assume a stable customer behavior ( e.g., project scope
alterations) for the fiscal year 2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 and the fiscal year 2021compared to the fiscal year 2020.
In the fiscal year 2020 we acquired the Senvion Deutschland GmbH as well as the Portuguese
blade factory Ria Blades, S.A. We assume a positive contribution from this acquisition to ourRevenue Growth Rate in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 mainly affecting our service business.
(c) Revenue Growth on Group Level
As we are exposed to global and local spreads of COVID-19 and the recent oil price
developments, project schedules might shift, customer acceptance might be reached at a laterstage or projects are already or might be postponed due to customer’s capital expenditures. Wedo not assume a full market recovery with regards to COVID-19 and the oil price until the end ofthe fiscal year 2021.
210
We do not assume changes in contract options that will affect our contract volumes and
therefore we do not assume an impact on our Revenue Growth Rate. Customers mightrenegotiate prices for existing contracts (especially long-term projects) which might affectrevenues. For selected businesses, we assume a higher price pressure by customers andcompetitors and therefore a negative impact on our Revenue Growth Rate for the fiscal year2020 compared to the fiscal year 2019 and the fiscal year 2021 compared to the fiscal year 2020.
We do not assume an impact on Revenue Growth Rate Forecast from project execution for the
fiscal years 2020 and 2021 due to unpredictable risks and associated changes in plan costs.
We assume no major acquisitions and divestments with an impact on our Revenue Growth Rate
for the remainder of the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, except the once already publicly disclosed(i.e., Senvion).
10.6 Other Explanatory Notes
The Profit Forecast and estimate has been compiled and prepared on a basis which is both:
(a) comparable with the historical financial information of Siemens Energy and (b) consistentwith Siemens Energy AG’s accounting policies.
The Profit Forecast covers results from some extraordinary events or results from non-recurring
operations within the meaning of IDW RH HFA 2.003, such as effects related to the COVID-19pandemic, from a cumulative catch-up impact due to increased costs for project guarantees andthe change of parts of expenses resulting from cost savings programs to the extent not excludedin the Profit Forecast as stated above.
As the Profit Forecast relates to periods that have not ended yet and is based on several
assumptions regarding uncertain future events and actions, it inherently involves considerableuncertainties. As a result of such uncertainties, the actual Group’s Adjusted EBITA Margin beforeSpecial Items and/or each Segment’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items for the fiscalyear 2020 and/or the fiscal year 2021 may deviate from the respective Adjusted EBITA Marginbefore Special Items Forecast, even substantially.
The Profit Forecast was prepared on September 3, 2020.

11 INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
With our Gas and Power segment (including the Transmission, Generation and Industrial
Applications divisions and other operations) and with our SGRE segment, we operate in variousmarkets, mainly relating to the energy sector. As far as we are aware, there are nocomprehensive sources describing the precise markets that Siemens Energy covers with its Gasand Power portfolio. However, there are various government, market research and other publiclyavailable sources, including reports by independent industry publications, covering underlyingmarkets, or individual markets or markets segments, which we consider as part of our ownmarket assessment (see also “4.5 Sources of Market Data and other Information from ThirdParties”). Where market portions relevant to our business are not separately reported in availablemarket reports or the therein reported scope does not match our portfolio, we use our ownproprietary assessments and calculations. The following information on market environment,market developments, market volumes and the competitive situation, in particular the datarelating to our Addressed Transmission Market, our Addressed Generation Market and ourAddressed Industrial Applications Market, as defined in this chapter, represents our aggregationof diverse external and internal data and estimates. The respective definitions and assessmentsfor our Addressed Transmission Market, our Addressed Generation Market and our AddressedIndustrial Applications Market, as defined in this chapter, are largely based on the businessesthat we operate in and the main products, solutions and services that we offer and for which webelieve a market can be reasonably assessed. Our internal market assessments have not beenverified by a third party. The actual market and competitive environment may differ from ourassessment and other market participants or market research companies (which may also use adifferent market definition, product-based split and/or methodology) may have a different view.To the extent not otherwise indicated, the information contained herein with regard to theenvironment, developments, growth rates, trends and competitors in the markets in which weoperate, is based on our assessments. These assessments, in turn, are based in part on ourinternal observations of the market, independent and publicly available market sources. Theinformation on the wind energy market, relevant to the business of our SGRE reporting segment,is largely based on several third-party reports.
In addition, all assessments regarding future developments and trends in the markets described
in this chapter are subject to additional uncertainties relating to the impact of the COVID-19pandemic, a major disruptive factor, and its various related effects: The pandemic createssignificant and uncertain volatility in macroeconomic factors such as the development of grossdomestic product (“ GDP”), oil and natural gas prices, a pronounced decrease in energy demand,
country and customer financial capacity, energy investment, government stimulus and energypolicies, as well as volatility in the financial markets. In turn, these factors are expected to have afurther impact on the market drivers for our business. The above-mentioned factors make ourown and market experts’ projections difficult to assess. Our own market assessments for ourAddressed Transmission Market, our Addressed Generation Market and our Addressed IndustrialApplications Market, as defined in this chapter, are based on our latest comprehensive annualmarket update, which relates to market data compiled as of February/March 2020; these figuresdo not consider the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the most recentdevelopment of oil prices. To the extent relevant information was available, certain qualitativeupdates on expected market development trends were performed thereafter. Similarly, theexternal sources cited in this chapter, including with respect to the wind energy market relevantto the SGRE business, have been published on different dates (as stated in each case) and suchsources have not always published updates to account for later developments, in particular forthe COVID-19 pandemic and related factors mentioned above, or have done so to varyingextents. Unless otherwise stated, statements in the Prospectus based on sources published beforethe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the plummeting of oil prices do not yet consider theimpacts related to these factors. Where sources have published updates based on such majordisruptive factors, they have generally stated that any forward-looking information is subject touncertainties, so that such updates may turn out in hindsight to be inaccurate. The markets mayturn out to be more deeply affected by such disruptive factors (or other disruptive factors which

11.1 Introduction to the Energy Sector
11.1.1 Overview
The energy sector encompasses all industries involved in the supply of energy and therefore plays
a crucial role in infrastructure and the development of societies worldwide. Modern societyconsumes large amounts of different forms of energy ( e.g., fuels, electricity (also referred to as
“power”), heat and hydrogen) supplied by energy systems, which are based on fossil, nuclear orrenewables. These energy systems target an affordable, reliable and sustainable energy supply.
The common goal to limit GHG emissions, against the background of increasing energy demand,
in order to contain global warming has already led to a transition in the energy mix away fromconventional fossil fuels and towards renewables. This change requires the integration ofrenewables and leads to additional complexity of the grid. This transition is accelerated bymegatrends such as globalization and global economic growth, urbanization, demographicchange, climate change and digitalization. These megatrends lead to four importantdevelopments in our markets: demand growth, decarbonization, decentralization anddigitalization. All of these provide opportunities and challenges in our main markets, includingour addressed markets (which are defined and explained later in this chapter).
The developments in the energy markets and related technologies are in intensive public
discussion, strongly linked to climate change and the deployment of renewable technologies. Ona long-term perspective (until 2040), there are significantly divergent views regarding the futuredevelopment of primary energy demand, the fuel mix and the role of fossil fuel in particular.Those views strongly depend on the assumptions taken, often resulting in a considerable gapbetween the committed policy action of governments (in the form of “National DeterminedContributions” (“ NDCs ”) under the Paris Agreement) and the required action to limit global
warming to “well-below 2°C”, as stated in the Paris Agreement as an agreed target.
While there is a wide range of possible long-term developments for primary energy demand in
the “World Energy Outlook 2019” report published by the IEA in November 2019 (“ WEO 2019 ”),
from 1% growth (2018-2040 CAGR) in the Stated Policies Scenario to a decline of 0.3% (2018-2040 CAGR) in the Sustainable Development Scenario, the outlook for electricity demand is muchmore resilient for the two scenarios, with a 2018-2040 CAGR of about 2% growth (for moreinformation on the IEA scenarios, see “ 11.1.3.2 Energy Trends and Transformation of Energy
Markets ”). This gives an indication that the role of electricity is expected to increase in any
scenario and may even develop to become the backbone of energy supply in the foreseeablefuture. It also reflects the fact that the power sector (“power” is used as a synonym of“electricity”), from which about 40% of global carbon emissions originate (41.6% in 2018,according to WEO 2019), is already quite advanced in integrating renewable power generationtechnologies, with renewable sources contributing roughly one quarter to the global electricitygeneration (in Terawatt hours (“ TWh ”); WEO 2019, data for 2018). Wind power, both onshore
and offshore, is taking the leading role within renewables in terms of investments and powergeneration, while PV may show the largest increase in terms of new installations capacity-wise.For other sectors, e.g., the industry, transport or residential sectors, it is much more difficult to
213
integrate renewable technology. The concept of sector coupling (also referred to as “sector
integration”) takes renewable energy from the power sector and brings it to the other sectors;thus, the power sector contributes to decarbonize these other sectors. Examples include the useof dissipative heat from thermal power generation for district heating (Combined Heat andPower, “ CHP”), e-mobility (e-vehicles), but also more innovative technologies such as
“power-to-hydrogen” with electrolysis and re-electrification with fuel cells, both for mobilitysolutions and stationary applications. This underlines the important role of electricity as thebackbone of energy supply in a future decarbonized energy system.
While the integration of renewables in the global electricity system has already reached a level of
approximately 26% of global electricity generation (in TWh; WEO 2019, data for 2018), furtheradditions of renewable power generation capacity need to ensure reliability of supply andaffordability of electricity from a consumer’s perspective. The share of “green” electricity in 2040may range, globally, from 44% in the Stated Policies Scenario to 67% in the SustainableDevelopment Scenario (WEO 2019) (whereby the pace of renewable energy integration isexpected to vary substantially among different countries and regions), with conventional powergeneration capacity to take the balance. This requires the power grid to balance more and moreintermittency of renewable power generated from wind and PV and maintain the power quality(in terms of stability). In general terms, there are two alternatives to match volatile demand andsupply: flexible electricity generation through gas, and storage to match supply with demand.We expect power generation from gas turbines to play an important role to provide dispatchableand reliable power even in a widely decarbonized energy system and to complement theintermittency of renewable power generation. This view is also supported by industry reports:WEO 2019 highlights the importance of considering the potential of future of gas networks todeliver different types of gas in a low emissions future and their role in ensuring energy security.In addition, BNEF expects a 37% rise in combined-cycle gas turbines, as 506 GW could be addeduntil 2050, and a 350% increase in peaking gas plants over the same period, which are expectedto account for over 1 TW of capacity by 2050 (source: BNEF, “New Energy Outlook 2019”,Executive Summary). Having an important role also in a low-carbon energy future, gas turbinesbecome a sustainable investment, operating with natural gas as a fuel today, and with greengases such as hydrogen or synthetic methane in the future.
Energy storage is a prerequisite to build a widely decarbonized energy system. The preferred
storage technology depends on the individual application and storage time, ranging fromseconds to even seasonal storage. Besides battery storage technologies, other forms of energystorage such as mechanical and thermal energy storage may be used. Power-to-hydrogen andwater electrolysis, converting electric energy into hydrogen as a chemical storable energy carrier,may develop into a universal conversion and storage technology (see also“11.1.3.2.2 Decarbonization ”).
To reduce carbon emissions of fossil, biomass or biogas incineration processes, carbon capture
may gain importance, in particular in combination with the development of power-to-hydrogenand the electrolysis technology: Captured carbon dioxide (“ CO
2”) may develop to a valuable
feedstock for synthesis with green hydrogen from electrolysis to produce synthetic hydrocarbons.
There is an intensive discussion about hydrogen as a key element of a future decarbonized
energy system. Hydrogen can be generated from renewable electricity and electrolysis of water,with electrolyzers as a new and developing technology, or can originate from fossil sources.Hydrogen might be compressed, stored and transported in gas pipelines and used as a fuel forheating or power generation with gas turbines or fuel cells.
11.1.2 The Energy Conversion Chain
Within the energy sector, the traditional energy conversion chain can be split into the followingsteps:
 Exploration, transport and refinement of primary energy carriers (see also “ 11.4.1.1 The Value
Chain of the Oil & Gas Industry Relevant to our Industrial Applications Division ”);
214
 Power generation from fossil fuels (like natural gas, fuel oil or coal), nuclear or renewable
sources (see also “ 11.3.1.1 The Power Generation Industry ” and “ 11.5.2 General Market
Characteristics, Trends and Drivers ”);
 Power transmission/distribution via the electricity grid (see also “ 11.2.1.1 Transmission and
Distribution as Part of the Electricity Industry ”); and
 Power consumption by end-users.Each part of the energy value chain has its own specific characteristics, business models and
industry trends, which can differ from country to country. Some companies in the energy sectorare present in only a single part of the value chain, while others cover several parts.
Siemens Energy provides fully integrated products, systems, solutions and services across the
energy value chain of electricity generation and oil & gas and other process industries, as well astransmission. In addition, Siemens Energy holds approximately 67% of the shares in SGRE S.A.,which (together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries) mainly focuses on products (mainly windturbines) and services for the wind energy generation industry. This chapter will focus on themarkets relevant to the businesses relating to Transmission, Generation and IndustrialApplications (including oil & gas, other process industries and the development of a hydrogeneconomy) of our Gas and Power reporting segment, as well as on the market relevant to ourSGRE reporting segment. For more information on Siemens Energy’s Gas and Power and SGREbusiness, see “ 12 Business”.
11.1.3 General Trends in the Energy Sector
11.1.3.1 Global Megatrends
The energy sector is subject to an ongoing transition from conventional generation to a larger
share of renewable energy generation, including topics such as integration of renewables andcomplexity of the grid (see also “ 11.1.3.2 Energy Trends and Transformation of Energy Markets ”).
The following global megatrends are accelerating such transition:
Globalization and Global Economic Growth
Globalization represents a main driver for the growth of international trade (in terms of average
of exports and imports). The global trade volume for goods roughly tripled between 2000 and2019, from approximately USD 6,453 billion in 2000 to approximately USD 18,889 billion in 2019(source: UNCTAD statistics for total trade/merchandise, annual world volumes, 1948-2019database published on UNCTAD’s website). Globalization, including increasing internationaltrade and industrialization as well as an expanding economy, contribute to drive energy demand.
Furthermore, in addition to globalization, a trend towards localization can also be observed in
certain countries, which may translate into local production and local content requirements.
According to a UNCTAD global trade update on “COVID-19 causes international trade to
collapse”, June 11, 2020, the economic and social disruptions brought by COVID-19 are resultingin a substantial decline in trade. The value of international trade in goods has declined by about5% in the first quarter of 2020 and was expected to decline by 27% in the second quarter of 2020as of the date of the report. Assuming persisting uncertainty with respect to the COVID-19pandemic, UNCTAD expects a decline of around 20% for the year 2020.
According to the IMF, as a result of the pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract by
-4.9% in 2020 in terms of real GDP compared to 2019 in a baseline scenario, which assumes aslow recovery path in the second half of 2020 including persistent social distancing, greaterscarring from the larger-than-anticipated hit to activity during lockdown in the first half of 2020and a negative impact on productivity, as well as that the countries where infections havedeclined will not reinstate stringent lockdowns as seen in the first half of 2020 (source: IMF,“World Economic Outlook Update – A Crisis Like No Other, An Uncertain Recovery”, June 2020).The contractions mostly reflects a downturn in consumption growth, which has beendowngraded by the IMF for most economies. According to the same source, the contraction for
215
2020 will be particularly severe in the advanced economies (-8.0%) and less pronounced in the
group of emerging market and developing economies (-3.0%). Under the same scenario, theglobal economy is projected to grow by 5.4% in 2021 as economic activity normalizes, helped bypolicy support and expected stable financial conditions. National and regional economic stimulushave been proposed or put in place to mitigate economic downswings.
Urbanization
Globally, more people live in urban areas than in rural areas, with 55% of the world’s population
residing in urban areas in 2018. The share of urban population is expected to increase to morethan two-thirds (68%) by 2050 (source for all data: United Nations’ “World UrbanizationProspects 2018 – Highlights” report (“ WUP 2018 ”)).
Urbanization is driving demand for food, water and energy in many places across the globe. Over
the coming decades, the WUP 2018 expects that the level of urbanization will increase in allregions, but with considerable variation. In addition, both the level and pace of urbanizationdiffer considerably across income groups, according to the WUP 2018. Sustainable urbanizationrequires, among other measures, that cities provide the necessary infrastructure for energy,transportation and communication (WUP 2018).
Demographic Change
According to the United Nations’ “World Population Prospects 2019 – Highlights” report (“ WPP
2019 ”), the world’s population continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace than at any time since
1950. From an estimated 7.7 billion people worldwide in 2019, the WPP 2019 projection indicatesthat the global population could grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050, and10.9 billion in 2100 (medium-variant scenario).
Another relevant demographic factor relates to the increasing life expectancy. Overall, the WPP
2019 projects that average life expectancy at birth (blended for both sexes, world average) willexceed 77 years in 2050, with regional variations.
A growing population is one of the main factors (together with an expanding global economy)
behind the increase in energy demand. For more information, see “ 11.1.3.2.1 Demand Growth
for Energy and Electricity ”. In addition, continued rapid population growth presents challenges
for sustainable development. The 47 least developed countries are among the world’s fastestgrowing, putting pressure on already strained resources and challenging policies aimed atachieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (“ SDGs ”) (source: WPP 2019).
Climate Change
The “State of the Climate in 2019” report, published August 2020 by the American
Meteorological Society (“ SOTC 2019 ”) provides a detailed update on global climate indicators,
among others, and shows patterns, changes and trends of the global climate system. Accordingto the SOTC 2019, the dominant GHG released into the Earth’s atmosphere – CO
2, methane and
others – continued to increase in 2019. The annual global average CO2concentration at the
Earth’s surface was the highest in the modern instrumental record as well as in ice core recordsdating back 800,000 years. Combined, GHG and several halogenated gases show an increase of45% increase since 1990. In addition, in 2019 sea levels rose to record levels for the eighthconsecutive year, the number of tropical storms was well above the 1981-2010 average andalpine glacier mass continued to decline for the 32
ndconsecutive year (source for all above
statements: SOTC 2019).
In the Paris Agreement agreed in December 2015, 197 parties (196 states plus the European
Union) agreed, among others, to limit global warming to “well below 2°C” above pre-industriallevels and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. The participating countries have bindingemission reduction targets. However, as stated in the “Global warming of 1.5°C” reportpublished by the IPCC on October 8, 2018 (“ IPCC Report ”), without increased and urgent
mitigation ambition in the coming years, leading to a sharp decline in GHG emissions by 2030,
216
global warming will surpass 1.5°C in the following decades, leading to irreversible loss of the
most fragile ecosystems, and crisis after crisis for the most vulnerable people and societies.
Climate change and decarbonization discussions and the commitment to low or zero emission
standards by countries and companies are gaining traction. The IPCC has stated that emissionsmust be cut-down to net zero by around 2050 in order to reach a maximum global warming of1.5°C (source: IPCC Report).
In addition, sustainability and corporate responsibility have become a widespread focus of
attention for companies across different industries, with emission reduction targets, amongothers.
Digitalization
Digitalization opens up new perspectives for businesses regarding integration in a digital
environment and where the use of data becomes important for purposes of reducing costs,increasing revenue and improving service quality and integrating customers and businesspartners in the supply chain.
In addition, large data centers and IT infrastructure consume significant electricity volumes.
According to an HSBC study, data centers were estimated to have used 284 TWh (or around 1.3%of total electricity consumption) in 2017. Data centers’ electricity consumption is expected tomore than double by 2025, to reach 720 TWh, and then more than double again to reach nearly1,700 TWh (or 5.7% of total global electricity usage) by 2030, in both cases under the study’s basescenario (source: HSBC Global Research, “Powering the data revolution – The strains facing globalelectricity”, May 2019).
With digitalization gaining importance, the focus on cybersecurity is also increasing. With respect
to the energy sector, the increasingly complex grids are more prone to cyberattacks, makingcybersecurity a key issue to ensure a secure energy supply. Cybersecurity also plays an importantrole in the area of remote services for power plants.
For information on how digitalization is impacting energy markets, see “ 11.1.3.2.4 Digitalization
in the Energy Markets ” below.
11.1.3.2 Energy Trends and Transformation of Energy Markets
The energy industry is experiencing significant transformation. The traditional power ( i.e.,
electricity) supply model was based on a centralized, conventional electricity generation structure(with dispatchable conventional power plants satisfying power demand) and unidirectional grids(with electricity usually being transmitted from large-scale generators to consumers). Theeconomics of generation technology ensured a stable business for conventional energygeneration companies; in turn, the system ensured constant availability of electricity.
This traditional model is now being challenged at many levels. There are challenges arising from
the rapid deployment of electricity generation from renewables: the world energy supplycontinues to transition towards an affordable, reliable and sustainable model. Due to the verylow cost of most renewable power generation technologies ( e.g., wind, PV and hydro) in many
jurisdictions compared to conventional power generation technologies as well as supportschemes ( e.g., preferential feed-in), conventional power plants increasingly provide only the
balance between power demand and renewable power generation and therefore operate withless operating hours than in the past. The generation mix that is fed to the grid is more volatileand thus driving grid complexity, with a need to ensure regional supply and to balance demand.In addition, gas can play an important role as a transition technology, since it has the advantageof having lower specific CO
2emissions per kilowatt-hour (“ kWh ”) electricity produced in
combined-cycle applications compared to oil or coal as a fuel.
The transformation outlined above is driven by changes in market economics and regulatory
frameworks as well as more engaged customers and competitors, and many new trends in the
217
energy sector are also derived or closely correlated with the megatrends described above. For
example:
Investors are increasingly shifting their capital to sustainable funds, and banks are revising
their policies to limit or avoid financing of conventional power generation projects. Moreover,under an update to the EIB’s energy lending policy, the EIB announced in November 2019 thatit will end financing for fossil fuel energy projects as from the end of 2021. It also set a newemissions performance standard of 250g CO
2per kWh, which acts as an eligibility threshold for
the financing of power generation projects.
Governments and EU bodies are setting new frameworks, led by commitments such as those
included in the Paris Agreement, with many governments setting ambitious targets to cutcarbon emissions and adopt other climate-friendly measures. Moreover, coal-fired power plantsare being phased out in certain countries. In addition, several countries have publishednational hydrogen strategies, including Australia, Switzerland and Germany (see also“11.1.3.2.2 Decarbonization ”).
Companies and industries are making ambitious pledges, for example with respect to
sustainability targets. The “Science-Based Targets Initiative” (“ SBTI”) and “RE100” are two
critical ways through which companies around the world are committing to climate goals.Science-Based Targets provide companies with a clearly defined pathway to sustainable growthby specifying how much and how quickly they need to reduce their GHG emissions. Manyindustrial companies have set ambitious emissions reductions and other environmentally-friendly targets.
 Finally, public opinion is also increasingly pushing the adoption of more ambitious
environmentally-friendly measures, as seen lately with the “Fridays for Future” rallies in manycountries. In addition, customers are increasingly factoring environmental practices ofcompanies into their purchasing decisions.
The transformation, as outlined above, is prompting changes in the industries in which Siemens
Energy is active. Among others, oil & gas companies are striving to reduce their net carbonfootprint and to achieve a carbon-efficient oil & gas production (including attaining nearzero-emissions in the near-term and, in some cases, investing in renewables). Power generationcompanies are switching from coal to gas, supported by low gas prices and increasing carbonprices, or due to regulations, and are also investing in renewables, such as on- and offshore windas well as solar PV. In addition, municipal utilities are investing in decentral energy sources andrenewables as well as energy storage, and focusing on new technologies such as co- ortri-generation (coupling heating, cooling and electricity), flexible solutions to allow for a fastramp-up or ramp-down and mobile solutions. Moreover, grid operators are investing intosolutions addressing the challenges of connecting renewables to the grid and enabling gridstability, such as flexible alternating current transmission systems (“ FACTS ”) and synchronous
condensers, as well as replacing environmentally harmful or conventional assets withenvironmentally-friendly alternatives, such as SF
6-free switchgears.
The IEA’s WEO 2019 analyzes the energy trends and transformation of energy markets in
different scenarios. It should be noted that none of these scenarios constitute a forecast nor canan assessment be made on the likelihood for any of the scenarios. The description on energydemand, electricity generation and other relevant parameters in this chapter is largely based onthe Stated Policies Scenario and the Sustainable Development Scenario:
 The “ Stated Policies Scenario ” (which is the main IEA scenario and was known until the 2018
edition of the IEA’s World Energy Outlook report as “New Policies Scenario”) encompassescurrently announced policy intentions and targets in addition to existing measures. This is ascenario based on the committed policy of governments.
 The “ Sustainable Development Scenario ” is described by the IEA as providing an integrated
strategy to achieve the key energy-related elements of the United Nations SustainableDevelopment agenda, including energy access, air quality and climate objectives, and with the
218
emissions trajectory being fully in line with achieving the long-term objectives of the Paris
Agreement.
There are different measures used in the WEO 2019 and other studies that are relevant. Capacity
additions (expressed in GW) relate to the installation of new power plant capacity and thereforeare relevant for the market development relating to new equipment (defined as products,systems and solutions). Electricity generation (measured in TWh) relates to plant operating hoursand drives the demand for service and maintenance. More operating hours (full-load hours orequivalent full-load hours) typically drive service demand, e.g., demand for replacements of gas
turbine blades. Primary energy supply and final energy consumption are measured in milliontonnes of oil equivalent (“ Mtoe ”), with 1 Mtoe being equivalent to 11.63 TWh.
As the generation mix evolves and renewables gain a larger share of total electricity output, we
see opportunities for conventional generation technology to continue to act as a primary sourceof power generation (though with a decreasing level of installed capacity) as well as contributingto grid stability by acting as a back-up for intermittent renewable sources. Furthermore,conventional power generation plays a vital role in the direct supply of thermal energy ( i.e.,
heat) in district heating networks and for industrial processes in CHPs. We expect thatconventional generation technology will continue to play an important role in the globalelectricity system, ensuring security of supply over the next decades, due to economic limitationsof storage technologies to store energy of intermittent renewables over longer timeframes.
Going forward, in the mid- to long-term, we see a transition of the energy system towards
decarbonization in which renewables will become the main source of cheap electricity andconventional technologies will continue to be important to ensure security of supply. We also seeintegrated and intelligent networks that are able to continuously manage load shift. Sectorcoupling will be required for deep decarbonization and zero-emission energy technologies suchas hydrogen will become important to decarbonize other sectors, such as mobility, industry andresidential, and therefore to achieve climate protection goals.
We view increasing demand for energy and electricity, decarbonization, decentralization and
digitalization as the trends that have the largest impact on our business, as explained below.
11.1.3.2.1 Demand Growth for Energy and Electricity
Primary energy demand and final energy consumption are expected to grow in the medium- to
long-term, despite ongoing increases in energy efficiency. Under the IEA’s Stated PoliciesScenario, global energy demand is expected to increase by around 1% per year (on average) (orroughly a quarter in the aggregate) until 2040. According to the IEA’s WEO 2019, under theSustainable Development Scenario, 33% of global energy demand could come from renewablesin 2040 (compared to 9.7% in 2018), thanks to additional measures to incentivize investment inrenewables-based electricity, biofuels, solar heat, geothermal heat and electrification. See also“11.1.3.2.2 Decarbonization ”.

According to the IEA’s Global Energy Review 2019, April 2020, global energy demand increased
by 0.9% in 2019, which represents less than half the rate of growth in 2018. This decelerationwas due mainly to slower global economic growth and the impact of milder weather on heatingand cooling. There was, however, significant variation across energy sources, with coal showingan absolute decline and renewables a record increase.
The IEA’s “Global Energy Review 2020 – The impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on global energy
demand and CO
2emissions”, April 2020 (the “ IEA Global Energy Review 2020 Report ”), states
that the drastic curtailment of global economic activity and mobility during the first quarter of2020 pushed down global energy demand by 3.8% relative to the first quarter of 2019 as a resultof the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects. If lockdowns last for many months (as of the time ofthe report) and recoveries are slow across much of the world, annual energy demand is expectedto drop by 6% in 2020. If efforts to curb the spread of the virus and restart economies are moresuccessful, the decline in energy demand in 2020 could be limited to under 4%, according to thesame source. However, a rougher restart, disruption to global supply chains and a potentialsecond wave of infections in the second half of the year could curtail growth even further,according to the IEA. Besides the COVID-19 pandemic, other factors contributed to theaforementioned declines in demand, including milder than average weather across most of theNorthern Hemisphere, in particular in the United States.
For the full year 2020, and subject to the already mentioned uncertainties, initial IEA evaluations
indicate that oil demand could drop by 9% across 2020, and coal by 8%. Gas demand could fallmuch further than the 2% drop in the first quarter of 2020 (compared to the first quarter of2019) because of reduced demand in power and industry applications. Renewables demand isexpected to increase in 2020 because of low operating costs and preferential access to manypower systems, as well as driven by recent growth in capacity. The IEA Global Energy Review2020 Report has not specifically revised the IEA’s long-term prospects (including those for energydemand stated at the beginning of this sub-section), so it is unclear to what extent the steepdecline in 2020 and the potential recovery thereafter may affect any of such long-term prospects.
Electricity demand is structurally expected to keep increasing over the coming years. In all IEA
scenarios, electricity accounts for the largest growth in final energy consumption and grows atdouble the pace of final energy demand during the 2018-2040 period (source: WEO 2019). TheIEA sees a 60% increase in electricity demand by 2040 in the Stated Policies Scenario (comparedto 2018), supplied by an increasingly low-carbon generation mix. Electricity’s share in total finalenergy consumption would rise from 19% in 2018 to 24% in 2040 under the Stated Policies
220
Scenario. Electricity would play an even larger role in the Sustainable Development Scenario,
reaching 31% of final energy consumption. In the shorter term, electricity generation wasexpected to grow by 16% between 2018 and 2025 (based on TWh), driven primarily by growingpopulation and the expanding economy as well as increased electrification (source: WEO 2019).
With respect to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IEA states that electricity demand
quickly dropped in 2020 with confinement measures, but steadily recovered as measures weregradually softened. As of the end of June 2020, electricity demand (weather-adjusted) was still10% below pre-lockdown levels in most countries (including in EU countries). In the last week ofJuly, electricity demand was 5% below 2019 levels in EU countries except Italy, while in India,recovery seems faster (source: IEA, “Covid-19 impact on electricity – Statistics report”,August 2020, which includes data until the end of July 2020).
As previously mentioned, of the date of this Prospectus, there is significant uncertainty relating
to the severity of the near-, mid- and long-term adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic onelectricity demand (and more generally, energy demand), for example in terms of negativeeffects on the global economy. For information on our expectations with regard to the effects ofthe COVID-19 pandemic and the oil price drop on our addressed markets for the divisions of ourGas and Power segment, see “ 11.2.2 Market Size, Development and Trends ” (for our
Transmission division), “ 11.3.2 Market Size, Development and Trends ” (for our Generation
division) and “ 11.4.2 Market Size, Development and Trends ” (for our Industrial Applications
division); for our SGRE segment, see “ 11.5.3 Market Size and Development ”.
The WEO 2019 also sees renewables becoming the technology of choice in the electricity markets,
accounting for almost two-thirds of global gross (cumulative) capacity additions (in GW) inelectricity generation until 2040 in the Stated Policies Scenario thanks to factors such as fallingcosts and supportive government policies (source: IEA website, overview on the WEO2019/renewables topic). With respect to conventional generation, gas power plants are expectedto be the preferred dispatchable technology (in terms of global gross (cumulative) capacityadditions (in GW) in electricity generation for the 2018-2040 period under the Stated PoliciesScenario; source: WEO 2019).

The relevance of the different sources of electricity generation varies by region. For example,
according to data included in the IEA’s WEO 2019, coal plays a predominant role in Asia Pacific.Nevertheless, while electricity generation is overall expected to increase in that region, at a 2018-
221
2040 CAGR of 2.7% under the Stated Policies Scenario, or of 2.2% under the Sustainable
Development Scenario, the share of coal is expected to shrink (from approximately 59% of a totalof 12,327 TWh in 2018 down to approximately 40% of a total of 22,245 TWh in 2040 according tothe Stated Policies Scenario, or to approximately 11% of a total of 19,984 TWh in 2040 accordingto Sustainable Development Scenario).
In North America, natural gas accounted for the largest share of total electricity generation in
2018 (with approximately 33%), before coal (25%) and renewables (23%), according to the samesource. Renewables have shown significant growth in the past years in North America, and areexpected to account for 41% of electricity generation in 2040 in that region under the StatedPolicies Scenario (all shares are based in TWh; source: WEO 2019).
According to more current IEA data presented in the IEA Global Energy Review 2019 and 2020
Reports (both, April 2020), in 2019, electricity demand grew at the slowest rate since the financialcrisis, while energy efficiency continued to improve but at levels well below those needed tomeet the United Nations’ SDGs. Energy-related CO
2emissions remained flat as emissions from
electricity generation in advanced economies declined markedly (source: IEA, Global EnergyReview 2019). Also in the first quarter of 2020, electricity demand has been significantly reducedas a result of lockdown measures, with knock-on effects on the electricity mix. Electricity demanddeclined by 20% or more during periods of full lockdown in several countries, as upticks forresidential demand are far outweighed by reductions in commercial and industrial operations.
Electrification is a trend affecting large sectors of the economy. A study published by the World
Economic Forum and prepared in collaboration with Bain & Company, entitled “The Future ofElectricity – New Technologies Transforming the Grid Edge”, March 2017 (“ World Economic
Forum Electricity Report ”), states that, as generation shifts to more renewable sources,
electrification creates further environmental benefits by shifting many end-uses of electricity(e.g., transportation and heating) away from fossil fuel sources, and in many cases electrification
increases energy efficiency. According to the same report, in OECD markets, the most promisingelectrification opportunities are in those segments that are among the largest polluters:transportation, commercial/industrial applications and residential heating.
Electricity is expected to become the central energy carrier, with increased economic activity and
the widespread use of electricity for heat, the emergence of renewable hydrogen and a globalfleet of more than one billion electric vehicles (“ EV”) driving electricity demand growth (source:
IRENA, “How to Transform Energy System and Reduce Carbon Emissions”, April 2019, availablefrom IRENA’s website). According to the same source, IRENA expects that by 2050, 70% ofpassenger road transport, 58% of the building sector and 35% of the industry sector will beelectrified.
11.1.3.2.2 Decarbonization
Global efforts to reduce CO
2emissions and deter climate change have become increasingly
important over the last decades. Decarbonization is acting as a driver for the transformation ofthe energy sector, supported by initiatives such as the Paris Agreement and the IPCC Report, aswell as different initiatives implemented by the European Commission, among many others,which in November 2018 presented its strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern,competitive and climate-neutral economy by 2050. An increasing number of governments aretranslating zero emissions/100% clean energy goals into national strategy and into laws,including Norway, Sweden, France, the United Kingdom and several states within the UnitedStates. Moreover, players in the energy sector, including some of the highest emitting U.S. powerproducers, have set aggressive carbon reduction targets; some energy producers such as Iberdrolaand Enel have signed on to UN targets for “net zero”.
As indicated in the UN Emissions Gap Report 2019, governments must roughly triple their efforts
(i.e., their respective NDCs must be increased) and introduce new measures on an urgent basis to
ensure global warming stays well below 2°C (for the 1.5°C scenario, the original level of ambitionshould be increased around fivefold). The IEA’s Global Energy & CO
2Status Report 2019 (March
2019) states that the coal use in the power sector alone emitted more than 10 gigatons (“ Gt”) of
222
CO2in 2018, making them one of the largest emitters of CO2. The need to reduce the gap
between emissions and climate change targets is prompting changes, including the increase inthe deployment of renewables and the reduction of fossil energy sources. However, we believethat fossil fuels will continue to play a significant role in primary energy demand until 2050,while we expect a shift from oil and coal to gas.
According to the IEA’s “Renewables 2019” report, October 2019 (overview available on IEA’s
website), renewable power installed capacity was set to expand by 1,200 GW between 2019 and2024 (representing a 50% increase in terms of net new installed capacity over such forecastperiod compared with the total installed capacity in 2019), led by solar PV (697 GW increase) andonshore wind (308 GW increase) (representing almost 60% and 25%, respectively, of the totalexpected growth of renewables). On May 20, 2020, the IEA published its “Renewable EnergyMarket Update – Outlook for 2020 and 2021” (“ IEA Renewables 2020 Update Report ”), which
updated in part its October 2019 “Renewables 2019” report in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.According to this report, renewables, while not immune to the COVID-19 crisis, are more resilientthan other fuels. Globally, overall demand for renewables is expected to increase due to their usein the electricity sector, according to the IEA source. Even with end-use electricity demand fallingsignificantly because of lockdown measures, low operating costs and priority access to the grid inmany markets allow renewables to operate at near-full capacity, enabling renewable generationto grow. This increased production is in part due to record-level capacity additions in 2019.However, supply chain disruptions, construction delays and macroeconomic challenges increasethe uncertainty about the total amount of renewable capacity growth in 2020 and 2021:according to the IEA, while renewable capacity additions may decline overall in 2020, themajority of the delayed renewable projects could come online in 2021 and lead to a rebound incapacity additions, so that in 2021 renewable capacity additions would almost reach the level ofthose additions in 2019. For information on the expected development of wind capacityadditions over the next years according to Wood Mackenzie, see “ 11.5.3 Market Size and
Development ”.
According to the IEA Global Energy Review 2020 Report, renewables are the only energy source
likely to experience demand growth across the remainder of 2020, regardless of the length oflockdown or strength of recovery, with an expected increase of about 1% of renewable energydemand compared to 2019 levels; renewable electricity generation is expected to increase bynearly 5%, according to the same source, to reach almost 30% of electricity supply globally.
In the longer-term, under the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario the share of renewable sources in
global electricity installed capacity is expected to rise from 35% in 2018 to 55% in 2040 (source:WEO 2019). In addition, the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to rise toapproximately 44% by 2040 under the same IEA scenario, from 26% in 2018, effectivelyexchanging places with coal (25% in 2040) – even though coal and gas remain the largest andsecond-largest energy source under this scenario in terms of global primary energy demand(source: WEO 2019). With respect to wind energy, cumulated installed wind capacity by 2040under the Stated Policies Scenario is expected to amount to 1,856 GW, or 14% of the totalelectricity generation capacity mix (source: WEO 2019), a sharp increase from the 566 GW (or 8%)generated by wind in 2018. Under the Sustainable Development Scenario of the IEA, renewableswould account for around 80% of capacity additions in all regions until 2040, complementedmainly by nuclear power and carbon capture technologies (source: IEA, WEO 2019 materials onthe IEA’s website). Also under the Sustainable Development Scenario, according to the IEA, theaccumulated wind fleet would be projected to reach 2,930 GW in 2040, or 19% of the totalelectricity generation capacity mix in terms of capacity (source: WEO 2019).
As the share of renewable power production increases, electricity is becoming a less CO
2-intensive
alternative to the fossil energy sources currently prevalent in sectors such as transportation,heating and mobility. This is exemplified by political ambitions for electric mobility.
While pursuing the decarbonization of energy systems, it is important to continue to ensure the
reliability of sustainable energy supply and, at the same time, keep energy prices affordable forhouseholds and businesses, deliver future-proof infrastructure and empower energy users. In a
223
fossil-dominated economy, decarbonization of sectors such as the industrial, power, heating, gas
or mobility sectors was largely conducted separately. To reach the target of net zero CO2-
emissions by mid-century, renewable energy from the power sector needs to be brought to othersectors such as transport, the industrial sector and heating; this process is called “sector coupling”(also referred to as “sector integration”) and is a prerequisite to widely decarbonize energy andto achieve climate targets. Sector coupling takes renewable energy from the power sector toother sectors and can therefore act as a key lever for the decarbonization of all end-user sectors.Sector coupling is also crucial to reach a deep decarbonization of the energy sector. It allows fora higher overall energy efficiency and supports supply and load balancing in cases where a highshare of intermittent renewable energy is fed into the grid.
Sector coupling based on electrolysis, for example, can play an important role in the
decarbonization of energy-intensive industries that are difficult to electrify, as stated in theSector Coupling Study of the European Parliament (November 2018). These industries could use“green” hydrogen (generated from renewable sources) as an energy source and to producechemical feedstock, such as hydrocarbons, alcohols and ammonia. As stated in a report publishedby the IEA on June 2019 entitled “The Future of Hydrogen – Seizing today’s opportunities”(revised version of July 2019) (“ IEA Hydrogen Report ”), hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier that
can be produced, stored, transported and used in many different ways. Therefore, hydrogenoffers possibilities to decarbonize a range of sectors – including long-haul transport, chemicals,and iron and steel – all of which are facing difficulties so far to meaningfully reduce emissions. Itcan also help improve air quality and strengthen energy security. Hydrogen, its derivatives andhydrogen-based fuels can be used to transport energy from renewables over long distances –from regions with abundant solar and wind resources, such as Australia or Latin America, toenergy-hungry cities and regions thousands of kilometers away (source: IEA Hydrogen Report).
According to the IEA, in 2019, hydrogen maintained its unprecedented recent momentum,
awakening keen interest among policy makers. It was a record year for electrolysis capacitybecoming operational, with over 25 MW of electrolyzer capacity coming online and largerprojects announced (in the order of hundreds of MWs that should begin operating in the early2020s). In addition, the fuel cell electric vehicle market almost doubled owing to outstandingexpansion in China, Japan and Korea (source: IEA website, topic Hydrogen (Tracking Report, June2020)). Notable policies in France and Korea, plus high-level co-ordination by Japan, bear witnessto increased government interest. In addition, in June 2020, the German Federal Governmentadopted a “National Hydrogen Strategy”, ultimately aiming at developing industrial-scalehydrogen production plants with a total production capacity of 5 GW until 2030, and a further5 GW until 2035-2040, including a total of €9 billion in government spend until 2030. Global
hydrogen demand could grow from approximately 8 exajoules (“ EJ”) (provided by approximately
56 million metric tons (“ Mt”) of gaseous hydrogen) in 2015 (which represented 1.4% of the
global primary energy demand in 2015) to approximately 78 EJ (provided by approximately 546Mt of gaseous hydrogen) in 2050 (which would represent 12.0% of the projected global primaryenergy demand for 2050) (source for global hydrogen demand: Hydrogen Council, “Hydrogenscaling up – A sustainable pathway for the global energy transition”, November 2017 (“ Hydrogen
Council Report ”), including EJ figures and conversion metrics to Mt; sources for global primary
energy demand in 2015 and projection for 2050: McKinsey, “Global Energy Perspective:Reference Case 2018”, December 2017, and “Global Energy Perspective 2019: Reference Case”,January 2019, respectively). Also IRENA sees a significant potential for “green” hydrogen. In its“Global Renewables Outlook, Edition 2020” study, IRENA expects global “green” hydrogenproduction to increase from around 1.2 Mt (correlating with 0.16 EJ) in 2015-2018 toapproximately 9 Mt (correlating with 1.1 EJ) in 2030 and 25 Mt (correlating with 3 EJ) in 2050, inboth cases under IRENA’s Planned Energy Scenario (which is IRENA’s primary reference case forthis study, based on governments’ current energy plans and other planned targets and policies(as of 2019), including NDCs under the Paris Agreement or any more recent climate and energytargets or plans for a given country). Under IRENA’s Transforming Energy Scenario (whichdescribes an ambitious, yet realistic, energy transformation pathway based largely on renewableenergy sources and steadily improved energy efficiency, on the path to keep the rise in global
224
temperatures to well below 2°C and towards 1.5°C during this century, according to IRENA’s
definition), annual “green” hydrogen production would increase to approximately 25 Mt(correlating with 3 EJ) in 2030 and 160 Mt (correlating with 19 EJ) by 2050.
Market experts also expect significant growth for “green” hydrogen in the shorter-term, from a
cumulative installed electrolyzer capacity of around 250 MW over the 2000-2019 period to a2020-2025 project backlog of 3.2 GW, which represents a capacity of more than twelve times thesize of today’s total installed hydrogen electrolyzer capacity (source: Wood Mackenzie, “Thefuture of green hydrogen”, overview available on Wood Mackenzie’s website).
However, the projections relating to the production and use of hydrogen are subject to a very
high level of uncertainty. According to the IEA Hydrogen Report, widespread use of hydrogen inglobal energy transitions faces several challenges, including a too high cost to produce hydrogenfrom low-carbon energy, whereby according to the IEA, such cost could be considerably reduced,as explained above in the description of the market drivers. Furthermore, the development ofhydrogen infrastructure is slow and thereby limiting widespread adoption, according to the samesource. In its report, the IEA includes several key recommendations to help governments andcompanies to scale up hydrogen to fulfil its long-term potential, including stimulatingcommercial demand for clean hydrogen, supporting R&D to bring down costs, eliminatingunnecessary regulatory barriers and harmonizing standards, among others. Therefore, we expectthat the pace of regulations supporting and promoting hydrogen and other renewable-basedenergy forms, such as synthetic fuels, the extent to which industry players and their customerscommit voluntarily to decarbonization and the economic attractiveness of “green” hydrogen willplay an important role in the market development of green hydrogen and related technologyand equipment, such as hydrogen electrolyzers. An IEA analysis finds that the cost of producinghydrogen from renewable electricity could fall 30% by 2030 as a result of declining costs ofrenewables and the scaling up of hydrogen system production (source: IEA Hydrogen Report). Inaddition, the same source states that fuel cells, refueling equipment and electrolyzers can allbenefit from mass manufacturing. Moreover, the potential increase in prices for CO
2certificates,
as discussed for example in Germany in connection with the government’s climate concept(including, among others, a national CO
2emissions trade for transport and buildings, with an
upper and lower price limit) may result in more attractive economic considerations for greenhydrogen.
Siemens Energy is active in the field of hydrogen with its offering of electrolyzer systems based
on the proton-exchange-membrane (“ PEM”) electrolysis technology (for more information, see
“12.3.4.1 New Energy Business ”). Key competitors include NEL ASA, Oslo (Norway), Hydrogenics
Corporation, Mississauga/Ontario (Canada), McPhy Energy S.A., La Motte Fanjas (France), and ITMPower plc, South Yorkshire (United Kingdom), which are mostly active in Europe and NorthAmerica. In addition, several Chinese players are present in China, but a growing tendency toexpand outside of China.
In addition, to achieve decarbonization, including the climate goals of the Paris Agreement, the
implementation of an international CO
2pricing mechanism could play an important role.
Governments around the world have already collected more than USD 45 billion generated byCO
2pricing systems in 2018 (source: World Bank Group, “State and Trends of Carbon Pricing
2020”), which are being invested in low-carbon infrastructure or used to support technologicaladvances. Also, the private sector is increasingly integrating climate risks and opportunities intotheir long-term strategies and corporate governance. The same World Bank source reports thatabout 1,600 companies have disclosed that they have either implemented an internal CO
2pricing
system or are planning to do so in the next two years.
11.1.3.2.3 Decentralization
The power system is increasingly influenced by distributed energy generation, primarily from the
strong growth in wind turbines and solar PV installations. Distributed energy systems comprisenot just decentral generation, but also local energy storage as well as demand response. Manyconsumers, both households and businesses, have also become producers of electricity which they
225
either consume at the source or feed into the electricity grid. These so-called “prosumers” differ
from classical consumers in their role within the energy system, which has implications for theirexpectations towards energy suppliers, their grid usage patterns, and their potential future rolein balancing supply and demand of electricity.
While we expect centralized generation units to continue to play an important role in the
foreseeable future, we expect the trend towards decentralization to persist.
Decentralization makes customers active elements of the system, but requires significant
coordination and poses new challenges to the electricity grid and the distribution network wherethe broad majority of decentralized systems are connected. Due to more intensive grid usage andincreased feed-in from renewables installations at distribution system operator level, we believethat grid balancing is becoming more challenging and complex, with increasing demand for gridstabilization and with distribution system operators playing a more important role. In addition,the changes will require significant investments and smarter grid infrastructure in the future, asnew and more advance transmission and distribution solutions are required to address thechallenges of a more complex grid. In addition, a study prepared by TenneT and Gasunie statesthat the integration of electricity and gas grids will create new transport and storageopportunities, and highlights the importance of a close collaboration between bothinfrastructures to guarantee the reliability of the energy system amidst increasing fluctuations insolar and wind energy production (source: TenneT, “System integration important for meetingclimate targets”, February 15, 2019).
With respect to storage, projections estimate that demand for energy storage, excluding pumped
hydro, will increase from 400 MWh globally in 2015 to nearly 50 GW hour (“ GWh ”) in 2025, and
that lithium ion batteries (which are expected to make up most of the market) are likely tobecome more economical as significant quantities are developed and deployed for use in electricvehicles, a market where the demand for these batteries could reach 293 GWh by 2025 (source:World Economic Forum Electricity Report). The same source states that, with current projections,utility-scale storage could be a viable alternative to peaker plants ( i.e., such power plants that
generally run only when there is a high demand (peak demand) for electricity) by 2023. Asbattery costs decline, the cost of storage could reach parity with grid power soon – an inflectionpoint after which grid operators will be able to offer the flexibility of peaker plants by tappingthe stored output of renewables.
In addition, demand response creates flexibility by providing price signals (for example, lower
prices at off-peak times) and volume signals – coupled sometimes with financial incentives – toadjust the level of demand and generation resources (consumption, distributed generation andstorage) at strategic times of the day and is, as such, a critical resource for a cost-effectivetransition to a low-carbon electricity system (source: World Economic Forum Electricity Report).Energy policies around the world increasingly acknowledge the importance of demand responseand are beginning to solve the challenges that hinder its full uptake. As more distributed energyresources come online, demand response programs may become even more flexible. Many ofthese programs have targeted commercial and industrial customers. However, new smarterdevices, such as precooling air conditioners or smart refrigerators that can respond to automatedprice signals, as well as the progress of digitalization that is enhancing the technical capabilitiesof aggregation, are helping make demand response programs easier even for residentialcustomers.
According to BNEF, batteries, peakers and dynamic demand shall help wind and solar to reach
more than 80% penetration in some markets by 2050: Around 359 GW of batteries are expectedto be added to the power system by 2050 to help shift excess generation to times when the windis not blowing and sun is not shining. Demand-side flexibility also helps better integrate variablerenewable energy. This includes dynamic EV charging, where vehicles are plugged in when idle,drawing a charge determined by time-of-use tariffs and demand response (source: BNEF, “NewEnergy Outlook 2019”, Executive Summary).
226
11.1.3.2.4 Digitalization in the Energy Markets
Digital technology and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and expectations, coupled
with corresponding regulatory initiatives, are expected to change energy markets fundamentally.Robotic process automation, artificial intelligence agents, blockchain, the Internet of Things andsmart data analytics are just some of the technologies that are expected to both drive the changein the industry and enable utility companies to respond to it (source: Ernst & Young, “DigitalUtilities: From Behind the Curve to Innovation”, October 2017). According to a McKinsey &Company study published in June 2018 entitled “The Digital Utility: New challenges, capabilitiesand opportunities”, June 2018, “ The Digital Utility ”), digitalization provides opportunities across
all stages of the energy value chain, as interconnectivity, data availability and the degree ofautomation continue to increase, as exemplified in the following chart:

As mentioned by The Digital Utility study, a significant proportion of utility assets and operations
have zero tolerance for safety and performance deviations beyond a specific range. Plant-controland grid-management systems, for example, need to be risk proof and predictable. Transformingoperations and systems with digital technologies can create substantial value for utilitycompanies, with a reduction in operating expenses of up to 25%, which can translate into lowerrevenue requirements or higher profits. Performance gains of 20% to 40% in such areas as safety,reliability and regulatory compliance are also achievable, according to the same source.
Benefits of digitalization in the energy markets include making make resource consumption
more efficient, assisting in addressing challenges related to power generation (such as avoidingpower outages in certain developing countries or helping to balance system reserves) andreducing costs in the energy systems, e.g., by reducing operations and maintenance costs,
reducing unplanned outages and downtime, and extending the operational lifetime of assets(source: IEA, “Digitalisation and Energy Technology Report”, November 2017).
The low oil price levels during the last five years have prompted the oil & gas industry to find
innovative ways, including digital solutions, to reduce capital and operating costs. For example,in the upstream business, digital solutions enable remote, and increasingly autonomous,operations which not only reduce the number of personnel offshore, but also the requiredaccommodation facilities on the platform.
227
We also expect digital technologies to transform power generation from the very earliest stages
of the investment life cycle, starting with the design and erection of generation facilities, as wellas with oil & gas and process industries’ applications. In addition, digital tools can enhance theperformance and profitability of power plants or wind power plants, allowing them to respondoptimally to changing conditions on the grid and in the overall power market based on theinteroperability of different assets starting from single turbines up to connected hybrid solutions.Besides predictive or condition-based maintenance, digital tools can track and maintain historicalperformance baselines for individual assets as well as the whole plant, comparing it to real timeperformance monitored on a continuous basis. Any variance from “expected behavior” derivedfrom these baselines or expected operation will trigger an event to allow mitigating actions tofollow if required. Software that uses a machine’s full physical capabilities can adjust operatingparameters in real time to maximize efficiency and minimize cost. In turn, as the plant operatesmore efficiently, the plant’s environmental footprint improves.
Furthermore, certain companies (including Siemens Energy) are developing increasingly advanced
concepts for autonomous power plant operations in which the plant is always digitally connectedand in operation. Software-based monitoring and control of facilities also enable aspects ofenergy production to be largely automated.
With the upcoming further expansion of renewables, current energy systems will be facing high
levels of volatility Digital technology is creating new opportunities to couple the many differentelements of the energy landscape – even across sectors – and optimally exploit the advantages ofeach. Flexible dispatchable power generation and digitalization of transmission and distributiongrids help to balance intermittent renewable power generation and the demand side.
The growing amount of distributed generators and storages in the electricity system presents
operational challenges for grid operators. They may cause rapid voltage fluctuation, createbi-directional flows, or adversely affect transformer and other grid asset lifetimes. Software canhelp to automatically monitor and manage these distributed assets. As stated in the WorldEconomic Forum Electricity Report, digital technologies increasingly allow devices across the gridto communicate and provide data useful for grid management and operation. Sensors, networkremote control and automation systems as well as digital platforms that focus on optimizationand aggregation, allow for real-time operation of the network and its connected resources andcollect network data to improve situational awareness and utility services. Data hubs allow theanalysis of sensor data from substations, feeders and connected devices in order to identify gridareas that may be at their capacity limit or experiencing volatile demand or power quality issues.
In addition, companies in the energy and other sectors are stepping-up their initiatives to address
the challenges posed by cybersecurity. In customers’ review of the offer documents submitted aspart of a project bid, the specific measures to prevent cyberattacks on the part of suppliers playan increasingly important role. Major players in the energy sectors, such as Siemens Energy, aretherefore adopting a proactive role to tackle cybersecurity issues. For example, at the MunichSecurity Conference 2018, Siemens and eight partners from the industry signed the first jointcharter for greater cybersecurity. Initiated by Siemens, the “Charter of Trust” calls for bindingrules and standards to build trust in cybersecurity and further advance digitalization. The Charterof Trust has currently 17 members, including large corporates as signatories (such as Airbus,Allianz, Cisco, Dell, IBM, Deutsche Telekom, Total and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, amongothers), as well as some associate members. Following the Spin-Off, Siemens Energy will initiallybe an indirect partner.
11.2 The Addressed Transmission Market
11.2.1 Introduction; Definitions and Methodology
Our Transmission division offers products as well as related solutions and services mainly for grid
operators ( e.g., Transmission System Operators (“ TSOs ”) and Distribution System Operators
(“DSOs ”)) as well as industrial and infrastructure customers. Our portfolio ranges from products
and systems (mainly switchgear, transformers and high-voltage components) over substation andpower electronic solutions for managing complexity in power grids and increasing grid stability,
228
to a broad range of maintenance, modernization and digital services. For more information on
our Transmission portfolio, see “ 12.3.1 Transmission Division ”.
Transmission provides the backbone of any electricity infrastructure. Historically, this
infrastructure was designed to transmit power across large distances at high voltages usingalternating current (“ AC”) technology and to distribute the electricity at lower currents (medium
or low voltages) to the end-user. The rapid proliferation of renewables (which need to beintegrated into the grid) and the trend towards decarbonization, together with the arrival ofprosumers and the liberalization of electricity markets, require more complex solutions, includingthe integration of direct current (“ DC”) infrastructure into existing AC infrastructure. To
maintain availability of these complex grids and to optimize grid usage, higher levels ofdigitalization are required, as well as new technologies and more environmentally-friendlyproducts to contribute to decarbonization, all of which will open new business opportunities. Inaddition, the increasing complexity of grids is resulting in significant upgrade requirements forthe related infrastructure, which is also a driver for our Addressed Transmission Market (asdefined and assessed by us; see “ 11.2.1.2 Market Definitions and Methodology” ). We also believe
that the Addressed Transmission Market will benefit from general megatrends such asurbanization and electrification, which are expected to increase electricity demand (in particularas developing countries are investing to achieve complete electrification coverage for theirpopulations).
11.2.1.1 Transmission and Distribution as Part of the Electricity Industry
In the electricity industry, grid operators mainly provide and operate the infrastructure to
connect power generating units, such as centralized power plants and decentralized renewables,to consumers and prosumers. The electricity grid may consist of up to five different voltage levels(depending on the country) with different functionalities, connected mainly via substations.

Note: Various countries have slightly different definitions of voltage levels; the definitions may also vary among market
participants.
Transmission refers to the transportation of electricity over ultra- and extra-high voltage lines (in
some countries also high voltage lines), from central power generation units, such as powerplants or large renewable plants, to local distribution networks, as well as industrial companieswho are directly connected to the transmission network.
One or more TSOs in a respective country own and/or operate AC and DC transmission assets such
as transmission lines, power cables, AC substations, transformers, interconnector and AC/DCconverter stations. The main task of the TSOs is to ensure the transport of electricity and tosecure the system’s stability and availability. Transmission also involves the transportation ofelectricity between different jurisdictions, such as states or countries. For example, in NorthAmerica, this role is typically fulfilled by regional transmission organizations (“ RTOs ”) and
independent system operators (“ ISOs”).
Low, medium and high voltage layers of the grid are operated and maintained by the respective
DSO. DSOs usually distribute electricity to customers in a particular municipality or geographicarea and may also supply electricity to other DSOs. DSOs own and operate distribution assetssuch as distribution stations, transformers, switchgear, distribution cables as well as overheadlines, masts, poles and switches, and use telecommunication lines to control the distribution gridto support system operation, smart metering and smart grid systems. In some countries, DSOs arefurther responsible for metering operations.
The main task of the DSOs is the operation of the distribution grid, which allows distribution of
power from TSOs/DSOs or small and medium-sized power producers to customers, including theintegration of distributed (renewable) energy sources into the system and the management ofelectricity demand.
Originally, the transmission and distribution systems were built to transport and distribute
electricity produced mostly in centralized generating units with transformation from the highestvoltage layer through the different layers to the customer in the low voltage layer(unidirectional). However, due to the steady growth of distributed/decentralized energy sourcesin recent years, particularly for renewables, power producers are now not only connected to thehighest voltage layer, but also to the lower voltage layers up to 230 kV in several countries. As aresult, the power flow in the grid has become in some cases bidirectional and, therefore, morecomplex (see “ 11.1.3.2.3 Decentralization ”), resulting in significant upgrade requirements for the
related infrastructure.

11.2.1.2 Market Definitions and Methodology
We assess our “ Addressed Transmission Market ” based on the business mandate of our
Transmission division. The business mandate is defined by the market potential we assess for ourTransmission business (see “ 12.3.1 Transmission Division ”). Conversely, segments and categories
that are currently not part of our business have been left aside for purposes of defining ourAddressed Transmission Market. Our Addressed Transmission Market is the main market for us,since it is most relevant to us in terms of attractiveness, growth and market share development.
The following chart provides an overview of how we derive our Addressed Transmission Market
from other markets and categories:

Note: The bars in the chart above are intended only to provide an overview of the methodology regarding our Addressed
Transmission Market and the size of the bars does not represent precise values nor precise relative values among thedifferent markets and categories shown.
The Addressed Transmission Market is somewhat broader than the market which is currently
directly accessible to our transmission business. The Addressed Transmission Market includes, forexample, various regional markets which we cannot serve or participate in due to legalrestrictions (such as export restrictions) or due to self-imposed restrictions of the Siemens Energyorganization with respect to individual countries or customers, or due to missing localmanufacturing or sales footprint, or due to lack of fulfillment of local content requirements.
We refer to the market segments that are adjacent to our Addressed Transmission Market (which
are therefore not part of our current portfolio) as the “ unaddressed transmission market ”. The
unaddressed transmission market includes categories such as overhead lines (including towers),high-voltage underground cables (>60 kV to <230 kV), extra-high voltage underground cables(>230 kV) and submarine cables (both high and extra-high voltage).
We refer to the sum of our Addressed Transmission Market and the unaddressed transmission
market as the “ entire transmission market ”. In addition, there are grid investments, internal
activities and internal spending of transmission market participants, such as in-house services,e.g., in-house engineering, integration and maintenance services, which are added to the entire
transmission market to assess the “ entire investment ” for the transmission market. Other market
participants or market research companies may use different market definitions and thereforesimilarly termed markets or market segments assessed by third parties may not be comparable toour own market assessment.
Within our Addressed Transmission Market, we differentiate between the following market
segments by business type , namely:
Transmission Products and Systems , comprising air-insulated switchgear, gas-insulated
switchgear (including both conventional (SF
6) and environmentally-friendly (SF6-free)
switchgear), power transformers, distribution transformers, bushings, instrument transformersand coil products as well as other transformers (such as reactors, phase-shifting transformers
231
and HVDC transformers, as well as special transformers for industrial applications, grid
resiliency applications and mobile transformers (“plug-and-play”) and traction powertransformers used in railway applications).
Transmission Solutions , including turnkey substations, portable power solutions ( e.g., “plug
and play” switching stations), flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS), high-and medium-voltage DC transmission systems as well as grid access and connection solutionsfor decentralized generating units and remote loads.
Transmission Services , such as field and maintenance, repair and emergency services,
modernization and retrofit services, digital services, training and support as well as operationand long-term programs. In our market assessment, we include all services for the totalinstalled fleet of transmission assets (whether the fleet relates to our own products andsolutions or those of competitors, and regardless of whether we or another OEM provides theservices).
From a geographic perspective , we also analyze our Addressed Transmission Market split into the
following regions (along our reporting regions):
 the Americas: Canada, the United States as well as Middle and South America, EMEA: Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States ( i.e., Russia and eight further
member states), the Middle East and Africa, and
 Asia, Australia: Asia, Australia and New Zealand.To assess our Addressed Transmission Market, we use our own market analysis, which includes
both a top-down assessment, which considers certain macroeconomic indicators relevant to ourmarkets based on a variety of third-party sources, and a bottom-up analysis of the global pipelinefor all projects relating to the abovementioned product, solutions and service categories(regardless of whether a project is awarded or expected to be awarded to Siemens Energy ornot). Examples of such third-party sources flowing into our top-down analysis are the reports anddatabases compiled by Global Data plc, London (United Kingdom), IHS Markit’s Global Insightdatabase, in particular for the analysis of economical and country-related risks, the reportspublished by Global Transmission, based in New Delhi (India) (such as the “Global TransmissionInvestment Report”), and reports and further data from the IEA, among others. In addition, weuse our understanding of the industry, customer investment plans and our own database of theproject pipeline (which we compile using, among others, tender information, press releases andother documents published by competitors, industry publications and our own marketintelligence).
The size assessment for each of the different market segments of our Addressed Transmission
Market (in terms of value) is based, with respect to the project business, on projects awardedwith respect to such market segment ( i.e., overall order intake) or, for future periods, on the
expected project awards. This means that the complete value of each new order is allocated tothe period in which the order is awarded. In the project business, due to long execution duration,revenues may lag a few years behind (typically three to five years) with respect to the time of theorder award. The product business is another important sales channel. Through this channel,individual products are sold separately from a project, directly to a customer or end-user, eitherbecause the customer itself separates such product scope from the project, or due to demandrelating to product refurbishment or replacement requirements. In such cases, the value isallocated only to the Transmission Products and Systems market segment of our AddressedTransmission Market for assessment purposes. The allocation of order intake/order award valuesto a certain country (and therefore, to a certain region, as mentioned above) depends, for themost part, on the country in which the final customer is located and in which the installationtakes place.
In addition, we apply a principle of market value consolidation to eliminate double counting.
Certain products sold are later integrated by our other business divisions within Siemens Energyinto a system or solution, who then install such products for a customer. Without the
232
consolidation principle, order intake for such products would be taken into account more than
once, with each new order relating to them. Similarly, the consolidation principle allows toeliminate double-counting in cases of intra-group sales of products, systems, etc. that are thensold to a third party.
Market sizes (including estimated future market sizes) are calculated in euro based on the
end-customer price. Foreign currency amounts for the fiscal year 2019 (and any other historicperiods) are converted into €using exchange rates for the respective fiscal year. Projection
figures relating to the current fiscal year and any future fiscal years ( e.g., for the fiscal year 2025,
as shown in the table further below) are calculated taking into consideration (i) a projectedforeign exchange rate (in the case of the figures shown in this chapter, the foreign exchangerates for March 3, 2020 have been used as projected rates for the respective foreign currenciesover the complete forecast period) and (ii) projected general capital cost effects.
We have calculated market positions and other statements relating to our competitive
environment taking into account order intake. It must be noted that for Transmission Solutionsand Transmission Services, the inherent volatility relating to large awarded projects in a givenyear may result in changes in the market position among the major players from one year toanother.

For the coming years until 2025, based on our own assessment, we expect slight growth in our
Addressed Transmission Market, with strong absolute contribution from mature regions. Whilewe see China still as the largest single country in terms of absolute value, we expect a slowdownover the 2019-2025 period in that country, resulting in a moderate growth in Asia overall. In Asiaexcluding China and the Middle East we expect the highest growth rates. For North America weexpect a high growth rate coming from the integration of renewables, while for Europe andAfrica we expect a flat development.
All figures shown in this section have been assessed prior to a consideration of the potential
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since electricity grids are part of countries’ critical
233
infrastructure, we currently expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a moderate impact on
our Addressed Transmission Market. We expect some volatility in drivers such as the financialstrength of customers and their willingness to invest as well as regarding project timing(including potential shifts of orders for projects delayed due to the effects of the pandemic tosubsequent fiscal years). We currently assume a peak near-term negative impact on ourAddressed Transmission Market in a single-digit percentage level for 2020-2021. Certain countries(e.g., in Latin America and/or the Middle East) that are heavily dependent on income from oil &
gas and related commodities may curtail investments in capital-intensive transmission projectsduring periods of low oil & gas prices. In the longer-term, in particular with respect to the 2025figures, we currently expect the COVID-19 pandemic would have a significantly less profoundimpact on market developments. However, uncertainties remain at this time, for example asregards the timing and magnitude of the potential impact, so that actual market developmentsmay turn out to be different from those mentioned in this section.
Growth in renewables, industrial activity and infrastructure is contributing to growth in the
entire transmission market as well as in our Addressed Transmission Market. In addition, globaland regional interconnections are generating further opportunities. We also believe that theAddressed Transmission Market will benefit from megatrends such as urbanization (see“11.1.3.1 Global Megatrends ”) and electrification (see “ 11.1.3.2.1 Demand Growth for Energy
and Electricity ”), which are expected to increase electricity demand, as well as from renewable
energy integration, new technologies, digitalization and more environmentally-friendly productsthat are increasingly in focus to optimize the usage of grids and to reduce the carbon footprint.
We expect that growth in our Addressed Transmission Market over the next few years shall be
driven, in particular, by the following factors and trends:
Load Growth
Expanding economies and rising demand for power, mainly in developing countries, are fueling
the demand for power transmission networks. These countries are also investing in order toachieve complete electrification coverage for their populations. In addition, growth intransmission technologies is directly related to large-scale sector coupling, e.g., the increase of
green hydrogen production in countries with cheap electricity from renewable sources. Thus,sector coupling, although not directly driving electricity consumption, is contributing to driveload growth.
In particular, we believe that Asian electricity markets (except for China) will significantly expand
in the coming years, which would require more investment in their respective power transmissionsectors. Providing access to electricity to growing populations and meeting increase in loads areamong the key investment drivers for the growth of the electricity infrastructure in Africa andthe Middle East. In addition, many Latin American countries are supporting each other inmeeting the rising power demand ( e.g., with the creation of common inter-country
infrastructure to share energy demand and supply) and in improving the domestic electrificationrate through power exchange.
Connecting Renewable Energy
In light of rising concerns regarding environmental impact, many countries around the globe are
investing in renewables to generate power. Establishing a reliable connection for the powerproduced in these clean energy projects to the grids is one of the key drivers for investment inpower transmission.
In Europe, the majority of the transmission projects are currently focused on connecting onshore
and offshore wind power projects to the grid. Offshore wind power plants are also gainingmomentum in the United States and China. Furthermore, both the United States and Canada aredeveloping several interconnections to transfer low-cost hydro power from Canada into theUnited States. In Latin America, the focus is currently on developing large-scale hydropowerprojects.
234
In addition, backed by the prospects of selling electricity to Europe, North African countries have
developed far-reaching plans to utilize Africa’s high renewable energy potential and invest inassociated transmission infrastructure (source: Global Transmission Report website, release datedJuly 7, 2017, “Africa’s Transmission Sector: Private investments vital to drive growth”).
The high integration of renewables is also leading to the adoption of new technologies due to
increased complexities, not only for transmitting power, owing to their intermittent powergeneration, but also for energy storage. At times, there is a lack of reliable transmission of real-time data to deal with the issue of intermittent power generation characteristics of renewableenergy projects, sometimes also due to their remote location. Energy storage technologies enableintermittent renewables to be successfully integrated into the grid. They also increase theefficiency of existing power generation and transmission facilities and improve the quality ofelectricity supply. With substantial renewable energy mandates in place, several Europeancountries, the United States and China are currently heavily investing in grid-scale energy storageprojects.
Technology Improvements
New technologies are being deployed to integrate renewables and to expand and modernize the
existing transmission grid. Besides high voltage AC (“ HVAC ”), HVDC technologies are currently
the preferred option for the integration of large onshore and offshore renewable energyresources, mainly in the United States and Europe. For example, the IEEE states that a HVDC gridwould serve as the basic transmission technology for the envisioned European “supergrid”, a keycomponent in securing a stable, cost-effective and reliable energy supply (source: IEEE, “HVDCGrids for the European Transmission System: Accelerating the Large-Scale Integration ofRenewables – An IEEE European Public Policy Initiative Position Statement”, adopted onSeptember 1, 2017).
Along with HVAC and HVDC overhead lines, countries like India, China and Brazil are also
developing ultra-high voltage grids and extra-high voltage grids.
The integration of renewable power plants and shut down of conventional fossil and nuclear
power plants is leading to decreases of voltage and frequency stability, unbalanced load flows,congestions, short-circuit current levels change, inefficiency and re-dispatch. To meet these newchallenges, the importance of the flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) isincreasing. New technologies using static VAR compensators (which provide fast-acting reactivepower on high-voltage electricity transmission networks), also with frequency stabilizers, loadflow controllers, synchronous condensers and medium voltage DC interconnections will likelybecome integral parts of future power grids.
Another key trend in the transmission industry has been the increase in the use of underground
cables. While underground cables with voltage levels up to 150 kV have been an option incongested cities and towns for some time, high-voltage cables are being deployed only in caseswhere there has been very strong public opposition to overhead lines and only for short distancesdue to their high cost.
Advanced technologies are also being developed for transmission substations to improve their
efficiency and reduce their impact on the environment. Utilities and other industrial players arenow becoming aware of the benefits of introducing digitalization and environmentally-friendlyproducts into their transmission and distribution networks. Pilots are being undertaken, mainly inEurope but also increasingly in the United States, to use digitally enabled SF
6-free switchgear and
ester oil-filled transformers in order to improve productivity, performance and operational safetyas well as to reduce unplanned downtime and GHG, thus addressing environmental concerns.
Aging Infrastructure
Many developed countries are also investing in improving their aged power infrastructure with
new and advanced technologies. These mainly include the United States and European countries,where the power transmission network development begun in the early 19
thcentury.
235
We also expect that in Asian countries, as well as in Australia and New Zealand, capital
expenditures in the coming years will also cover the replacement and refurbishment of existinggrid infrastructure (source: Global Transmission Research, “Global Utility Transmission InvestmentReport 2019-2028”).
11.2.3 Competitive Environment
We believe that major competitive factors in our Addressed Transmission Market include
portfolio coverage, price, product and solution reliability and availability, efficiency, quality,technology (including digitalization), experience, references, environmental impact, ability tomatch local requirements and standards, as well as service capabilities. Long-term relationshipswith customers result in supply frame contracts and long-term service agreements.
The competitor landscape in our Addressed Transmission Market is complex. With its products,
solutions and services, Siemens Energy’s Transmission division addresses customer segments alongthe energy value chain, including customers active in power generation, those active intransmission and distribution as well as industrial customers acting as consumers or prosumers.We compete with other large global players, mainly with the power grids division of ABB AseaBrown Boveri Ltd., Zurich (Switzerland) (“ ABB”), 80.1% of which was acquired by Hitachi Tokyo
(Japan) in July 2020 (with an option to acquire the remaining interest later) and which nowoperates under the name Hitachi ABB Power Grids Ltd. (“ Hitachi ABB Power Grids ”), and with
General Electric International, Inc., headquartered in Boston/Massachusetts (United States)(“GE”), including the acquired Alstom power and grid business. Other competitors are active in
one or more areas of our Addressed Transmission Market, including TBEA Co., Ltd., Changji(China), China XD Group, Xian (China) (“ China XD ”), Pinggao Co. Ltd., Henan (China), Toshiba
Corporation, Tokyo (Japan), Hyundai Group Co., Ltd., Seoul (South Korea), SGB-Smit GmbH,Regensburg (Germany), Hyosung Heavy Industries, Seoul (South Korea) and upcoming, expandingmulti-regional players like Larsen & Toubro Limited, Mumbai (India). There are also many smallcompanies which are typically specialized in particular market segments, and most of them arefocused on the regions in which they are based.
During the last few years, the market showed consolidation, internal reorganizations and
cooperations among players. For example, in addition to Hitachi’s acquisition of ABB’s powergrids division, as mentioned above, SNC-Lavalin and ABB announced the formation of the Linxonjoint venture in December 2017, focusing on the execution of turnkey electrical AC substationprojects. Moreover, in 2019, GE integrated its grid solutions business with its renewable energybusiness.
Certain portions of our Addressed Transmission Market, for example the business for large HVDC
or grid access projects within Transmission Solutions, are project-driven. In these businesses forlarge HVDC and grid access solutions, the top-three global players (which include SiemensEnergy), account for a sizeable share of the relevant market segment. By contrast, other types ofbusiness, such as that relating to air-insulated switchgear and gas-insulated switchgear, arecharacterized by a market environment including both international players and a fairly largenumber of local providers.
We estimate that we became the largest player in our Addressed Transmission Market worldwide
in 2019, closely followed by Hitachi ABB Power Grids, before GE and China XD. Siemens Energy’sand Hitachi ABB Power Grids’ market position in a given year is highly dependent on thesolutions and HVDC business, in particular with respect to varying volumes relating to largeprojects. We also assess that we were the largest or second largest player in each of our threemain regions (the Americas, EMEA and Asia, Australia) in 2019.
The global Transmission Products and Systems market segment of our Addressed Transmission
Market is fragmented, with a large number of small and medium-sized participants that mainlycater to specific market segments and to customers which are mostly focused on a low capitalinvestment. However, some organized global or regional participants account for a considerableportion of the Transmission Product market segment, since these types of electrical equipmentconstitute critical infrastructure for power networks, which typically require a high level of
236
reliability and offer customers a lower overall total cost of ownership ( i.e., a combination of
capital expenditures and operating expenses investment). According to our own assessment, wewere the second largest player in the global Transmission Products and Systems market segmentof our Addressed Transmission Market in 2019, behind Hitachi ABB Power Grids and before GEand China XD. In our assessment, we have narrowed the gap to the market leader Hitachi ABBPower Grids in this market segment, gaining 1 percentage point in market share from 2018 to2019. Also based on our own assessment, within the Transmission Products and Systems marketsegment we believe we were the global market leader for switching products ( i.e., air-insulated
switchgear and gas-insulated switchgear, circuit breakers, disconnecting switches, etc.) and thesecond largest global player for non-switching products ( i.e., power transformers and distribution
transformers, bushings, instrument transformers, coil products, etc.) in 2019.
Within the Transmission Solutions market segment of our Addressed Transmission Market,
businesses such as the grid access and HVDC market segments, as mentioned above, are highlyproject-driven. Due to the decreasing HVDC investment in China, the State Grid Corporation ofChina (SGCC) is selectively participating in oversea projects. In the grid access area, competitioncontinues to increase by market entries of new participants ( e.g., shipyards, mainly acting in the
AC grid access business). Moreover, in the substation and FACTS business areas, the three mainplayers – Siemens Energy, Hitachi ABB Power Grids and GE – play an important role. However, aconsiderable portion of substation projects tends to be awarded to individual national playerswhich execute, on average, less than one project per year. In the market segment forTransmission Solutions, we estimate that we were the largest player worldwide in 2019, followedby Hitachi ABB Power Grids, GE and the SGCC.
In the Transmission Services market segment, which is mainly a small project business for
switching products, there are several smaller local independent service providers with (in manycases) aggressive pricing strategies, multi-brand service offerings, lean set-ups and low-coststructures. We assess that we were the second largest player in the Transmission Services marketsegment worldwide in 2019, after Hitachi ABB Power Grids and before GE.
In our assessment, the following factors contribute to our strong market position: (i) our
environmentally-friendly and carbon neutral portfolio elements, (ii) our digitally enabledportfolio, (iii) our leading HVDC technologies, (iv) our comprehensive safety concepts (to prevent,protect and mitigate grid operational issues), (v) our wide-range of grid stabilizing portfolioelements and solutions (we estimate that we have a leading position in the field of grid stabilityproducts, in terms of order intake for 2019, in euro, for FACTS and phase shifters), and (vi) thefact that our portfolio can act as enabler for offshore wind grid access.
11.3 The Addressed Generation Market
11.3.1 Introduction; Definitions and Methodology
Our Generation division offers central and distributed generation products ( e.g., gas turbines,
steam turbines, generators and engines), solutions ( e.g., large and industrial power plants as well
as I&C and electrical solutions) and services ( e.g., spare parts, field services, long-term programs,
O&M and controls, digitalization and electrical modernizations and upgrades) addressing a widefield of market segments in the power generation industry. For more information on ourGeneration offering, see “ 12.3.2 Generation Division ”.
Our Addressed Generation Market (as defined and assessed by us; see “ 11.3.1.2 Market
Definitions and Methodology ”) is based on fossil fuels such as gas, oil and coal. These fuels
(together with nuclear and hydro power) have been providing the backbone of electricitygeneration globally for many years. Proliferation of renewables such as wind and solar PV haveled to widely differing trends in different countries and regions depending on the existinginfrastructure, availability of fuel, wealth and environmental policies. While some countries (suchas China, India or Indonesia) continue to invest in coal, others have been looking for alternativefuels. We expect this shift away from coal to continue. An increasing number of powergeneration companies are switching from coal to gas (so-called “coal to gas shift”), supported bylow gas prices and increasing carbon prices, or due to regulations. We also believe that in many
237
countries and regions gas will be a transitional source of fuel providing a market for highly
efficient large gas (and steam) turbines and for small and medium-sized gas turbines fordecentralized power generation. With more availability of carbon-neutrally produced hydrogen,we see hydrogen substitute gas as a fuel providing a market for hydrogen-enabled gas turbinescontributing to decarbonization. For example, in July 2020, the European Union adopted a EUhydrogen strategy to explore how clean hydrogen can help reduce the EU economy’s carbonemissions and make the EU climate-neutral by 2050, and in June 2020, Germany adopted anational hydrogen strategy. Furthermore, we see control and digitalization solutions and servicesas key enablers for operational improvement, allowing power generation plants to increasesafety and uptime. In particular, digitalization is expected to be a growth field, for example withpredictive maintenance to reduce costs in the operation of assets.
11.3.1.1 The Power Generation Industry
Energy in the form of electricity, heating and cooling is essential for societies and economies, as
these forms of energy are required for living and working space, operation of appliances incommercial and manufacturing sectors, as well as for the operation of buildings and mobility.
The power generation industry supplies these forms of energy for final use by converting various
sources of energy, namely:
 Conventional fuels, including fossil ( e.g., natural gas, coal and oil) and nuclear fuels
 Renewable resources ( e.g., solar, wind, hydro, biomass, geothermal resources)
Power generation may be dedicated to one single form of energy ( e.g., electricity) or performed
in a combined form ( e.g., co-generation of electricity and heat). Power generation can also be
categorized as either dispatchable power generation (which can be switched on and off) orintermittent power generation from renewable sources based on the availability of theseresources (such as wind or solar irradiation). Different types of storage, ranging from batteriesfor sub-hourly differences to “power-to-x” for longer-term balancing, are used to balance gapsbetween supply and demand.
High power densities are provided from central generation ( e.g., large fossil power plants or
offshore wind power plants), while distributed generation ( e.g., onshore wind or decentral
power plants) enable the supply of energy at much lower densities and are, for example,embedded at dedicated consumer sites or in remote areas.
The United Nations’ SDG 7 aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern
energy for all”. Therefore, a sound mix of different kinds of power generation technologies isrequired, which needs to consider emissions, existing grid infrastructure, generation costs,security of supply, subsidies, fuel availability, regulatory framework and other regional criteria.
The power generation industry is facing a deep transformation, which requires solutions for
decarbonization. Electricity generation is expected to grow significantly in the next years (see“11.1.3.2.1 Demand Growth for Energy and Electricity ”). In addition, the power generation
industry has started an energy transition moving from conventional power generation torenewable sources, with a significant decrease of relevance for coal. For more information, see“11.1.3.2 Energy Trends and Transformation of Energy Markets ”).
11.3.1.2 Market Definitions and Methodology
We define our “ Addressed Generation Market ” based on the business mandate of our
Generation division. The business mandate is defined by the market potential we assess for ourGeneration business (see “ 12.3.2 Generation Division ”). Conversely, segments and categories that
are currently not part of our business have been left aside for purposes of defining ourAddressed Generation Market. By business type , our Addressed Generation Market comprises:

includes mostly the service activities relating to the fleet of installed Siemens Energy productsin service (whether effectively serviced by the Group or not), in terms of market potential, i.e.,
of the potential revenues from different service activities that may be performed after the saleof new equipment; and (ii) to a lesser extent, our own service activities provided for third-partyOEM machines.
It must be noted that the services relating to distributed generation ( e.g., spare parts, field
service, long-term programs, O&M and controls, digital and electrical solutions and upgradesrelating to distributed generation assets) are not part of our Addressed Generation Market, butare rather part of our Addressed Industrial Applications Market, as explained under“11.4.1.2 Market Definitions and Methodology ”.
In addition, we apply a principle of market value consolidation to eliminate double counting, as
we also do for our Addressed Transmission Market. For more information, see “ 11.2.1.2 Market
Definitions and Methodology ”.
Moreover, we also analyze our Addressed Generation Market from a geographic perspective ,b y
region (Americas, EMEA and Asia, Australia).
Furthermore, from a different perspective, based on the main types of generation , our
Addressed Generation Market can be split into the following two market segments (whichinclude a products and solutions scope and, for central generation, a services scope as well):
Central generation , which includes:
Products and Solutions :
 Large gas equipment and solutions for SCPPs and CCPPS with a gas turbine unit size of at least
100 MW (the scope includes up to full turnkey solutions including gas and steam turbinepackages (for CCPPs), generators, I&C and electrical as well as heat transfer technology)
 Large steam equipment for large steam turbine power plants with steam turbines of at least
250 MW (the scope includes steam turbine packages only)
 I&C and electrical systems for conventional (fossil and nuclear) and hybrid power plants Decarbonization solutions to guide customers through a decarbonization pathway, e.g.,
coal-to-biomass conversion, hybridization and energy storage
Services :
 Spare parts, field service, long-term programs, O&M and controls, modernizations, digital and
electrical solutions and upgrades relating to central generation assets
239
Distributed generation , which includes the following products and solutions:
 Industrial gas equipment and solutions for SCPPs and CCPPs with a gas turbine unit size smaller
than 100 MW (the scope includes full turnkey solutions including gas and steam (for CCPPs)turbine packages, generators, I&C and electrical systems as well as heat transfer technology)
 Industrial steam equipment for industrial steam turbine power plants with steam turbines
smaller than 250 MW (the scope includes steam turbine package only). Besides conventionalfossil plants, this category also comprises applications for biomass-waste and concentratedsolar power plants.
 Engines, including gas engines with 250 kW to 3 MW for standby and continuous applicationsWe assess the market size of our Addressed Generation Market taking, in general, three
dimensions for measurement into consideration: the power capacity additions (in MW), thenumber of units ( e.g., the number of gas or steam turbines ordered in a given year) and in terms
of full turnkey scope value (based on order intake), expressed in euro. The value depends on therespective scope of supply. It is assessed with the specific price of power plants’ capitalexpenditure per kW for either product or turnkey scope.
In order to assess the size of our Addressed Generation Market for new units (products and
solutions) for a given year, the time of a project award and order intake is considered. Inaddition, certain historical market data for the gas and steam turbine market sub-segments aremainly based on the reports published by McCoy Power Reports, Richmond/Virginia (UnitedStates) (“ McCoy ”). Further internal assessments complement the data for market categories or
dimensions regarding which no or insufficient external reports are available. For the short-termprospects, including projected growth (two to three years), we derive the market outlook for ourAddressed Generation Market from our bottom-up sales force intelligence, which tracks allknown projects in the market, while the long-term outlook uses a top-down model approach,based to a large extent on external data from IHS Markit on gross capacity additions andassumptions on construction time. For example, to assess the market size for the fiscal year 2023,the value is backward-calculated considering the gross capacity additions expected for the fiscalyear 2025, under assumption of a technology-specific construction time of two years. We also useother major external market data and insights ( e.g., from the IEA) to analyze different market
scenarios and to validate our own assumptions.
The assessment and analysis of the service portion of our Addressed Generation Market follows a
different approach compared to new units, and follows the rationale that customers purchase, toa large extent, services from the OEMs that provided the equipment, and to a lesser extent fromthird parties, as explained above. In both cases, the market segment relating to service is basedon revenue streams (or, with respect to future periods, expected revenue streams), which dependon the utilization of our existing own fleet and our own service business with additional newunits, taking into account also market price changes. The allocation of the revenue streamswithin the service portion of our Addressed Generation Market to a certain year follows, ingeneral, the expected timing of major outages as well as for backlog of long-term serviceprograms (“ LTPs” ), among other factors. In general, the allocation of service market revenues is
based on an approximation of the fiscal year or years in which the revenue potential would bepaid.
For purposes of the calculation of our market position within the Addressed Generation Market,
the service portion of such market, which as explained above is largely based on the serviceactivities performed on our own installed product fleet, has not been considered. Instead, themarket position assessments relating to our Addressed Generation Market are based only on theportion of such market relating to new units.
Foreign currency amounts for the fiscal year 2019 (and any other historic periods) are converted
into€using exchange rates for the respective fiscal year. Projection figures relating to the
current fiscal year and any future fiscal years ( e.g., for the fiscal year 2025, as shown in the table
further below) are calculated taking into consideration (i) a projected foreign exchange rate (inthe case of the figures shown in this chapter, the foreign exchange rates for March 3, 2020 have
240
been used as projected rates for the respective foreign currencies over the complete forecast
period) and (ii) projected general capital cost effects.
The data for both the new unit and service market segments of our Addressed Generation
Market is regularly updated in a periodic process with several stakeholders to identify marketchanges. We also use our regularly updated market analysis to adapt the strategy of ourGeneration division accordingly.
11.3.2 Market Size, Development and Trends
We estimate that our total Addressed Generation Market amounted to approximately
€28.3 billion in 2019. Thereof, approximately €21.8 billion related to central generation and
approximately €6.5 billion to distributed generation.
All figures shown in this section have been assessed prior to a consideration of the potential
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, we expect volatility, in particularin the market segment relating to gas turbines, in service utilization, customers’ financial positionand project timing (including potential shifts of orders for projects delayed due to the effects ofthe pandemic to subsequent fiscal years). In general terms, we assume a peak near-term negativeimpact on our Addressed Generation Market of up to a low double-digit percentage. In thelonger-term, in particular with respect to the 2025 figures shown below, we currently expect theCOVID-19 pandemic would have a significantly less profound impact on market developments.We expect some volatility in drivers such as the financial strength of customers and theirwillingness to invest as well as regarding project timing (including potential shifts of orders forprojects delayed due to the effects of the pandemic to subsequent fiscal years). Given theseuncertainties that remain at this time, for example as regards the timing and magnitude of thepotential impact, actual market developments may turn out to be different from thosementioned in this section.
Even though we are experiencing project delays on the new unit business and shifts of service
outages (but in both areas with only minor cancellations), we currently expect that some of theseeffects are recoverable. In particular for the high share of Service business with long-term serviceagreements, we continue to see reasonable utilization levels globally, though with regionaldifferences due to COVID-19’s impact on energy demand over the next years. However, low gasprices and a stronger shift towards renewables may support the construction of new gas powerplants and accelerate the retirement of coal power plants.
Overall, we expect that the total Addressed Generation Market will remain largely flat over the
2019-2025 period (with approximately €27.4 billion in 2025), mainly reflecting the trend towards
decarbonization (see “ 11.1.3.2.2 Decarbonization ”). This development is characterized by an
expected increase in electricity generation: According to the IEA’s Sustainable DevelopmentScenario, electricity generation could increase by 11% over a similar period (2018-2025), mainlydriven by natural gas and renewables (with an increase of 17% and 63%, respectively), while coaland oil generation are expected to decrease (by 23% and 34%, respectively) during the sameperiod (source: WEO 2019, Sustainable Development Scenario; absolute increases in TWh for the2018-2025 period). Natural gas-fired generation has tripled over the past 22 years (source: WEO2019). This also underlines the role of this business in the energy transition. Gas is expected toremain a key technology in the future, as its dispatchability provides for the required reliabilityand flexibility of energy systems. At the same time, gas can play an important role as enabler forthe decarbonization of energy systems, as supported by several industry reports, including IEA’sWEO 2019 and BNEF’s “New Energy Outlook 2019” (see “ 11.1.1 Overview ”). Applications such as
“coal-to-gas”, decentral hybrid solutions and the burning of green fuels ( e.g., hydrogen-rich
gases) help customers to significantly reduce their carbon footprint.
However, as shown in the table below, we expect the future development during the period
until 2025 to vary among the different market segments and categories. We also see a generaltrend towards distributed generation and renewables. As a result, we deem the centralgeneration market segment of our Addressed Generation Market to generally shrink (with anexpected decrease of 1.4% (in terms of CAGR) over the 2019-2025 period, in particular due to a
241
reduction in the business relating to large steam equipment), while the distributed generation
market segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 2.0% during the 2019-2025period.
The following table provides an overview of the market size of our Addressed Generation Market
and the expected market development, both for the overall market as well as for individualmarket segments and categories (all figures in €billion, except percentages; years shown refer to
Siemens Energy’s fiscal years):

used to eliminate double counting, e.g., for products that are later integrated into a solution; see “ 11.3.1.2 Market
Definitions and Methodology ”.
* “Services” refers mainly to the service activities relating to the fleet of installed Siemens Energy equipment in operation
(whether effectively serviced by the Group or not) and, to a lesser extent, our own service activities provided for third-party OEM equipment; see “ 11.3.1.2 Market Definitions and Methodology ”.
In the medium-term ( i.e., until 2025), we see the following market developments and trends for
the main market segments and categories of our Addressed Generation Market:
Within the central generation market segment, we see investment activity for large gas
equipment and solutions in countries with high energy demand, for example in the Middle East,Africa and Asia, and coming from a replacement of large coal and nuclear units, for example inNorth America, Europe and Asia (as part of the shift from coal to gas). Therefore, there is stilldemand for baseload applications with strong requirement on high efficiency to save fuel and tolower emissions during operations. Due to the growing integration of renewables, flexibility isexpected to become more important, for example regarding ramp-up times as well as usinggreen fuels, such as hydrogen. In addition, large steam equipment remains under pressure, dueto several countries stopping coal activities and as a result of more stringent and widespread CO
2
targets, which in turn are limiting financing available to coal projects. Also, the utilization ofexisting coal-fired generation is expected to decrease due to earlier retirement of sites. Overall,we have observed a significant decline for large gas turbines within the central generationmarket segment during the past few years mainly due to the fast shift to renewables. In thecoming years, we expect global demand for large gas turbines at a level of around 70 to 80 unitsper year (own assessment based on an internal analysis) (compared to approximately 200 largegas turbines ordered in 2014, a sharp decline of approximately 60% until 2018 and a stabilizationin 2019 on approximately 80 units as assessed by us derived from McCoy data). For the 2019-2025period, we expect a slight decline (at a CAGR of approximately -1%) in the large gas turbines
242
market segment, in euro, and a clear decline (at a CAGR of approximately -9% over the 2019-
2025 period) for the market segment relating to large steam turbines for coal applications, ineuro. We also expect growth in the product segment relating to powerful jumbo frames of over300 MW, driven by the shift from coal to gas, energy auctions for base load and gas-to-power(i.e., projects with a power plant and integrated gas import, such as LNG). With respect to I&C
and electrical systems for conventional power plants, the market in general is expected to closelyfollow the development of the gas, coal and nuclear markets. We expect central generationservices to remain stable, supported by large fleets, which demand for modernizations of existingcustomer assets to meet future decarbonization targets and digital solutions for furtherperformance optimization. Furthermore, we see control and digitalization solutions and servicesas key enablers for operational improvement, allowing power generation plants to increasesafety and uptime. In particular, digitalization is expected to be a growth field, for example withpredictive maintenance to reduce costs in the operation of assets.
Within the distributed generation market segment, we see a trend to decentralization positively
impacting the business relating to industrial gas equipment and solutions, with industrialdemand mostly coming from industrialized countries in Europe and America as well as emergingeconomies in Asia leading to a stable market outlook over the 2019-2025 period. In particular, weexpect increasing demand from industrial and municipality customers for CHP applications (see“12.3.2.2.2 Power Plant Solutions ”) and hybrid solutions with storage (see
“12.3.2.2.4 Decarbonized Solutions ”). With respect to industrial steam equipment, the market is
moderately growing, as industrial steam is also addressing “green” areas such as biomass waste,geothermal and concentrated solar power. Also process heat is still required in many industrialapplications, which is also supporting demand for industrial steam. As regards engines, we expectgrowth in the gas engines business, driven by the increase in demand for continuous and standbypower generation, stringent environmental norms and low natural gas prices.
11.3.3 Competitive Environment
We believe that major competitive factors in our Addressed Generation Market and its market
segments include portfolio coverage, price, life cycle economics, product reliability andavailability, efficiency, emissions footprint, references, the ability to match local requirementsand standards, as well as service, financing and project development capabilities. Long-termrelationships with customers result in framework and long-term service agreements.
The competitive environment in our Addressed Generation Market is heterogeneous and
characterized by evolving roles.
 While large gas turbines products are for the most part provided by key OEMs, including
Siemens Energy, GE, Mitsubishi Power, Ltd., Yokohama (Japan) (“ MHPS ”) and Ansaldo Energia,
Genova (Italy) (“ Ansaldo ”), the solution scope is covered by a large number of national and
multinational EPC companies, e.g., Bechtel Corporation, Reston/Virginia (United States),
Marubeni Corporation, Tokyo (Japan), Iberdrola S.A., Bilbao (Spain), Doosan Heavy Industries &Construction Co., Ltd., Changwon (South Korea), or Sepco3, Qindao (China). In solutionprojects, therefore, depending on local conditions, capacities and risk profile, among otherfactors, either OEMs take the lead (in cases in which they also provide a full-turnkey solution)or they work with partners and subcontractors in consortia.
 For large steam products, the market is mostly served by Chinese players (such as Harbin
Turbine Co. Ltd., Harbin (China), Dongfang Turbine Co., Ltd., Deyang City (China), andShanghai Electric Group, Shanghai (China), and Indian players (such as Bharat Heavy ElectricalsLimited, New Delhi (India)).
 For I&C and electrical systems the competitive environment differs, with ABB, Emerson Electric
Company, Ferguson/Missouri (United States), and Yokogawa Denki K.K., Tokyo (Japan), beingamong our typical competitors in the OEM and EPC business.
 In the area of industrial gas equipment and solutions, our main competitors are GE, Solar
Turbines, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., Kobe (Japan) and MHPS.
243
 In the area of industrial steam equipment, we find also different competitors, for example
Triveni Turbine Ltd., Bangalore (India), Toshiba, Hangzhou Steam Turbines Co. Ltd., Hangzhou(China), and WEG Industries S.A., Jaraguá do Sul (Brazil) (which acquired a controlling stake inthe Brazilian TGM (Industria e Comércio de Turbinas e Tranmissões Ltda)).
 In the engine business, the main market players are Innio Jenbacher GmbH & Co OG, Jenbach
(Austria), MAN Energy Solutions SE (formerly MAN Diesel & Turbo), Augsburg (Germany), andWärtsilä Corporation, Helsinki (Finland) (“ Wärtsilä ”).
There is also a certain competition between the different types of application, for example
between gas turbines and engines. Therefore, we believe that a broad portfolio enablescompanies active in our Addressed Generation Market to supply best-fitting solutions tocustomers. In addition, although we define the service portion of our Addressed GenerationMarket to include mostly our Siemens Energy fleet, we face competition from other OEMs andfrom third-party suppliers, for example based on former technology license agreements ( e.g.,
Ansaldo and its subsidiary Power Systems Mfg., LLC, Jupiter/Florida (United States), as well asMHPS).
We assess that we are well-positioned within our Addressed Generation Market in key businesses.
In our assessment, we were in most cases either the largest or among the two largest players inour main focus market categories in 2019: In the distributed generation market segment, weestimate that we were the largest player in the field of industrial gas equipment and solutions in2019, in terms of industrial gas turbine units ordered (with an estimated market share close to30% in 2019 for industrial gas turbines, in terms of units ordered; we also estimate that we havegained market share (approximately 4 percentage points) between the fiscal year 2018 and thefiscal year 2019). This is mainly due to our leading role in CHP (within distributed generation)with our SGT-800 turbine, which in our own assessment offers higher efficiency in the 62 MWvariant than comparable competitor products, and our expansion in the field of hybrid solutionsfor decarbonized energy systems. We also assess that we were the largest player in the field ofindustrial steam equipment in 2019, in terms of order intake for industrial steam turbines,measured in euro (with an estimated market share of approximately 30% for industrial steamturbines in 2019, in euro; we estimate that we have been able to maintain the distance to ourcompetitors so far in the current fiscal year), due to our efficient products and comprehensiveportfolio and our leading position regarding applications for the growing biomass and pulp &paper markets (based on our own assessment) and a significant share of high-volume projects. Inaddition, we estimate that we were the second largest player in the field of large gas equipmentand solutions within the central generation market segment of our Addressed GenerationMarket in 2019, in terms of large gas turbine units ordered, driven by the market launch of ourhigh-efficiency HL gas turbine class and our comprehensive portfolio, which allows us to act as a“one-stop” solution provider. Furthermore, we estimate that we were the leading provider ofF-Class large gas turbines (a technology that has been used for gas turbines for several decades)and the second largest provider of H/J-Class large gas turbines (advanced high-efficiency gasturbine technology) in 2019, in terms of the number of units ordered for the respective category.Given that global demand for large gas turbines is typically for a relatively limited number ofunits per year, multi-unit orders may have a significant impact on market shares for large gasturbines in a given year, potentially resulting in changes in the market position among the majorplayers from one year to another.
We also assess that we had the second largest fleet worldwide as of the end of the fiscal year
2019, representing an estimated 25% of the total global fleet of approximately 14,000 installedlarge gas turbines and large steam turbines (own assessment, based on several industry sources,including fleet data and other market sources; our estimated share of the global fleet istechnology-based, i.e., it includes turbines using our technology, whether branded by us or by a
third party). In addition, we estimate that as of the end of the fiscal year 2019 our fleet of largegas turbines and large steam turbines represented approximately 30% of the total fleet of suchturbines in the Americas; within EMEA, approximately 20% of the total fleet for such turbines inEurope and approximately 30% in the Middle East and Africa (taken together); and within Asia,Australia, we had a share of approximately 15% of the installed base in China and approximately
244
25% of the installed base in the rest of the region (in each case, according to our own
assessment, based on several industry sources, including fleet data and other market sources; forthis calculation, Siemens Energy fleet shares include both those turbines marketed with our ownbrand and licensed units that use our technology but are marketed under a third-party brand).
Overall, we estimate that we were the second largest player in our Addressed Generation Market
in 2019 worldwide, after GE and before MHPS and Ansaldo, in terms of the number of new unitsand value, in euro.
11.4 The Addressed Industrial Applications Market
11.4.1 Introduction; Definitions and Methodology
Our Industrial Applications division addresses a wide variety of market segments along almost
the entire value chain of the oil & gas industry and many process industries such as chemicals,synthetic fuels, air separation, fiber, marine, metals & mining. For these industries we offer abroad portfolio of products, integrated systems and solutions, comprising rotating equipment(mainly turbo compressors, reciprocating compressors and certain gas turbines), integrated drive-train systems, electrification, automation and digital solutions for the on- and offshore industry,the marine industry and the fiber industry, and water treatment solutions. We also provideservices for oil & gas and distributed generation customers, including other industries such asfood and beverages, minerals and metals, industrial parks and municipalities, among others. Formore information on our product, solutions and service offering, see “ 12.3.3 Industrial
Applications Division ”.
The common denominator of our Addressed Industrial Applications Market (as defined and
assessed by us; see “ 11.3.1.2 Market Definitions and Methodology ”) is the movement of large
volume of liquids and gases. A large part of the market comprises the upstream, midstream anddownstream portions of the oil & gas value chain. However, process industries (including thepower industry), which require fuel, oil-based raw materials or catalysts, constitute verysignificant end-markets, accounting for roughly one-third of our total Addressed IndustrialApplications Market in 2019. While oil and gas will continue to contribute a significant share ofglobal primary energy demand in the coming decades (as indicated in the IEA’s WEO 2019, forexample), we expect that carbon-based fuels will increasingly be substituted by hydrogen.Primary energy consumption is expected to shift to a higher share of natural gas facilitated by itslower environmental footprint and feedstock availability, partially at the expense of coal and oil.We also expect an increasing electrification of processes in order to comply with increasing needsto decarbonize oil & gas operations. In addition, we see digitalization as a key enabler foroperational improvement, increasing safety ( e.g., with new de-manning and virtual solutions),
uptime, throughput, and higher productivity ( e.g., with remote monitoring and services).
11.4.1.1 The Value Chain of the Oil & Gas Industry Relevant to our Industrial Applications Division
The oil & gas value chain can be split into (i) the upstream segment, with exploration and
production (“ E&P”),i.e., onshore and offshore drilling, unconventional production (pumping and
compression), conventional onshore and offshore production and processing; (ii) the midstreamsegment, with LNG, gas and liquid pipelines and storage solutions; and (iii) the downstreamsegment, with refining, marketing and retail and petrochemicals. In addition, new business fieldsare emerging from oil & gas customers, such as power co-generation, energy storage, carboncapture, utilization and storage, hydrogen economy (production, compression, liquefication andtransportation of hydrogen) and “power-to-x”. Siemens Energy is mainly active as an OEM inmany different sections of the value chain, as explained in more detail in “ 11.4.1.2 Market
Definitions and Methodology ”.
The upstream activities of the oil & gas value chain include the exploration, development and
production of oil and gas from resources and reserves. Most countries grant oil & gasdevelopment rights to private and/or state-owned companies such as international oil companies(“IOC”) and national oil companies (“ NOC ”), respectively, as well as to independent E&P
companies through a process of negotiation or bidding. Most agreements between oil & gas
245
companies and governments are structured as “production sharing agreements”. Once the rights
to explore are acquired, a well is drilled. If the well can produce enough oil and gas to cover thecost of completion and production, it will be put in production. Due to their complexity, mostupstream projects are carried out under some type of partnership structure, for exampleinvolving several IOCs, NOCs, oilfield service providers and EPC companies.
The midstream segment of the oil & gas value chain involves the transportation, storage and
distribution of oil and gas. Crude oil that is produced must be transported from the well head toa refinery. Transportation is carried out through shipping (tankers), railroad, truck, and pipelines.Natural gas must also be transported from production sites to downstream markets anddistributors via pipelines (land or under the sea) or ships in form of LNG. The midstream segmentinvolves many players, including IOCs, NOCs, independent companies, shipping companies andEPCs.
Oil and gas storage plays an important role in providing flexibility and security of oil and gas
supplies. Large storage tanks hold large amounts of oil, natural gas, LNG and otherpetrochemicals. Furthermore, storage can be connected directly to large consumers with highlyvolatile gas demand such as gas-fired power plants.
Thedownstream segment of the oil & gas value chain includes refining and petrochemicals, oil &
gas marketing and retail (retail refers to the sale of gas to consumers). The refining of crude oilproduces a variety of products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and chemical feedstocks.Products are sold directly to end-users through retail locations, directly to large users (such asutilities and commercial customers), and through wholesale networks. In the downstreamsegment, IOCs play a major role. Increasingly, NOCs are stepping into the merchant refiningbusiness as a means of capturing additional value added from their crude production.Petrochemicals (also known as petroleum distillates) are the chemical products obtained frompetroleum by refining. Some chemical compounds made from petroleum are also obtained fromother fossil fuels, such as natural gas. The two most common petrochemical classes are olefins(including ethylene and propylene) and aromatics (including benzene, toluene and xyleneisomers). Oil refineries produce olefins and aromatics by fluid catalytic cracking of petroleumfractions. Chemical plants produce olefins by steam cracking of natural gas liquids like ethaneand propane. Aromatics are produced by catalytic reforming of naphtha. Olefins and aromaticsare the building-blocks for a wide range of materials such as solvents, detergents, and adhesives.Olefins are the basis for polymers and oligomers used in plastics, resins, fibers, elastomers,lubricants, and gels. Many refineries and chemical plants are co-located, providing opportunitiesfor support services and synergies.
11.4.1.2 Market Definitions and Methodology
We assess our “ Addressed Industrial Applications Market ” based on the business mandate of our
Industrial Applications division. The business mandate is defined by the market potential weassess for our Industrial Applications business, including our business relating to different parts ofthe oil & gas value chain as well as the business relating to other industrial applications (see“12.3.3 Industrial Applications Division ”).

Our market evaluation of our Addressed Industrial Applications Market is based on our internal
evaluation of available external reports provided by industry analysts ( e.g., Rystad, IHS Markit,
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“ OPEC ”), the U.S. Energy Information
Administration (“ EIA”), the IEA, the Energy Industries Council (“ EIC”), the non-commercial
foundation Norwegian Energy Partners (“ Norwep ”), Clarksons Research (Clarkson PLC, London
(United Kingdom)), McCoy Gas Turbine Analytics (from McCoy) and the International CompressorApplications and Machinery Committee (“ ICAAMC ”), among others), which contain information
on expenditure development, projects, as well as an analysis of internal data available withinSiemens Energy as part of customer relationship management tools and expert knowledge.
Our market assessment for products and solutions is based both on a bottom-up approach and a
top-down approach. The bottom-up approach is based on a database of projects which areexpected to be awarded in the market within the considered time frame, which we compileusing both external and internal sources. As part of our market evaluation process, we estimatean addressable share for our Industrial Applications division in these projects (regardless ofwhether the project is expected to be effectively awarded to Siemens Energy or to a competitor).Market sizes for new equipment are based on expected order intake potential for the scoperelevant to our addressable share within the respective projects.
248
Besides the bottom-up perspective, we use a top-down approach based on evaluation of
expected capital expenditures volumes using external sources such as those mentioned above inthis section. The market estimates are also verified with product line and regional experts of theGroup to achieve an aligned, thorough view. For our projections relating to our AddressedIndustrial Applications Market, we also use projections relating to GDP development, oil and gasdemand, oil prices and capacity utilization, in addition to projected capital and operatingexpenditures. In general terms, market segments react to oil price fluctuations in a different way:While segments with traditionally higher break-even costs such as unconventional oil & gas andoffshore production are more sensitive to oil price drops, other market segments, especiallydownstream and other process industries show less volatility to oil price drops and might evenbenefit from a lower oil price due to the lower cost of the feedstock. The service business istypically not impacted by temporary oil price fluctuations, or only to a very limited extent.
For market evaluations on a market segment level, we consider, in addition, specific market
drivers and indicators such as number of floaters, jack ups, floating production storage andoffloading units (“ FPSO ”), platforms, capacity additions in LNG and downstream applications,
number of frac fleets in unconventional production, the amount of so-called “Christmas trees”(i.e., an assembly of valves, spools, and fittings used to regulate the flow of pipes in a well),
manifolds, control modules and new umbilical installations for the subsea market segment.
One of the key buying criteria on the part of customers is reliability. Therefore, they appreciate
and trust the knowledge, reputation and experience of OEM service providers, who are generallyin a better position to service their own branded equipment. Siemens Energy is positioned as afull-service provider for its own products and solutions, providing a holistic service offering. Asignificant portion of our business is transactional and includes spare parts, field service, andrepair and overhauls. However, Siemens Energy also offers advanced business services such aslong-term service programs (LTPs), O&M contracts, modernizations and upgrades, digital services,and training and consulting. The fact that customers usually purchase services from the OEMsthat provided the equipment is also reflected in the definition and calculation of the service
portion of our Addressed Industrial Applications Market and makes it different from the marketdefinition and assessment of the new equipment business (as described above). The assessmentand analysis of the service portion of our Addressed Industrial Applications Market is based on(i) the service activities relating to the fleet of installed Siemens Energy products in service
(whether effectively serviced by the Group or not), in terms of market potential, i.e., of the
potential revenues from different service activities that may be performed after the sale of newequipment; and (ii) to a lesser extent, our own service activities provided for third-party OEM
machines , in terms of actual revenues or, for future periods, an assessment of potential future
revenues based on past experience, among other factors. In the fiscal year 2019, we had asignificant market share (in terms of the value of the service activities performed on our service-relevant installed Industrial Applications fleet of roughly 79,000 units), e.g., the share for gas
turbines was approximately 70%. For more information on our Industrial Applications servicebusiness, see “ 12.3.3.4 Services ”. The main data sources for the assessment of the service portion
of the Addressed Industrial Applications Market are the installed base taken from our customerrelationship tool and the feedback from product line experts and regional experts about theestimated customer spends per equipment. External market data is used for verification of resultsand longer time horizons. We allocate the potential sales revenues of a given service contract todifferent years over the contractual term using a model that assumes a certain age-related salesprofile. This model is used both for transactional business and for LTP and similar contracts.
For purposes of the calculation of our market position within the Addressed Industrial
Applications Market, the service portion of such market, which as explained above is largelybased on the service activities performed on our own installed product fleet, has not beenconsidered. Instead, the market position assessments relating to our Addressed IndustrialApplications Market are based only on the products and solutions portion of such market.
All market figures are provided in euro. Foreign currency amounts for the fiscal year 2019 (and
any other historic periods) are converted into €using exchange rates for the respective fiscal
year. Projection figures relating to the current fiscal year and any future fiscal years ( e.g., for the
249
fiscal year 2025, as shown in the table further below) are calculated taking into consideration
(i) a projected foreign exchange rate (in the case of the figures shown in this chapter, the foreignexchange rates for March 3, 2020 have been used as projected rates for the respective foreigncurrencies over the complete forecast period) and (ii) projected general capital cost effects.
The following information on market environment, market developments, market volumes, and
the competitive environment represents our aggregation of diverse external and internal dataand estimates.
11.4.2 Market Size, Development and Trends
We estimate that our Addressed Industrial Applications Market amounted to approximately
€25.3 billion in 2019. Thereof, approximately €7.8 billion related to products, solutions and
services for the upstream oil & gas business, approximately €5.6 billion to products, solutions
and services for the midstream oil & gas business, approximately €3.2 billion to products,
solutions and services for the downstream oil & gas business, and approximately €8.7 billon to
industrial categories such as applications for the chemical industry, fiber solutions, air separationunits, applications for synthetic fuels and marine applications as well as for distributed powergeneration.
All figures shown in this section relating to our Addressed Industrial Applications Market have
been assessed prior to a consideration of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and thesharp drop in oil prices in early 2020, which resulted from demand contraction combined withsimultaneous large oversupply volumes. We expect the pandemic and lower oil price level toresult in volatility for our Addressed Industrial Applications Market, in particular with respect tocustomer capital expenditures and project timing mainly in the market segments of ourAddressed Industrial Applications Market relating to oil & gas. This can result in potential shiftsof orders from projects delayed to subsequent fiscal years or potential cancellations of futurecustomer investments/projects. We expect that operational expenditures and service utilization,as well as capital expenditures in the market segments relating to process industries, may be lessaffected. The major resiliency factor of our Service business is due to the fact that such business isbased on an already installed fleet and predominantly reflects necessary operating expendituresof our customers to ensure the sustainability of their business operations. We currently assume alower double-digit percentage peak negative market impact compared with the original estimatefor our Addressed Industrial Applications Market for 2020-2023. In the longer-term, in particularwith respect to the 2025 figures, we currently expect that the COVID-19 pandemic would have asignificantly less profound impact on market developments. We also expect that oil prices willrecover to pre-COVID-19 levels in the mid-term, and will reach around USD 65-70 bbl by 2025(source: Rystad “ServiceDemandCube” database projections for Brent oil price, retrieved inAugust 2020). However, uncertainties remain at this time, for example as regards the timing andmagnitude of the potential impact, so that actual market developments may turn out to bedifferent from those mentioned in this section.
Due to a diversified business mix for Siemens Energy’s Industrial Applications division, in
particular a significantly higher share of Service business compared to Products and Solutions, astrong Service backlog, as well as a high share of business relating to other process industries, weexpect that the effect of the above-mentioned market drop on our order intake and revenue willbe smoothened to a significant degree. Some of the negative impact may be recoverable;however, the recovery effect may be offset by customers shifting service demand to later years,e.g., due to set maintenance intervals, lower utilization and cost efficiency.
In 2019, we saw a continuing recovery across our addressed markets following a stabilization of
oil price levels, after an oil price crisis strongly impacted market volumes mainly during the 2016-2017 period. In early 2020, oil prices dropped again sharply, mainly due to the strong demandcontraction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and simultaneous high oversupply volumes. Asdemand for oil dropped, tensions regarding further production cuts rose between OPEC+members ( i.e., the informal denomination for the group consisting of OPEC’s 14 members and 10
non-OPEC nations, including Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan, among others). The oil price conflict
250
within OPEC+ ended with an agreement reached on April 13, 2020 by OPEC+ members to cut oil
production by nearly 10 million barrels a day, the largest amount ever, in an attempt to stopcrashing oil prices. However, due to the expiration of the futures contracts, U.S. oil pricesdropped to below USD zero a few days later and have thereafter recovered, however still on arelatively low level compared to 2019. According to the IEA’s Oil Market Report, May 2020, sincethe record drop in April 2020, the outlook has improved somewhat and prices, while still farbelow where they were before the start of the COVID-19 crisis, have rebounded from their Aprillows, mainly due to the easing of lockdown measures and steep production declines in non-OPECcountries alongside the commitments made by the OPEC+ agreement (source: IEA’s summarystatements on the Oil Market Report, May 2020, available on the IEA’s website).
According to our estimates, our total Addressed Industrial Applications Market is expected to
grow at a CAGR of approximately 2.0% over the 2019-2025 period, to reach approximately€28.4 billion in 2025, reflecting global economic growth, oil and gas demand growth and
improving oil price dynamics (according to Rystad “ServiceDemandCube” database, retrieved inAugust 2020, the price for Brent oil is expected to increase from an average of USD 64/bbl in 2019to around USD 65-70/bbl by 2025). We expect the positive development of these majormacroeconomic indicators to translate into robust spending growth by oil & gas companies andother industrial players relevant for our market scope during the next years. However, as shownin the table below, the expected future development during the period until 2025 is expected tovary among the different market segments and categories.
Our market growth projections are broadly in line with the view of major industry analysts such
as Rystad, which estimates an upstream and midstream oil & gas capital expenditure growth interms of CAGR of 2% over the 2019-2025 period (source: Rystad “ServiceDemandCube” database,retrieved in August 2020; the database includes all upstream and selected midstream categories).

251
In the medium-term market perspective, we see the following market developments for each of
the main segments of our Addressed Industrial Applications Market:
In the upstream offshore market segments of the oil & gas portion of our Addressed Industrial
Applications Market, we see investment activity continuing to recover across several regions,mainly Latin and North America, EMEA and Asia, Australia, with increasing numbers of floatingproduction systems facilitated by break-even cost adjustments (such as lower operating costs orhigher efficiency) adopted by exploration and production companies in order to run profitableprojects in light of a low oil price environment. In the subsea business, we expect increasingusage of subsea tie-back to existing offshore infrastructures and subsea power grids to avoidusing up part of the limited space on the topside. Overall, we expect growth for the upstreamoffshore market segment of our Addressed Industrial Applications Market over the 2019-2025period.
According to our market observations, activities in upstream onshore market segments are
picking up globally, both in conventional and unconventional market segments. The growth inupstream onshore is strongly driven by gas related applications, such as gas production,processing, and unconventional gas compression, especially in such countries and regions asRussia, North America, the Middle East, China, Australia and Central Asia. Beyond that, in theunconventional market segment, we see an increasing customer demand for gas turbine-basedelectric fracturing solutions offering better asset economics and environmental footprintcompared to diesel engines. Overall, we expect growth for upstream onshore markets over the2019-2025 period.
In 2019, we saw the midstream market segment of the oil & gas portion of our Addressed
Industrial Applications Market strongly benefitting from a new wave of LNG projectcommitments to avoid a potential supply shortfall after the fiscal year 2020, showing a historicpeak in 2019 for LNG. The new wave of final investment decisions regarding LNG liquefactionprojects is expected to have a more global spread, with upcoming project commitments inMozambique, Qatar, Russia and the United States.
We do not expect the midstream market segment to have similarly high volumes by 2025. This
explains the expected CAGR of -4.6 when the 2019-2025 period is considered. The drop in LNGover the 2019-2025 period is expected to be partially offset by robust growth in the marketsegment relating to pipelines. The growth in the market segment relating to pipelines isleveraged by upstream growth as well as the long-term and strategic nature of many pipelineprojects. Major growth regions are China (China is expected to double its pipeline infrastructureto over 240,000 km by 2025; source: Wood Mackenzie, news release “China’s pipeline reform:expect higher gas prices in the short-term”, October 9, 2020), Russia and Central Asia, which willbenefit from Chinese gas pipeline expansion plans. Beyond that, we see strong marketopportunities in North America.
The downstream market segment of the oil & gas portion of our Addressed Industrial
Applications Market was characterized by strong project activity in previous years. We expectshort-term growth in the refining sub-segment, facilitated by investments to accommodateamendments to the International Marine Organization (“ IMO”)‘s bunker fuel regulation and
improving standards as well as in related water solutions. While by the end of the forecast period(2025), investment volumes in refining are likely to slow down (the expected 2019-2025 CAGR is0%), we expect continuous growth in the petrochemicals sub-segment, strongly linked toexpected GDP growth and increasing demand for petrochemical products, especially in emergingeconomies and North America. In the petrochemicals market segment, we expect growth inpolyolefins and olefins, for example in conventional cracker applications in China.
Inindustry-related market segments, including air separation, chemicals, metallurgy and utilities
(e.g., regarding fuel gas compression applications for gas turbines), fiber and marine, as well as
services for distributed generation assets, we expect growth at a CAGR of 4.2% over the 2019-2025 period. In air separation, we expect a sustained recovery of the business relating toindustrial gases, driven by global GDP growth and related industrial growth, especially inemerging economies. The main industrial driver for industrial gases is steel, since oxygen and
252
argon are needed for steel-making from crude iron. Other industries with oxygen demand are
the chemicals, petrochemicals and refining, glass and PV industries. In the air separation businessrelating to gasification there is a strong demand, mainly from China and the United States,where petrochemical projects need air separation in order to produce syngas ( e.g., for methanol).
We expect that the chemicals markets will grow in line with GDP growth over the 2019-2025period. We also expect that increasing usage of polyester fibers and films will drive future PTAcapacity additions. Overall, the market is strongly driven by increasing demand, mainly comingfrom China relating to multiple applications of the chemicals market. In addition, we expect themetallurgy markets to grow, leveraged by recovering iron and steel markets following a strongdecline during the 2014-2017 period. Furthermore, we see continued growth for the fiberindustry in the packaging and tissue markets over the 2019-2025 period. Moreover, we expectChinese pulp demand to drive capital expenditures of the fiber industry in Russia, the Nordiccountries and South America. Within the marine industry, we expect growth in the navy, ferryand cruise areas, partially offset by a slow container vessel market. Distributed generationservices in the Middle East and Asia, Australia regions are expected to show the strongest growthover the 2019-2025 period, mainly because of increasing energy demand and a shift towards gas.In Europe, we expect growth to be leveraged by strong demand for decentral energy, supportedby governmental incentives, resulting in increasing modernization and upgrade potential.
We expect service activities to grow over the 2019-2025 period, with the highest growth rates
coming from industrial gas turbines, in particular in the field of distributed generation, mainlydriven by the expected growth of our installed base as well as growing demand for efficiency-related modernizations and upgrades of our installed fleet. Investments to improve theperformance of existing/brownfield equipment present a capital-effective alternative to thepurchase of new assets to extend equipment lifetime, enhance financial returns and loweremissions. While we expect the solid growth in this area to continue, the current debate aroundclimate change may present an additional upside.
From a regional perspective, we estimate that all three regions will contribute to the growth of
our Addressed Industrial Applications Market, with the strongest growth expected to occur in theAsia, Australia region (with an expected 2019-2025 CAGR of 3.7%, based on our ownassessment). EMEA is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.6% (with Europe and Africa growing from€8.8 billion to €9.6 billion from 2019 to 2025, at a CAGR of 1.5%, and the Middle East growing
from€2.1 billion to €2.4 billion, at a CAGR of 2.2%) and the Americas at a CAGR of 1.1% over
the same period (in each case based on our own assessment).
From a long-term perspective, we see following trends influencing our markets:Driven by continuous demand growth for energy (currently around 850 million people worldwide
have no access to electricity, according to the IEA (source: https://www.iea.org/world)), we expectthat demand for oil and gas will continue to contribute the largest share to the primary energymix at least until 2050. In external analyst scenarios envisaging strong growth of renewables(e.g., IEA, WEO 2019), oil and gas are still expected to contribute a significant share of global
primary energy demand (53% in 2040 under the Stated Policies Scenario, and 47% in 2040 underthe Sustainable Development Scenario). Primary energy consumption is expected to shift to ahigher share of natural gas facilitated by its lower environmental footprint and feedstockavailability, partially at the expense of coal and oil.
Global oil demand is expected to grow from 98.7 thousand barrels of oil per day (“ mb/d ”) in
2018 to 108.3 mb/d in 2030, with the largest growth expected to come from the transportationsector, followed by the industrial sector (and therein, in particular from the petrochemicalsector). Global gas demand is expected to grow from 65.5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent perday (“ mboe/d ”) in 2018 to 79.7 mboe/d in 2030, with demand to come primarily from Asia, led by
China and India, as well as OPEC countries (source for the above information: OPEC, “World OilOutlook 2040”, 2019 edition).
We expect that increasing demand levels for primary energy will translate in robust expenditure
volumes, whereby brownfield expenditure (which amounted to approximately USD 860 billion in2019, or over 80% of total capital and operating expenditure in oil & gas exploration and
253
production, according to the Rystad “ServiceDemandCube” database (retrieved in August 2020),
and which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3% over the 2019-2030 period) shall play a majorrole in order to avoid stranded oil & gas assets, enable a steady return on investment and ensurestability and reliability of energy systems around the world. In turn, declining production frommaturing oil and gas fields (depletion) will require improved recovery technologies as well asadditional mechanical and electrical power requiring continuous investments.
Customers in our Addressed Industrial Applications Market include national and international
oil & gas companies, independent oil & gas producers, specialized midstream companies, oilfieldservice providers, industrial players, EPC companies, packagers, system integrators, distributorsand OEMs. Today’s customer needs are prompting new trends, technologies and solutions in theprocess industries. For example, the oil & gas and the other process industries are experiencing atransformation towards a lower carbon footprint in line with global climate protection policies.We see an increasing focus of operators on emissions reduction and higher operational efficiencyas well as on cost reduction. In oil & gas operations, we also see a growing importance of naturalgas, facilitated by its lower environmental footprint.
In addition, digitalization is widely accepted as a key enabler for operational improvement,
increasing safety, uptime, throughput, and higher productivity (for example, with remotemonitoring and services) as well as reducing emissions.
Moreover, oil & gas customers operate in high-risk environments and thus aim at achieving zero
harm levels, safeguarding security (including cyber security), among others with new de-manningsolutions, virtual solutions for installation, commissioning, training and control rooms as well asrobotics. In order to increase reliability and efficiency while improving risk management, there isa trend to focus on operational efficiency, such as brownfield solutions to extend asset life,service solutions to maximize uptime and an integrated project execution.
Besides a focus on higher efficiency and on reducing the carbon footprint in oil & gas operations,
industry players are developing sector coupling technologies such as hydrogen (see“11.1.3.2.2 Decarbonization ”) and “power-to-x”, facilitated by their infrastructure, feedstock and
technology access, as well as increasing investments into renewables.
In turn, these developments create new growth opportunities for suppliers of the oil & gas and
other process industries, such as Siemens Energy’s Industrial Applications division.
11.4.3 Competitive Environment
We believe the major competitive factors in our Addressed Industrial Applications Market and its
market segments include portfolio coverage, price, life cycle economics, product reliability andavailability, efficiency, emissions footprint, references, ability to match local requirements andstandards, as well as service capabilities. Framework and long-term service agreements contributeto a long-term relationship with customers.
The competitor landscape in our Addressed Industrial Applications Market is complex. Most
companies typically specialize in particular market segments, and some are partially active indifferent market segments, but there are only a few companies that are present across severalvalue chain segments. Siemens Energy’s products, solutions and services address businesses alongthe complete oil & gas value chain (upstream, midstream and downstream) – with the exceptionof upstream exploration and field development and downstream retail and marketing, which arenot core offerings of the Group – as well as in other process industries, as described in thedefinition of our Addressed Industrial Applications Market.
Overall, we believe we are the second largest player in our Addressed Industrial Applications
Market, after Baker Hughes Company, Houston/Texas (United States) (“ Baker Hughes ”) (based on
market value for 2019 for new equipment). Other main relevant competitors in our AddressedIndustrial Applications Market are Solar Turbines Incorporated, a wholly-owned subsidiary ofCaterpillar, Inc., Peoria/Illinois (United States) (“ Solar Turbines ”), MAN SE, Munich (Germany)
(“MAN ”), Ariel Corporation, Mount Vernon/Ohio (United States), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,
Ltd., Tokyo and Yokohama (Japan), ABB, Schneider Electric SE, Rueil-Malmaison (France),
254
Cameron International Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited,
Curac ¸ao (The Netherlands), Honeywell International Inc., Morristown/New Jersey (United States),
Rockwell Automation Inc., Milwaukee/Wisconsin (United States), Yokogawa Denki K.K., Tokyo(Japan), General Electric Co., Boston/Massachusetts (United States), Burckhardt CompressionHolding AG, Winterthur (Switzerland), Atlas Copco AB, Nacka (Sweden), and Elliott Group, asubsidiary of Ebara Corporation, Tokyo (Japan). In addition, we compete with other companies inparticular segments of our Addressed Industrial Applications Market, for example with TeledyneMarine (part of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, Thousand Oaks/California (United States)) inthe field of upstream offshore equipment; Kongsberg Gruppen ASA, Kongsberg (Norway), andWärtsilä, in the field of upstream offshore solutions and marine; Danfoss A/S, Nordborg Sogn(Denmark), and Valmet Corp., Espoo (Finland), in solutions for the fiber industry; and VeoliaEnvironnement S.A., Aubervilliers (France), in the field of water solutions. In our assessment, wewere the second largest player in the market segments for both Products and Solutions of ourAddressed Industrial Applications Market in the fiscal year 2019 (in each case, based on marketvalue for new equipment).
In the service business, we assess that we are the leading provider for our installed fleet of 79,000
service-relevant units, where we compete mainly with independent service providers (“ ISP”) such
as Universal Plant Services Inc., Deer Park/Texas (United States), and Sulzer AG, Winterthur(Switzerland), as well as other regional and local players. For several products, we also facecompetition regarding service activities from the OEMs mentioned further above.
From a regional perspective, we assess that we were the second largest player in each of our main
regions (EMEA, the Americas and Asia, Australia) in the fiscal year 2019 in terms of order intake forproducts and solutions. Within EMEA, we estimate that we were the largest player in the Middle Eastand the second-largest in Europe in the fiscal year 2019, according to the same criteria.
11.5 SGRE Segment: The Wind Energy Market
11.5.1 Introduction
The following description contains an overview of the wind energy market (sometimes also
termed “wind power market” or “wind power industry”), in which SGRE is a leading supplier ofwind turbines and services for both onshore and offshore market segments. Depending onmarket requirements as well as SGRE’s regional or project-specific approach, the scope of SGRE’sinvolvement could vary from project to project, e.g., by undertaking a full EPC scope or wind
power plant development in some cases. SGRE also explores opportunities in adjacent renewablebusiness fields which, in many cases, are also related to the wind turbine business (see“12.4.1.5 New Adjacent Business Fields” ). However, these activities represent only a small fraction
of SGRE’s current business. In general, the market information for these other activities is stillvery limited and less reliable. Thus, they are not discussed in this section.
The global wind market has been growing in the last years, historically driven by subsidies and
other incentive mechanisms (such as feed-in tariffs), with wind now being the leading renewableenergy source driving the decarbonization of the energy sector in terms of investments andpower generation (in TWh). According to BNEF’s “New Energy Outlook 2019” (including theunderlying data set), wind power is expected to attract the largest pool of investments in theperiod from 2020 to 2040 among renewables, with investments in the wind energy sectorexpected to amount, on average, to approximately USD 178 billion per year over this time period.By contrast, the other main renewable energy sources, i.e., solar PV, hydro, biomass and
geothermal, are expected to account for investments averaging around USD 135 billion,USD 25 billion, USD 4 billion and USD 1 billion per year, respectively, over the 2020-2040 period,according to the same source (all based on 2018 USD values). Technological progress has led to arapid decline in the levelized cost of energy (for more information, see “ 11.5.2.5 Cost Trends ”),
which is widely expected to lead to a further proliferation of onshore and offshore wind powerplants (for more information on the expected market development for onshore and offshorenew equipment and services, see “ 11.5.3 Market Size and Development ”).

Market shares foronshore and offshore (New Unit market segment, as defined below) provided in this section arebased on Wood Mackenzie data. For all wind markets with the exception of China, WoodMackenzie considers data relating to grid-connected capacity; the calculation of market sharesfor a given year in such markets is based on the grid-connection of individual turbines regardlessof the fact that the entire wind power plant may not be fully connected by the end of such year.For China, Wood Mackenzie’s data is based on installed wind turbines (mechanically erected). Forservices, the analysis is based on O&M revenues (or revenue opportunities for future periods)expressed in €or USD billion, depending on the case, according to Wood Mackenzie data.
11.5.2 General Market Characteristics, Trends and Drivers
Besides the general trends relating to the transformation of the energy markets (see
“11.1.3.2 Energy Trends and Transformation of Energy Markets ”), the following trends specific to
wind power play an important role in the wind energy market.
11.5.2.1 Trends Relating to Market Mechanisms
In general, there are three different types of market mechanisms currently employed to develop
wind power projects: feed-in-tariffs (“ FIT”), auctions and so-called “merchant projects” based on
commercial parameters, for example “corporate power purchase agreements” (“ corporate
PPAs ”) or the sale of power directly into the wholesale market.
Historically, aside from other subsidy measures, e.g., tax credits or green certificates, FIT policy
has played a very important role in accelerating the investments in renewable energy globally.Long-term contracts with guaranteed tariff rates under such a mechanism provided investorshigh certainty on the return.
As the renewable energy sector matures, policies need to be adapted to reflect changing market
conditions, new technical and socioeconomic challenges, and the need for integration into theoverall energy system. One important trend has been the increasing use of auctions instead of FITframeworks, as policy makers seek to procure electricity based on renewables at the lowestpossible price, while simultaneously fulfilling other social or economic objectives, such as local jobcreation.
Renewable energy auctions are becoming widely adopted, owing mainly to their ability to reveal
competitive prices. Moreover, flexibility in their design allows them to be tailored to country-specific conditions and objectives beyond price discovery. According to IRENA’s report entitled“Renewable Energy Auctions – Status and Trends Beyond Price”, December 2019, in 2017-2018,some 55 countries used auctions to procure renewables-based electricity, raising the number ofcountries that have held at least one auction for renewables at any time and until the end of2018 to 106 (compared to eight countries in 2005). According to the same source, one-third ofthe 55 countries had no previous experience with auctions. This often led to certain marketfrictions regarding the first auctions.
The transition towards affordable, reliable and sustainable energy systems is being accompanied
not only by better demand prospects for renewable installations but also by the demand for
256
greater competitiveness in the supply chain: more productive wind turbines at better prices. The
introduction of auctions as a mechanism for allocating renewable capacity or production inelectricity markets, pressure from alternative renewable sources to wind energy, and thecompetitive pressure among wind turbine manufacturers themselves are the main reasons for thereduction in prices. For more information on wind turbine pricing trends for onshore andoffshore turbines, see “ 11.5.3.1.2 Market Development ” and “ 11.5.3.2.2 Market Development ”,
respectively.
In most of the countries, the introduction of auctions has led to a sharp decrease of tariffs. For
example, in the very first round of an onshore wind auction in India in 2017, a record low pricewas set (source: BNEF, “Climatescope 2017 – India: Country Snapshot”, November 2017). Afurther reduction of approximately 30% was seen in the following rounds. In the UnitedKingdom, the clearing prices for offshore wind projects out of the latest round of a Contract forDifferences (“ CfD”) auction in 2019 set another low record – between GBP 39 and GBP 42 per
MW hour (“ MWh ”). This is around 30% lower than the clearing prices from the previous auction
held in the United Kingdom in 2017. With the global transition to auctions largely completed,the wind energy market has seen a stabilization of price levels in recent auctions in severalcountries. This trend has been maintained so far in 2020, according to our observations.
The attractive auction prices have in return triggered discussions on a further increase of the
national target volumes for wind energy, resulting, for example, in an increase of the U.K. 2030offshore target from 30 GW to 40 GW (as announced by the U.K. government in December 2019)and the increase of the German 2030 offshore wind capacity target from 15 GW to 20 GW (asagreed by the German federal government, the German coastal states and the TSOs in May2019).
Besides wind power-specific auctions, several countries have also introduced technology-neutral
auctions, where different technologies compete with each other directly. In such cases, we seeespecially strong competition between wind energy and PV.
With the continuous decrease of costs, renewable energy is becoming increasingly attractive, not
only from the point of view of decarbonization, but also economically. This has triggeredincreasing volumes of so-called “corporate PPAs”. Under this model, which may take differentforms, corporates enter into agreements to source energy directly from the asset owner, oftenwith the participation of one or more banks or investors as financing partners. This model is usedin particular by large corporations in North America and Northern Europe. According to BNEF’sarticle “Corporate Clean Energy Buying Leapt 44% in 2019, Sets New Record”, January 28, 2020,some 19.5 GW of clean energy contracts were signed by more than 100 corporations in 23different countries in 2019. This is a significant increase of more than 40% compared to the 13.6GW in 2018, and more than triple the activity seen in 2017, according to the same source.
It must be noted that a combination of the different mechanisms is also possible, e.g., some
developers participate in auctions with part of the total project capacities and rely on thewholesale market for the remaining capacities.
11.5.2.2 Customer Trends
According to Wood Mackenzie’s “2019 Global Wind Power Asset Ownership Report” (“ GWPA
Ownership Report ”), independent power producers, including those that are utility-affiliated
(together, “ IPP”) were by far the largest group of owners of newly-built wind projects in 2018
(approximately 59% of total 2018 new build). Commercial and industrial asset owners (“ C&I”) as
well as institutional investors are other relevant customer groups, with a 16% and 10% share in2018, respectively. The split differs significantly from region to region. While C&I asset ownersare predominantly seen in Asia, Australia, especially in China, institutional investors are mostlylocated in the Americas and Europe. According to the same source, the top 25 owners worldwideaccounted, in the aggregate, for almost half of global wind capacity additions in 2018. The list ofthe largest owners is dominated by Chinese state-owned companies, whose activities mainlyconcentrate within China.
257
Regarding future development, according to the GWPA Ownership Report, although IPPs are
expected to remain the largest group in terms of wind power asset ownership, their total sharein new wind projects is expected to decrease to approximately 50% in 2023. The anticipatedincrease of the share of C&I asset owners by approximately 10 percentage points by 2023 ismainly expected to result from the expected growth of China’s state-owned flagship assetowners.
As mentioned above under “ 11.5.2.1 Trends Relating to Market Mechanisms” , one major
customer trend that can be observed for the last few years is the increasing volume of corporatePPAs, driven by decarbonization considerations as well as by the high competitiveness ofrenewable energy. Examples of customers with corporate PPAs from various industries include,among others: (i) in energy-intensive industries, Norsk Hydro and Alcoa, (ii) in the softwareindustry, Google and Microsoft, and (iii) in the consumer goods industry, Nike and Procter &Gamble. Many of those customers have set ambitious 100% renewable targets (see, for example,those mentioned under “ 11.1.3.2 Energy Trends and Transformation of Energy Markets ” and
“11.1.3.2.2 Decarbonization ”).
In addition, traditional oil & gas companies are becoming increasingly active in the renewable
energy business. In light of the global trend of decarbonization, these companies face multiplechallenges, including changing policies, growth limitations and investor preferences shiftingtowards low-carbon businesses. As a response, oil & gas companies today are not only purchasingpower from renewable sources but are increasingly engaged in the development of renewableprojects. For example, Shell has defined offshore wind as a key growth area and is active in thedevelopment of multiple projects in Europe and the United States. Furthermore, Total has set anambitious target aiming for 25 GW installed power generation capacity from renewable sourcesby 2025.
11.5.2.3 Product and Service Trends
One of the major long-term product trends that can be observed in the past years is the
continuous increase of average wind turbine capacity, rotor diameter as well as hub height as ameans to decrease the cost of installation and O&M per MWh produced. For example, foronshore wind in the United States, according to the American Wind Energy Association(“AWEA ”)‘s “Wind Powers America Annual Report 2019”, April 2020 (“ AWEA 2019 Report ”), the
average rated (nameplate) capacity of the newly installed wind turbines in the United States in2019 was 2.55 MW, a 5% increase compared to 2018. The average hub height of turbinesinstalled in the United States in 2019 was 90 meters, up by 2.2% compared to the previous year,according to the same source. Average rotor diameters have increased at a more rapid pace thanhub heights over the long-term. The average rotor diameter of wind turbines installed in 2019was 121 meters, an increase of 4.3% over the previous year and a 46% increase compared toaverage rotor diameters deployed back in 2010 (source: AWEA 2019 Report and, for the 2018figure, AWEA’s Annual Market Report 2018, published in 2019). Furthermore, the fastintroduction of the 4MW+ platforms is expected to accelerate this trend. In Europe, the averagerated capacity of offshore turbines installed in 2019 was 7.8 MW, 1 MW more than in 2018(source: Wind Europe, “Offshore Wind in Europe – Key trends and statistics 2019”, February2020). On average, turbine capacity in Europe has increased by 16% every year since 2014,according to the same source. According to Wood Mackenzie’s “Global wind turbine technologytrends 2019”, December 2019, the average turbine ratings from all major turbine OEMs are set todouble in this decade, both for the onshore and offshore market segments, partly due tofavorable cost implications for project balance of plant. In addition, according to WoodMackenzie’s “Global Wind Turbine Technology Market Report 2018”, geared systems arebecoming the preferred choice for onshore wind turbines, while direct drive is the preferredchoice in the offshore sector, mainly due to reliability considerations, and also since the cost ofgearbox repairs offshore would be too high.
Global OEMs usually have broad product portfolios covering diverse markets with different wind
conditions (for an explanation of different wind classes, see “ 12.4.1.1 Overview of Wind
Class Classification ”). For example, according to Wood Mackenzie’s “Global Wind Turbine
258
Technology Market Report 2018”, wind turbine OEMs are working on certain design
modifications of the existing turbines to meet typhoon class certifications, and also floatingoffshore turbines show potential for use in typhoon prone areas. In addition, customization iscritical to project performance and developer profitability. OEMs need to deliver regionallytailored platforms harnessing modular design concepts to fill that need. Achieving greatereconomies of scale via standard component sourcing and optimizing global production strategieswill be essential for OEM profitability.
In general terms, the majority of wind power plant services are provided by wind turbine
OEMs. While some larger customers tend to build own service capabilities and capacities, majorOEMs with a broad service offering, extensive know-how and a competitive supply chain can bean efficient option for services also for those larger customers. In addition, software and digitalalgorithms are migrating from the wind power plant level and gaining traction at the turbinelevel as well. The evolution of digital technology has led to a proliferation of services across theO&M value chain. The most basic digital technologies include remote monitoring and diagnostictools to identify turbine failures, conduct basic site and turbine performance assessment, andgenerate reports. These tools are now ubiquitous, and nearly all asset managers deploy basicdigital technology in some form or another. More advanced technology incorporates dataanalytics and machine learning to provide some form of early-warning predictive analyticsaround component failure.
11.5.2.4 Supply Chain Trends
Each wind turbine OEM has its own strategy with respect to in-house manufacturing and/or
outsourcing as well as its global footprint to satisfy its demand in a cost-effective approach. Anincreasing trend of outsourcing can be observed in the industry with the main goal being tolower costs and increase flexibility.
Due to the high local demand in China as well as the high competitiveness of the local supply
chain, a significant portion of global wind power supply chain is located in China. In recent years,the trend of supply chain migration to best-cost countries in the Asia, Australia region hasintensified as OEMs and their suppliers further exploit the cost saving and volume potential thatmay be achieved by relocating production resources to these countries, with an aim to serve bothdomestic and export markets.
In order to support local employment, local content policies for wind power development have
been introduced by several countries/regions across the globe. Examples include Turkey, Russiaand Brazil, to name a few. Local content requirements are also seen in emerging offshoremarkets, such as Taiwan, France and the United States. For some key components, a high degreeof concentration is observed. For example, in 2019, regarding third-party blade supply, thetop-five independent blade suppliers had a combined share of 79% of this market segment, andfor gearboxes, the top-three suppliers had a combined share of 81% of the total wind turbinegearbox market segment in the same year (source: Wood Mackenzie, “Global wind turbinesupply chain trends 2020”, March 2020).
In recent years, a clear trend towards the integration of the sustainability policy into the overall
company strategy can be observed in the wind industry. Several major wind turbine OEMs haveset company-specific goals related to the reduction of their carbon footprint or waste out ofproduction. Furthermore, they also have extended their environmental, social and governance(“ESG”) targets to their supply chain, including requiring strict compliance with their code of
conduct, emission/waste reduction policies, etc.
11.5.2.5 Cost Trends
Traditionally, the cost development of wind power can be measured by the so-called “Levelized
Cost of Energy” (“ LCoE ”), which is a standard power industry metric used to measure the total
cost of power generation averaged per MWh over a project’s lifetime. LCoE is calculated bydividing the sum of all costs over a project’s lifetime (capital and operational expenditures) bythe sum of electrical energy produced over the project’s lifetime. It allows the comparison of
259
different technologies ( e.g., wind, solar, natural gas) of unequal life spans, project size, different
capital cost, risk, return and capacities.
According to the “BNEF 2H 2019 LCoE Update”, October 22, 2019 (“ BNEF LCoE Update Report ”),
the global BNEF benchmark LCoE for new-build onshore wind projects was at USD 47 in thesecond half of 2019, which was 6% less than in the first half of 2019. This was mainly due to costreduction in equipment. In turn, offshore wind has seen the fastest cost declines in the secondhalf of 2019, according to the same source, down 32% compared to the second half of 2018 and12% from compared to the first half of 2019. BNEF’s latest global benchmark estimate wasUSD 78/MWh, as per the same report (as of its date).
The following chart shows the development of LCoE for onshore and offshore wind, as well as
for PV, in USD per MWh, from the second half of 2009 until the second half of 2019:

Source: BNEF LCoE Update Report. The global LCoE benchmark shown for onshore and offshore wind as well as for PV (no
tracking) is the country weighted-average using the latest annual capacity additions.
Note: The reference “PV, no tracking” refers to those PV devices that do not have a tracking system oriented towards the sun
(i.e., that do not change their position to “track” the sun). “1H” and “2H” refer to the first and second halves,
respectively, of the calendar year mentioned.
According to the BNEF LCoE Update Report, PV and onshore wind are winning the race as the
cheapest sources of new bulk generation with two-thirds of the world population living incountries where PV or wind is the cheapest new electricity generation. The same source estimatesthat onshore wind LCoE will reach levels ranging from roughly USD 30 to USD 35/MWh incountries such as Australia, Germany and the United States by the end of the current decade. Inaddition, BNEF anticipates a continuous decrease of offshore wind LCoE, expected to reachapproximately USD 50/MWh in the United Kingdom or Germany by the end of current decade(source: BNEF LCoE Update Report), driven mainly by the increasing capacity factor of windturbines, which enable lower capital expenditures per MW as well as reduced operationalexpenditures. The BNEF LCoE Update Report projects a global offshore LCoE benchmark ofUSD 52.3/MWh for 2029.
11.5.2.6 Recent Trends related to the Integration of Renewables
Rising shares of renewable energy continue to transform energy systems around the world. In
recent years, many countries have seen significant growth in installed capacity and generationfrom sources of variable renewable energy (“ VRE”). According to REN21’s “Renewables 2020
Global Status Report”, June 2020 (“ REN21 2019 Report ”), in 2019, at least eight countries
supplied more than 20% of their electricity generation from the main VRE sources wind and solarPV, while some countries have seen rapid annual growth of VRE penetration. Power systems areadapting to rising shares of VRE through a range of measures, as further stated in the REN212020 Report: Countries and sub-national entities are directing their policy efforts to ensuring thesuccessful integration of VRE into the wider energy system and drawing on a wide variety offlexibility resources including power market design, grid extension, forecasting and demandresponse. In addition, policies for systems integration of renewables and enabling technologies
260
(such as energy storage) are focused primarily on increasing power system flexibility and control,
as well as grid resilience. In 2019, policies to advance the integration of VRE related mainly tomarket design, demand-side management, transmission and distribution system enhancements,grid interconnections and support for energy storage. Much of the policy development occurredin Europe and at state level in the United States, according to the same source.
Energy storage can help smooth the output from renewable power facilities and minimize
curtailment. Total installed capacity for pumped-storage hydropower, the largest contributor tothe global energy storage stock, stood at 158 GW at the end of the year (with 0.3 GW of newpumped storage capacity added during the year, after a significant increase of 1.9 GW in 2018);significant new capacity was being planned, in part to support growth in VRE from solar PV andwind power. The leading markets for battery storage ( i.e., Korea, China, the United States and
Germany) had mixed results in 2019, while renewables-plus-storage has emerged as a majordriver of battery market growth. The energy storage industry saw significant cost improvements,increased manufacturing capacity, large investments and ongoing R&D during 2019, with manyof these activities focused on short-duration storage applications and battery technologies(source for all statements: REN21 2020 Report, except for pumped-storage hydropower capacityadditions in 2018, which are taken from REN21’s “Renewables 2019 Global Status Report”, June2019).
Governments are increasingly incorporating the demand for integration into their overall system
design, a trend also mentioned in the REN21 2020 Report. For example, in August 2019, theIndian government issued for the first time a tender for setting up 1.2 GW of renewable projectsincluding an energy storage system which will enable the bidders to deliver firm renewableenergy. The tender was concluded in January 2020 and competitive rates have been achieved,which are even below the level of new thermal power generation. In addition, several plans tolaunch offshore wind projects in connection with green hydrogen have been revealed recently.Although such plans are rather long-term and depend, among other things, on permits fromgovernments, the assignment of new wind power plant locations, the available locations for thehydrogen facilities and the final investment decisions of the parties concerned, they show a clearindustry ambition and an effort towards holistic solutions for decarbonization.
11.5.3 Market Size and Development
In general terms, the wind energy market includes both the “ New Unit ” market segment and the
“Service ” market segment. The New Unit market segment relates to new wind assets installed; it
is sometimes also referred to by some wind turbine OEMs as “wind turbine generator business”or “equipment business” to differentiate from the service business. The Service market segmentrelates to the O&M of wind assets during the whole project lifetime. While the New Unit marketsegment is exclusively served by wind power OEMs, different types of players are active in theService market segment, including wind turbine OEMs, asset owners and ISP, among others.
In turn, the New Unit and Service market segments may refer to onshore or offshore wind
projects. Onshore and offshore wind projects differ significantly in some aspects, for examplewith respect to project lead times, cost structure or O&M characteristics. In general, onshore windprojects have lead times that are typically lower than a year (but this may vary depending on theproject) while offshore wind projects have a much longer planning period, due to the morecomprehensive permitting process, more complex grid connection requirements and otherfactors. For example, six projects totaling 5,466 MW were awarded in the 2019 auction in theUnited Kingdom (CfD Round 3). The expected delivery year for such projects, however, rangesbetween 2023 and 2025. From a cost perspective, onshore turbine costs typically account for amuch larger portion of a project’s capital expenditures than offshore turbines, mainly due to themuch lower cost of the foundation, cables, substation or for the grid connection than foroffshore wind turbines. For example, the share of costs of a 4 MW onshore turbine within aproject’s capital expenditures in the EMEARC region (Europe, Middle East, Africa, Russia and theCaspian states) was estimated at approximately 80%, while the cost share of a 10 MW offshoreturbine was estimated at only approximately 50% of a project’s capital expenditures in thatregion (source: Wood Mackenzie, “Global wind turbine technology trends 2018”, December
261
2018). From a service point of view, since offshore wind projects are built further away from the
shore, appropriate logistic and transport solutions are crucial to access the turbines to carry outservice activities. Due to the higher effort required to conduct on-site service activities in offshoreprojects, condition monitoring systems have currently near 100% adoption rate in offshore wind,which enables digital and data-based technology for preventive maintenance and an overallimproved service strategy. The economic motivation to pursue such more complex investments inoffshore is the high availability of the wind resource and LCoE decreasing with increasingexperience, more advanced technologies and the development of the supply chain.
The wind energy market is a global industry. According to the REN21 2019 Report, at least 103
countries had commercial wind power capacity at the end of 2018, and 33 countries had morethan 1 GW in operation.
According to Wood Mackenzie’s “Global Wind Power Market Outlook Update / Q2 2020”, 62 GW
of new capacity was added globally in 2019, representing a 23% increase compared to globalcapacity additions in 2018. The growth trend is expected to continue, with nearly 77 GW ofannual wind power capacity addition expected globally from 2020 to 2029 (on average).According to the same source, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the yearly newinstallations is mainly to be expected in the onshore New Unit market segment. While theCOVID-19 pandemic caused delays in 2020, most of the affected capacity merely shifted from2020 into 2021 and 2022. However, in some countries, for example in India, the lockdown due tothe COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating ongoing structural issues, which could have a potentialnegative effect on this regional wind market’s development.
Further details are included in the following description of the New Unit onshore and offshore
market segments.
11.5.3.1 New Unit Market Segment - Onshore
11.5.3.1.1 IntroductionAccording to the “Global Wind Report 2019” published by the GWEC in March 2020 (“ GWR
2019 ”), the installed capacity of land-based wind turbines surpassed 600 GW by the end of 2019,
with China and the United States accounting for more than 50% of total (cumulative) installedcapacity. These two countries also accounted for 60% of capacity additions in 2019 (whichamounted globally to 54.2 GW), according to the same source. Global onshore wind installationshave tripled during the past decade, as shown by the historical data included in the GWR 2019,with the sector reaching further maturity.
Onshore wind turbines cover broad market requirements: from ultra-low wind sites in China and
India to high wind sites in the Nordics or Brazil. The adaptation of hub height, rotor size andturbine capacity to site-specific wind conditions, legal requirements and logistic constraints ishighly relevant for project performance and profitability. Incremental improvements in turbinetechnology, manufacturing and logistics have increased the size of modern onshore turbines toup to 6 MW nameplate capacity. The scale of onshore wind projects varies significantly: fromsingle-digit-MW projects for small local accounts to GW-range projects for large global utility orinstitutional accounts.
11.5.3.1.2 Market Development
The onshore wind market has shown a strong overall growth trend in the last years with an
overall CAGR of 3% between 2016 and 2019 in terms of new annual installations, according toWood Mackenzie’s “Global Wind Power Market Outlook Update: Q2 2020”, June 2020. However,the year-on-year variations are significant, mainly driven by policy changes in major countries,especially in China and the United States.

Note: “RoW” means “rest of the world” ( i.e., the countries other than China).
The onshore market is expected to remain a very large market, as shown by the chart above.
Currently, repowering is in general still less frequent than life extensions, since generally little ofan old project’s original infrastructure can be used as part of a potential full repowering, and thedecommissioning, reconstruction and deployment of modern equipment related to repowering(including planning and engineering costs associated with using larger and more efficientturbines) are often not cost-effective when compared to building a completely new greenfieldproject. However, when product life extensions are exhausted and as obtaining greenfieldpermits in suitable locations becomes more difficult, repowering could become increasinglyattractive.
China is by far the largest single-country market for onshore wind power, accounting for
approximately 42% of the global new onshore capacity in 2019, according to Wood Mackenzie’s“Global Wind Power Market Outlook Update: Q2 2020”.
From a global perspective, the peak expected for 2020-2021 is mainly driven by two factors: China is experiencing a crucial period of regulatory reform. The Chinese government only
allows projects to receive FIT if they have been approved until 2018 and get grid-connectedbefore the end of 2020. This policy shift, together with the improvement of curtailment in thecountry, has resulted in an installation boost in 2019 and 2020. According to Wood Mackenzie’s“Global Wind Power Market Outlook Update: Q2 2020”, China’s industry has recovered sincethe lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, according to the same source, Chinesewind power manufacturers are again producing at full capacity, and logistics are stillrecovering, supported by provincial governments. However, some risk lingers as developersrush to capitalize on the expiring FIT subsidy in 2020, yet are exposed to foreign suppliers thathave not yet fully recovered from COVID-19 standstill.
 In the United States, in May 2020, the U.S. administration announced a one-year extension of
the original deadline for onshore wind developers who started construction of projects in 2016or 2017 to complete and qualify them for federal Production Tax Credit (“ PTC”) value at full or
80% value (the new deadlines are the end of 2021 or 2022 for full or 80% PTC value,respectively) in recognition of delays from COVID-19 impacts to supply chains and workforces.They will now have five years, instead of four years, to complete construction without havingto prove continuous work on the projects after construction began. The planned stepwisephase-out of PTC is expected to have a major impact on the U.S. market volume until 2024.However, according to Wood Mackenzie’s “Global Wind Power Market Outlook Update: Q22020”, on the one hand, the positive effect in terms of capacity gains relating to such deadlineextensions was balanced out in its global outlook by downgrades in countries such as Canadaor Mexico (which experienced certain policy shifts undermining renewables) or India, among
263
others. On the other hand, according to the same source, confidence in the United States
results, for example, form repowering, i.e., the upgrading to larger, taller and more efficient
turbines, as well as software improvements or replacement of specific components, such asblades (partial repowering).
In the longer-term, the continuous growth of onshore installations in other regions is expected to
maintain the overall global installation at a stable high level. For example, EMEARC is forecastedto grow at a CAGR of approximately 8.5% between 2019 and 2025 (source: Wood Mackenzie,“Global Wind Power Market Outlook Update: Q2 2020”). The Indian New Unit onshore marketsegment is expected to grow significantly to approximately 5 GW (annually) by 2025, after a lowlevel of installations in 2018 and 2019 (of 2.3 GW and 2.4 GW, respectively), according to thesame source. However, as previously mentioned, India has experienced structural issues in recenttimes, which resulted in the Indian market not meeting expectations in terms of installations.
Prices for wind turbines are usually measured in €or USD per MW. However, such prices are
highly dependent on the supply scope, regional mix and platform mix, among other factors. Dueto the continuous progress in technology improvement and industrialization, onshore turbineprices have dropped significantly in the last decade, and in particular in recent years, especially inconnection with the global transition into auctions. In the last year, with the global transition toauction systems being largely completed, the market has seen an overall stabilization of onshorewind turbine selling prices. In some markets, a strong price rebound has been reported over thepast months, for example in China, driven in part by a short-term demand surge as well as theprice increase of components and raw materials.
Beyond 2025, we expect the global onshore market to grow until 2030 at a 2025-2030 CAGR of
approximately 3%, to reach approximately 67 GW of new installations in 2030, based on WoodMackenzie data for 2025-2029 (underlying data set for the “Global Wind Power Market OutlookUpdate: Q2 2020” report) and SGRE’s estimate for 2030 based on Wood Mackenzie’s outlook for2029.
11.5.3.2 New Unit Market Segment – Offshore
11.5.3.2.1 IntroductionAccording to the GWR 2019, the installed (cumulated) capacity of offshore wind turbines
surpassed 29 GW by the end of 2019, with approximately 75% thereof located in North-WesternEurope (mostly in the United Kingdom and Germany, but also in Belgium, Denmark and TheNetherlands). The total global installed capacity has doubled within the last three years (from 14GW of installed offshore capacity at the end of 2016). With the high momentum in new offshoremarkets like Taiwan and USA, offshore wind is well on track towards globalization.
Offshore wind projects normally enjoy higher wind speed and less volatile wind conditions
compared to onshore sites. The project capacity factors are thus also higher compared to mostonshore projects. Due to the high cost of the “balance of plant” portion ( i.e., the portion that is
not related to the wind turbine itself, but rather to supporting components and auxiliarysystems) and high service effort in offshore projects, the advantages for using turbines withhigher nameplate capacity is more imminent. Most of the turbines offered today have nameplatecapacities in the range of 6.0 MW to 14.0 MW. The average project size for offshore wind energyis significantly larger than those for onshore and there is a clear trend pointing to a furtherincrease of project sizes. For example, the newly-commissioned Hornsea One offshore windpower plant has a total capacity of 1.2 GW and the even larger Hornsea Two project with 1.4 GWtotal capacity is currently under construction.
11.5.3.2.2 Market Development
In general, the offshore wind market segment is well on track to develop from a niche market
segment towards a key pillar of the future global energy mix. The chart below shows an
264
overview of the development of new annual offshore installations from 2016 to 2019 as well as
the forecast until 2025 based on Wood Mackenzie data:

Source: Wood Mackenzie, “Global Wind Power Market Update: Q2 2020”, June 2020 (including related dataset) for 2016-2025F
figures.
Note: “RoW” means “rest of the world” ( i.e., the countries other than China).
In the 2016-2019 period, offshore wind volumes have been mostly concentrated in three main
countries: the United Kingdom (approximately 5.0 GW of new offshore installations), Germany(approximately 4.2 GW) and China (approximately 5.1 GW). Most of the projects installed in thisperiod were subsidized by governments through FIT. It is to note that China took over the firstposition of annual offshore installations in 2018 and kept it in 2019 (source for all data: WoodMackenzie, “Global Wind Power Market Outlook Update: Q1 2020”).
In the 2020-2025 period, according to Wood Mackenzie’s “Global Wind Power Market Outlook
Update: Q2 2020” (underlying data files), despite the strong growth of emerging markets, theoffshore market segment is expected to remain largely concentrated. China is expected toaccount for approximately 33% of total new offshore installations (with a total of approximately22 GW over the 2020-2025 period). Europe, led by the United Kingdom (with approximately11 GW), is expected to install a total of approximately 26 GW over the same period (representingapproximately 39% of global installations in the forecast period).
The strong growth from 2019 to 2025 (with a 22% CAGR) and beyond is well supported by a
large project pipeline as well as diverse country-specific offshore targets. According to the WoodMackenzie data, more than 80% of the forecasted capacity expected to be installed between2019 and 2025 has already been awarded (source: article entitled “WoodMac: Global OffshoreWind Capacity to Rise Sevenfold by 2028”, published online in Greentech Media (a WoodMackenzie business) on February 13, 2020). According to Wood Mackenzie’s “Global Wind PowerMarket Outlook Update: Q2 2020” published in June 2020, including a consideration of potentialeffects of, among others, the COVID-19 pandemic, offshore wind capacity additions from 2020 to2025 is expected to stand largely resilient overall, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Like onshore, China’s offshore market segment is also in transition from FIT to auctions.
According to a government regulation published in 2019, offshore projects approved before theend of 2018 are eligible for the previous FIT of CNY 0.85/kWh, provided that the project is fullygrid-connected before the end of 2021. Furthermore, the Chinese central government hasannounced that it will stop subsidizing offshore wind from 2022 onward, but subsidies providedby provincial governments are likely in order to provide continuity in support for offshore winddevelopment. Accordingly, an installation boost is expected for 2020 and 2021.
The ramp-up of the U.S. offshore market segment (with approximately 9 GW new installations
expected over the 2020-2025 period) is supported by the Investment Tax Credit (“ ITC”) rolled out
at a federal level and the individual state commitments secured with corporate PPAs. Accordingto Wood Mackenzie’s “Global Wind Power Market Outlook Update: Q2 2020”, COVID-19compounds bureaucratic delays in the United States, but the U.S. offshore market also sees apositive effect on its outlook due to New York’s commitment to a procurement of up to 2.5 GW
265
by 2021. The Taiwanese offshore market segment (with expected new offshore installations of
approximately 5.5 GW over the 2020-2025 period) is supported by a FIT scheme based on acompetitive tender mechanism.
In addition, in recent auctions in North-Western Europe, several subsidy-free bids have been
awarded, e.g., in connection with the Hollandse Kust Zuid projects in The Netherlands. This
reflects, on one side, the high competitiveness of the technology and, on the other side, therequirements of continuous innovation and productivity improvement.
Similar as for onshore, offshore wind turbine prices have also a seen significant drop over the last
decade, especially in connection with the transition to auctions. However, the impact of theindividual project scope ( e.g., offshore logistics), plays a significant role in the price of offshore
turbines. Furthermore, the continuous technology development may enable an upgrade of theturbine with higher nameplate capacity without a significant change of the overall turbinedesign and components.
Beyond 2025, we expect the global offshore market to grow until 2030 at a 2025-2030 CAGR of
approximately 7%, to reach approximately 28 GW of new installations in 2030, based on WoodMackenzie data for 2025-2029 (underlying data set for the “Global Wind Power Market OutlookUpdate: Q2 2020” report) and SGRE’s estimate for 2030.
11.5.3.3 Service Market Segment
11.5.3.3.1 IntroductionTo ensure that the asset owner gets the optimal performance out of the wind turbines
throughout the lifetime, proper O&M work needs to be carried out along the full duration of theproject. The Service market segment relating to the wind energy market is referred to as “O&Mmarket” by industry research companies such as Wood Mackenzie and also as “O&M marketsegment” hereinafter. O&M mainly includes activities such as scheduled turbine maintenance,remote monitoring, minor and major corrective work, spare parts, upgrades as well as “balanceof plant” maintenance. It includes both scheduled tasks and ad-hoc repair work. The O&Mbusiness supplies service providers with predictable revenue and cash streams due to therecurring nature of the business and the long contracts commonly seen in this market segment.For most wind turbine OEMs, the service (O&M) business provides higher margins compared tothe New Unit business.
According to Wood Mackenzie’s “2019 Global Onshore Wind Operations & Maintenance (O&M)
Report”, December 2019, and “Offshore Wind Operations and Maintenance Trends 2019”, April2019 (when referred together, hereinafter the “ 2019 O&M Reports ”), 64% of the 2018 global
onshore O&M market segment and 71% of the 2018 European offshore O&M market segmentwere served by wind turbine OEMs (excluding multi-vendor OEMs). For the past few years, someglobal customers with a large installed wind turbine fleet have been adopting the strategy toinsource O&M activities. Some even provide service activities to other asset owners as ISPs.According to Wood Mackenzie, the share of in-house service for onshore is expected to increasefrom 24% in 2018 to 31% in 2028. Other players active in the O&M market segment are ISPs,which had a relatively low global market share in 2018. According to Wood Mackenzie, the shareof ISPs service for is expected to increase from 8% in 2018 to 10% in 2028 (source: 2019 O&MReports).
266
11.5.3.3.2 Market Development
The O&M market size has increased from approximately €11 billion in 2016 to approximately
€15 billion in 2019 (representing a 10% CAGR for 2016-2019), and is expected to increase further
to approximately €24 billion in 2025, according to Wood Mackenzie data, as shown in the chart

The overall increasing fleet size as well as the increasing average ages of the global fleet are the
two main drivers behind the growth, according to the same sources. For onshore, the totalinstalled fleet is expected to surpass 900 GW by 2025, which is roughly a 50% increase comparedto 2019 (approximately 600 GW). For offshore, the projected growth rate is even higher, at morethan 200% from approximately 29 GW in 2019 to above 90 GW in 2025. With respect to ageingfleets, in the United States, for example, the share of onshore fleet with more than ten years ofage is expected to increase from approximately 20% in 2019 to more than 40% in 2025. InEurope, the share of the total offshore fleet with more than ten years of age is expected toincrease from approximately 5% in 2019 to approximately 15% in 2025. The relatively low shareof aged fleet in Europe in 2025 reflects the high installation rate expected in the upcoming years.(The sources for all the information included in this paragraph are Wood Mackenzie’s 2019 O&MReports.)
In the onshore O&M market segment, all regions are expected to show growth in terms of
market size. Key countries in the Asia, Australia region, i.e., China, India or Australia, are
expected to grow at a CAGR of around 10%, 12% and 9%, respectively, from 2019 to 2025, whilethe markets of early-entrants like Spain, Germany or the United Kingdom show a low-single-digitgrowth rate (source: CAGR calculations based on data (in USD) for the named countries takenfrom Wood Mackenzie’s “2019 Global Onshore Wind Operations & Maintenance Report”). Withrespect to China, the end of FIT by the end of 2020 is a major O&M market driver, as oncomingsubsidy-free operations are forcing asset owners to adapt their onshore operations. In addition,continued reliability issues from first-generation wind turbine models, in particular as the fleetages, is expected to drive demand for major corrective repairs. Overall, O&M onshore activities inChina are expected to reach approximately €2.9 billion in 2025.
According to the same source, in offshore, Europe is expected to remain the overall largest
regional O&M market segment in 2025, with a share of more than 60% of the global offshoreO&M market segment, but the Asia, Australia region is expected to grow rapidly, especiallydriven by China (source: Wood Mackenzie, “Offshore Wind Operations and Maintenance Trends2019”, data in euro). The steady and significant growth expected for the offshore O&M marketsegment in China over the upcoming years is driven by the high installation volumes and the factthat for offshore wind power plant operation it is particularly important to keep a very high levelof reliability.
267
The global transition from FIT to auctions also adds significant pressure on the price level of the
O&M business. Furthermore, the service price per MW is further decreasing due to the globalshift to turbines with larger nameplate capacity. Digitalization and data-driven O&M areexpected to gain further importance as a crucial response to continuous cost pressure. Whilemost OEMs offer basic digital products around diagnostics for the main turbine components,advanced offerings around predictive maintenance and component failure forecasting areoffered by the top industry players. Furthermore, the REN21 2019 Report observes that majormanufacturers, including SGRE, among others, are increasingly focusing on the repoweringmarket segment.
Beyond 2025, we expect the global service (O&M) market to grow until 2030 at a 2025-2030
CAGR of approximately 8%, to reach approximately €35 billion in 2030, based on Wood
Mackenzie data for 2025-2028 (underlying data set for 2019 O&M Reports) and SGRE’s estimatefor 2029 and 2030.
11.5.4 Competitive Environment
By the end of 2019, there were more than 30 wind turbine OEMs in the world. In general terms,wind turbine OEMs can be categorized in three groups:
 International players with global reach, e.g., SGRE, Vestas (Denmark), GE Renewable Energy
(France/United States) and Nordex (Germany)
 Chinese OEMs, e.g., Goldwind (Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) and Envision
 Other regional OEMs (mostly located in India), e.g., Suzlon Energy Ltd. and Inox Wind Ltd.
(both, India)
The wind energy market in China is mainly served by local Chinese OEMs. The total market share
of non-Chinese OEMs in the Chinese market (New Unit installation) has been quite low in the lastyears, for example around 3% in 2019 (in terms of new capacity installed), according to a WoodMackenzie database for “Historical Global Wind Turbine OEM Market Share” (April 2020).However, Chinese OEMs also have a small market share in overseas markets: their share withinthe total New Unit market segment excluding China was approximately 2% in 2019, according tothe same source, based on new capacity connected to the grid. Overall, and because of the sizeof the Chinese wind energy market (the Chinese onshore market accounted for approximately43% of global onshore capacity additions in 2019), five of the top-10 global wind turbine OEMsin 2019 came from China, according to the Wood Mackenzie database mentioned above andWood Mackenzie’s “Global Wind Turbine OEM 2019 Market Share”, April 29, 2020 (“ Wood
Mackenzie 2019 Market Share Report ”).
While remaining very competitive, the global wind energy market saw a clear trend of
consolidation in the past years. According to the Wood Mackenzie 2019 Market Share Report,the top-5 players accounted together for approximately 68% of total global wind energy newcapacity (onshore and offshore) installed in 2019. This aggregate share was 20 percentagepoints higher than in 2015 (source: MAKE (now Wood Mackenzie), “Global Wind Turbine OEM2015 Market Share”, March 31, 2016). One of the drivers behind this consolidation are M&Aactivities like the merger between Siemens Wind Power and Gamesa in 2017 or the mergerbetween Acciona Windpower and Nordex in 2016. Excluding China, the top three playersaccounted together for approximately 83% of total global wind energy new capacity (onshoreand offshore) installed in 2019 (source: Wood Mackenzie 2019 Market Share Report).
268
The following chart shows the market shares of wind turbine OEMs in 2019 in terms of annual
onshore and offshore installations, both globally (left chart) and outside of China (right chart),according to data published in the Wood Mackenzie 2019 Market Share Report:

Note: “Others” includes MHI-Vestas (the 50-50 joint venture between Vestas and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries), which had
approximately 1 GW of new capacity for offshore wind projects in 2019. According to Wood Mackenzie’s methodology,MHI-Vestas’ installed capacity is not attributed to Vestas for purposes of market share calculations, but rather Vestas andMHI-Vestas are considered separately.
The major competitive factors in the wind power OEM business are scale, global reach, cost
competitiveness, technology leadership and service capabilities. SGRE and Vestas are the twoleading players with the largest installed fleets in the industry, surpassing 100 GW each already(source: Wood Mackenzie, “Global Wind Power Project Installation Database”, March 2020). Alarge installed fleet also provides a solid foundation for the service business. Major windindustrial players have set a clear focus on the introduction of more powerful turbines andcontinued cost-out along the whole value chain in order to lower LCoE.
In recent years, many of the major OEMs have started to offer hybrid solutions, where storage
and/or PV are integrated into wind power plants. This reflects the continuous adjustment ofstrategy and technology development to market trends.
11.5.4.1 Competitive Environment in the Onshore New Unit Market Segment
According to the Wood Mackenzie 2019 Market Share Report, the top-5 global onshore market
players in 2019 in terms of new capacity installations were, in this order: Vestas(20%), GE Renewable Energy (15%), Goldwind (13%), SGRE (12%) and Envision (9%), whichtogether accounted for approximately 69% of total onshore additions in 2019. ExcludingChina, SGRE is ranked third in 2019, with a market share of approximately 20%, after Vestas(34%) and GE Renewable Energy (25%) (source: Wood Mackenzie database for “Historical GlobalWind Turbine OEM Market Share”, April 2020). Competition in the onshore New Unit marketsegment has been strong in recent years, with the average sales price for new wind turbinegenerators declining at a CAGR of almost 7% over the 2015-2019 period, according to BNEF’s “4Q2019 Global Wind Market Outlook”. In the past few years, the industry has experiencedsignificant cost pressure across the whole value chain. Some players with regionally limitedmarket access have faced significant challenges to keep up with the competition. According tothe REN21 2019 Report, severe competition led to seven small turbine equipment manufacturersexiting the market in 2018. In 2019, German-based Senvion Holding GmbH (“ Senvion GmbH ”),
which was part of the top-10 wind turbine OEMs in 2017, filed for insolvency (selected assets ofSenvion GmbH and Senvion Indústria, S.A. (together “ Senvion ”) in Europe were acquired by
SGRE in 2020 (the “ Senvion Acquisition ”; see “ 12.9.3 Acquisition of Selected European Assets of
Senvion ” for more details)) and Suzlon defaulted on debt payments. However, major
international OEMs have reported a slowdown in downward pricing during the recent quarters(as mentioned, for example, with reference to the three major OEMs SGRE, Vestas and GE, in thearticle entitled “With prices stabilizing, turbine makers feel tailwinds rising”, published by S&PGlobal Market Intelligence in May 2019).
269
In order to further reduce the LCoE of onshore wind projects, all major players have been
launching higher-rated wind turbine generator models moving past 5 MW and increasingrotor diameters beyond 150 meters. Almost all major onshore players except for Enercon andGoldwind work with geared power train setups. OEMs are striving for higher economies ofscale through better modularization and larger business volumes.
11.5.4.2 Competitive Environment in the Offshore New Unit Market Segment
The offshore wind turbine business is characterized by significant entry barriers due to the high
investment required, both for technology development and for the manufacturing footprint,high reliability requirements posed on offshore turbines as well as increased O&M requirementsdue to the significant effort needed to conduct on-site maintenance or repair activities.
According to the Wood Mackenzie 2019 Market Share Report, the top-5 offshore market
players worldwide in 2019 in terms of new installations were, in this order: SGRE (39%),MHI-Vestas (15%), Shanghai Electric (SE Wind) (11%), Envision (11%) and Goldwind (9%), whichtogether accounted for approximately 85% of total offshore capacity additions in 2019. For themarkets outside China, SGRE and MHI-Vestas accounted for a market share of 65% and 25%,respectively, in terms of 2019 new offshore installations (source: Wood Mackenzie database for“Historical Global Wind Turbine OEM Market Share” (April 2020)). Despite limited historic marketshare, GE announced in 2018 an investment program of more than USD 400 million in thedevelopment and deployment of a new offshore turbine (“Haliade-X”).
As a market leader with nearly 30 years of experience in offshore (SGRE was an offshore pioneer
– having provided turbines for the world’s first offshore wind power plant in Vindeby, off thecoast of Denmark, in 1991), SGRE had installed more than 50% of the total global offshore fleetby the end of 2019 (cumulative installed capacity figures according to Wood Mackenzie’sdatabase on “Historical Global Wind Turbine OEM Market Share”, which includes new capacityadditions for (i) the period before 2009 and (ii) each of the years from 2009 until 2019). In 2019,GE installed a prototype of its “Haliade-X” 12 MW-220 offshore wind turbine and receivedpreferred supplier status for offshore projects totaling almost 5 GW. So far, Chinese playershave offshore installations only in China, with Shanghai Electric being the clear leader in thelocal market, having a share of more than 40% of total offshore cumulative installed capacity inChina as of the end of 2019. SGRE has licensing agreements with Shanghai Electric for theoffshore wind power projects in mainland China’s territorial waters that cover SGRE’s 4.0 MW,6.0 MW, 7.0 MW and 8.0 MW offshore wind turbine technology. In May 2020, SGRE publiclyannounced its new offshore wind turbine, released with a nameplate capacity of 14 MW, butwhich can reach 15 MW with a “power boost” option. The new 14 MW offshore wind turbine isintended to be used at the upcoming 300 MW Hai Long 2 project in Taiwan, subject to a finaldecision of the consortium partners, and a deployment of the turbine for the rest of the 1,044MW Hai Long pipeline is also being considered.
For the offshore New Unit market segment, SGRE and GE rely on the direct-drive technology,
while MHI-Vestas relies on mid-speed geared drive technology with a permanent magnetgenerator. In general, it is to be expected that the trend towards increasing nameplate capacityas well as blade size will continue also in the upcoming years. This also results in increasingchallenges relating to the manufacturing and logistics for offshore turbines. SGRE sees itself wellprepared to meet such challenges due to its extensive experience and its continuous innovationinitiatives along the value chain.
11.5.4.3 Competitive Environment in the Service Market Segment
As mentioned under “ 11.5.3.3 Service Market Segment ”, the Service (O&M) market segment of
the wind energy market is mainly served by OEMs. However, players also include an increasingshare of customers that insource O&M activities; these are mainly large utilities with a significantinstalled fleet size.
270
The foundation for an OEM’s service business is its own installed fleet. SGRE and Vestas have by
far the largest installed fleet in the industry, with more than 100 GW each already. Significantbenefits and profitability can be achieved through scale effects.
In the rapidly changing market environment of the wind industry, the wind turbine fleets of
many wind power plant asset owners show an increasing diversity of technologies and brands. Asowners expand their fleet sizes, most expand their fleets beyond a single turbine manufacturer,either due to economic or performance-related considerations, or through the integration offleets resulting from M&A activities.
For the past few years, in particular ISPs and some OEMs have placed increasing effort in
so-called “multi-brand services”, where turbines from other OEMs are serviced. For example,Vestas has completed two major acquisitions of ISPs in the past years (UpWind Solutions andAvailon), which have supported the growth of its multi-brand service businesses. By the end of2019, Vestas’ multi-brand O&M fleet size was 7.4 GW (source: Vestas’ brochure entitled “VestasMultibrand Services”, 2020, available from Vestas’ website). In January 2020, SGRE completed theacquisition of Senvion’s European service assets and IP (excluding IP rights in India), which addedaround 8.9 GW of serviced fleet and operations in 13 countries, taking SGRE’s multi-brandfootprint to more than 10 GW.
Furthermore, in the last years significant efforts have been put by the leading service OEM
players in digitalization technology, with a focus on diagnostics and preventive service strategy.SGRE sees itself well-positioned also in this area, with continuous investment in innovation,according to its own assessment.

12.2 Investment Highlights
Our purpose and mission is to energize society, while supporting the transition towards a moresustainable energy world with our innovative technologies and our ability to turn ideas intoreality.
12.2.1 Leader in the Energy IndustrySiemens Energy comprises the former energy infrastructure businesses of Siemens AG operating
in two segments: Gas and Power and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE). The origins ofGas and Power date back more than 150 years and we estimate that roughly 1/6 (one sixth) ofthe world’s electricity generation is based on our technologies. Siemens Gamesa RenewableEnergy is a leader in wind power generation equipment with a history which began almost 40years ago. SGRE is a pioneer in offshore wind technology and more than 50% of the existingglobal offshore wind fleet by the end of 2019 had been supplied by SGRE (source: WoodMackenzie, “Historical Global Wind Turbine OEM Market Share” database with cumulativeinstalled capacity figures, April 2020).
We view Siemens Energy as one of the largest suppliers of technology in the energy and
electricity sector with an integrated offering that addresses a large part of the energy market.We believe that we provide a leading portfolio along almost the entire energy value chain inboth conventional and renewable energy generation, energy transmission, oil and gas and otherprocess industries. Siemens Energy’s 91 thousand employees (as of June 30, 2020) in more than 90countries are supporting its customers around the globe with system critical energyinfrastructure. Given our leading market positions, high market entry barriers, the breadth of ourportfolio as well as our customer focus, we believe that we are well positioned to benefit fromthe dynamic changes in our markets. Because we are usually in a number one or two position in
273
our relevant markets globally, we consider Siemens Energy to be a leading global energy
infrastructure company. The breadth of our portfolio is reflected in our revenue mix. Forexample, in the fiscal year 2019, our Gas and Power segment contributed 65% of our totalrevenue of Total Segments, therein the Transmission, Generation and Industrial Applicationsdivisions total revenues with approximately 20%, 28% and 18% of our total revenue of TotalSegments, respectively. The Generation division’s central and decentral business activitiesestimated to account for approximately 24% (service: approximately 14%; new unit:approximately 10%) and approximately 4% (new unit only) of our total new unit and servicerevenue of Total Segments (including Intercompany business), respectively. Our SGRE segmentcontributed 35% of our total revenue of Total Segments.
We energize societies around the globe. We have experience in implementing electrification
roadmaps for whole countries. Recent examples include countries such as Egypt, where weinstalled three combined-cycle power plants and six substations comprising gas-insulatedswitchgear to transmit the electricity generated in Egypt’s transmission system, which feedelectricity for 40 million people to the grid and enabled our customers to gain more than€1 billion annual cost savings. In Iraq, 11 GW are being added to the grid including amongst
others a 500 MW gas-fired power plant, 13 substations and 35 power transformers, providingelectricity for 38 million people. In Bolivia more than 1 GW was added to the grid by 23 SGT-800,11 industrial steam turbines and 25 transformers providing 11 million people with electricity. InBolivia, we have also established a service and training center.
12.2.2 Spin-Off allows for a step change in operational performance
The Spin-Off offers the opportunity for Siemens Energy to further drive and improve its own
operational performance.
We are implementing a two-phased strategy program to which we refer as “ Energy of
Tomorrow ”. During the first phase ( Accelerating Impact ), which we expect to complete until the
fiscal year 2023, we will focus and deliver on the fundamentals, co-create innovations and startthe energy transformation. The second phase ( Leading the Energy Transformation ) is designed to
make us the most-valued energy company, which electrifies countries and communities and is thebest place to work.
In our Gas and Power segment, potential measures targeted to achieve an Adjusted EBITA
Margin before Special Items in a range from 6% to 8% by fiscal year 2023 include thestreamlining of our portfolio, reshaping our footprint by increasing the share of workforce inbest-cost countries of below 25% as of today, potentially reducing our R&D centers toconcentrate our activities and build capabilities in best-cost countries while keeping a leancorporate structure. In the project business we evaluate options to improve our margins andreduce our currently high non-conformance costs. By the fiscal year 2023, we strive for areduction of our non-conformance costs by at least 30% (compared to the fiscal year 2019).Furthermore, we have defined measures in supply chain excellence, to sustainably reduce ourinventory and to get closer to our customers.
We have set a clear path to deliver global cost savings through stringent cost out programs,
which both segments have already initiated and which are on track.
As of June 30, 2020, the Gas and Power segment achieved gross cost savings of almost
€500 million, as compared to the fiscal year 2018. In addition, our programs “PG 2020” and “GP
2020+” are expected to achieve further global cost savings of at least €500 million by the end of
fiscal year 2023, as compared to the fiscal year 2018.
To achieve our targets, we are evaluating potential further restructuring and optimization
measures, in particular, for the implementation of a function optimization program within our“GP 2020+” program and the optimization of our footprint and our project execution. As part ofthe ongoing evaluation process, we are closely analyzing how such measures could be designedand what consequences they would have for Siemens Energy, our customers and our employees.While the evaluation process may further crystalize in the near future already, no resolution has
274
been made yet on future measures and these measures are subject to consultation with
employee representatives. Also, the findings of this process will be discussed in the relevantcommittees, which will subsequently take a decision.
In total, our restructuring and optimization programs and the potential further measures
outlined above aim at global cost savings of around €700 million by the fiscal year 2021 and are
expected to exceed the originally targeted global cost savings for the fiscal year 2023 of around€1 billion by at least €300 million, compared to the fiscal year 2018. On the basis of these
programs and measures, we target additional global cost savings in the low triple digit euromillion range by the fiscal year 2025.
For more information, see “ 9.4.10.1 Restructuring and Integration Measures in our Gas and
Power Segment ”.
As the majority shareholder of our SGRE segment, we believe that we are best placed to support
the unlocking of its full potential. The strong business of our SGRE segment with its 100%decarbonized portfolio is a key lever for the Group’s green policies. SGRE has a strong presence inonshore wind and is a pioneer in offshore wind technologies with more than 50% of existingoffshore installations provided by SGRE (cumulative installed capacity figures according to WoodMackenzie’s database on “Historical Global Wind Turbine OEM Market Share”, which includesnew capacity additions until the end of 2019). At the same time, its end-market is expected togrow strongly both in offshore and service and to remain large in onshore ( e.g., at a CAGR of
22% from 2019 to 2025 in offshore wind installations (source: Wood Mackenzie, “Global WindPower Market Update: Q2 2020”, June 2020)). With its new “LEAP” program, SGRE plans toturnaround onshore into sustainable profitability and to capture the growth potential thatoffshore and service offer. Our SGRE segment plans to maintain focus in productivity and assetmanagement and also in operational excellence, innovation, digitalization and sustainability andpeople.
Furthermore, we will be focusing on dedicated strategies and synergy realization designed to
untap SGRE’s full potential. We see significant synergy potential resulting from collaboration inareas such as procurement, go-to market and strategic collaborations, among others. From astrategic perspective, fields like the service business, where both companies enjoy significantoperations, or clean hydrogen, where both companies are present in complementary parts of thevalue chain offer collaboration potential that will be explored. Intensified cooperation betweenthe Gas and Power segment, Siemens AG and the SGRE segment is expected to deliver annualcost savings of up to €100 million.

12.2.3 Leading portfolio in the industry
In our view, the disruptive trends defining the energy markets are demand growth,
decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization. While posing great challenges, we believethat we have the people, experience and skills to capitalize on these trends.
Demand growth – Primary energy demand and final energy consumption are expected to grow
in the medium- to long-term, despite ongoing increases in energy efficiency. Under the IEA’sStated Policies Scenario as well as the Sustainable Development Scenario, electricity demand isexpected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 2% over the 2018-2040 period (source: WEO2019). All of our activities are directly or indirectly involved in supplying energy where andwhen it is needed. Accordingly, demand growth offers opportunities for all divisions of our Gasand Power segment and of our SGRE segment, e.g., in Asia Pacific.
Decarbonization – Global efforts to reduce the level of GHG emissions and the determination
to fight climate change have intensified over the last decades. Decarbonization is a key lever tolower the amounts of GHG emitted globally and is acting as an important driver for thetransformation of the energy sector. Under the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario and theSustainable Development Scenario, renewables are expected to account for 44% and 67%,respectively, of the global electricity generation by 2040 (source: WEO 2019). This trend hastriggered a shift towards renewables and sector coupling based on hydrogen. Although morethan 50% of our portfolio is decarbonized per fiscal year 2019, we believe that renewablesalone will not be able to cover the world’s electricity needs in the foreseeable future,translating into a growing need for highly efficient conventional power generation equipmentand the modernization of existing fossil-based generation equipment. We therefore expectincreases in wind power demand, new demands in transmission and an emerging market forelectrolyzers.
Decentralization: Renewable and conventional electricity is increasingly generated decentrally.
Distributed energy systems comprise not just decentral generation, but also local energystorage as well as demand response. While we expect centralized generation units to continueto play an important role in the foreseeable future, we expect the trend towardsdecentralization to persist. Particularly, the shift towards decentralization in gas will createopportunities for small and medium gas turbines and new solutions in our IndustrialApplications division.
Digitalization – Digital technologies and the resulting changes in consumer behavior, combined
with corresponding regulatory initiatives, are expected to change energy markets
276
fundamentally. As interconnectivity, data availability and the degree of automation continue
to increase, new business opportunities across all stages of the energy technology value chainarise. Specifically energy technology players can improve their existing offering with asset-related digital offerings and expand their portfolio with new standalone software as servicesolutions. In addition, the increasing automation of processes enabled through digitalizationpresents the fundament for productivity improvements.
As a result of these trends, there is a variety of equipment and service requirements which differ
across countries depending on the existing infrastructure, the availability of fuel, wealth andenvironmental policies. Our leading market positions across different technologies, the efficiencyand reliability of our products, our solutions expertise and the quality of our services will allow usto capitalize on these trends as the individual needs of our customers around the globe differwidely. While we anticipate the rapid shift from fossil-based fuels to renewables to continue inEuropean countries, we expect countries with access to fossil fuels not to shift directly from fossilto renewable power, but initially to transition from coal to gas to lower emissions in the existinginfrastructure. As an example, we see in Asia, Australia opportunities for revenue growth for allour businesses driven by the need for grid development, increasing industrial growth, a growingshare of wind and the shift from coal and nuclear to gas. Technology partnerships enable us toaccess certain markets more efficiently.
Supporting a transition from coal to gas ties in with our efforts to contribute to a sustainable
energy industry which also includes a commitment to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions ofour own business operations (climate neutrality) by 2030. In this context, we are reviewing thedetails of the phase-out of our coal-related business activities in the long run. As part of thisreview process, we are currently closely evaluating what consequences such phase-out wouldhave for Siemens Energy, our customers and our employees. The findings of this review will bediscussed in the relevant committees, which will subsequently take a decision. As part of thephase-out of our coal-related business activities, we would likely stop supporting theconstruction of new coal-fired power plants, while we would, of course, continue to honor anycontractual obligations that were created prior to a final decision being taken on this matter.Furthermore, we expect to continue to offer our services for existing coal-fired power plants. Wewant to use our business relationships with coal-fired power plant operators to offer, amongother things, CO
2-reducing solutions that minimize the adverse effects of coal-fired power
generation.
12.2.4 Service business as a core value driver
We are determined to transform Siemens Energy into a product-led service company with
significant contributions from services across all businesses.
Our Gas and Power segment has a large installed base of more than 90,000 service-relevant units
(as of June 30, 2020; including large, industrial gas and aero-derivative gas turbines, large andindustrial steam turbines and compressors) as well as more than 100 GW installed capacity atSGRE globally. This installed base provides the foundation of our resilient and high-marginservice business, which amounted to total revenue of €9.5 billion, representing almost one third
of Siemens Energy’s Total Segments’ revenue in the fiscal year 2019. As of September 30, 2019,we had a service Order Backlog of €35 billion in our Gas and Power segment and €12 billion in
our SGRE segment, providing us with a strong basis for future profitable revenue generation.
Our growing and highly profitable service business provides us with continuous customer touch
points and is a key profit contributor, characterized by a high level of resilience to mainmacroeconomic shocks. The main reasons for this are threefold: (i) energy infrastructure is criticaland needs to be maintained in order to provide electricity, (ii) we have a broad customer baseand (iii) our products are highly sophisticated which creates significant entry barriers to theservice business. In addition, this technical sophistication of our products and the quality of theservices we offer leads to a high conversion rate between new installations and service contracts.As an example, we estimate a conversion rate of close to 100% for high efficiency large gasturbines and estimated renewal rates of 60% for low efficiency gas turbines of our Generation
277
division (which we target to increase to 70% by the end of 2020) in our Gas and Power segment
based on new unit projects sold together with service agreements. In our SGRE segment, weestimate a capture rate of approximately 60% based on our serviced own installed fleetcompared to total installations. We estimate a high contract retention rate of approximately80% and an average duration of approximately 12 years for long-term service programs in ourGas and Power segment and approximately 9 years on average in our SGRE segment (in each caseas of June 30, 2020).
The long life-time of our products coupled with the high level of wear and tear during
operations and increased fleet utilization in most regions lead to a particularly large share ofservice revenue as a percentage of total revenue. Especially the long-term service contractsgenerate a continuous revenue flow due to regular service inspections. Due to the rapid growthin its installed base, we see strong growth potential for the service business of our SGRE segment.
The services we offer are maintenance, spare parts, modernizations and upgrades and
increasingly digital services. In maintenance, it is critical for our customers to keep installationsoperating at the designated performance level with little or no unscheduled downtime.21 thousand highly skilled employees (as of June 30, 2020) active in 73 service centers in theworld and sophisticated spare part logistics help us to support our customers running theirmachinery at maximum uptime and as efficient as possible. Our leading-edge product portfoliodoes not just help us to grow the installed base, but also feeds our modernization and upgradeactivities, which are on average due after 20 years where we can often achieve significantefficiency improvements (cost reductions) for the customer. Digital services and innovation allowfor an optimization of our customers’ fleets, remote monitoring and predictive maintenanceoften enhancing availability and capacity of our customers’ installations and offer additionalrevenue growth opportunities from our installed base. We are also de-emphasizing solutions andwithin solutions shifting from low-margin EPC contracts to more complex, higher-marginprojects.
12.2.5 Developing future portfolio with focus on sustainability and service
Research and development expenses of €1,001 million in the fiscal year 2019 stands testimony to
our R&D efforts, which we believe are fundamental to our success. We steer the R&D activities ofour 5 thousand R&D employees (as of June 30, 2020) active in 15 R&D centers along a clearlydefined strategy. While we intend to keep our R&D spending roughly stable, we anticipate a shiftin R&D spending between divisions and the type of projects we spend our R&D on. Goingforward, we will develop the portfolio with clear focus on sustainability, service and new growthfields. While we will explore the details of our exit from coal and actively develop our portfolioto remove underperforming product lines, a focus lies on enhancements. Another focus lies onproducts with a large service potential and enhanced competitiveness of current products basedon strict return criteria. Furthermore, we will enhance our electrolyzer product line to growrevenues. We target to explore new portfolio elements to tap into growth fields such asDecarbonized Energy Systems, Energy storage systems and Power-to-x technologies.
Recent development highlights include a floating power plant provided to our customer in the
Dominican Republic delivering approximately 145 MW electrical power, remote control andmonitoring applications for offshore, the integrated digital solution Topsides 4.0, a 14 to 15 MWoffshore wind turbine (SG 14-222 DD) and industrial-scale electrolyzers for the production ofgreen hydrogen ( Silyzer ).
12.2.6 Increase EBITA and Cash Conversion
Siemens Energy has a clearly defined financial framework to drive shareholder value. We have
identified the improvement of Adjusted EBITA and Cash Conversion Rate as the key value driversfor Siemens Energy. For details on our profit forecasts for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 as wellas profitability and/or revenue targets for the fiscal year 2023 and the mid-term, see “ 22 Recent
Developments and Outlook ”.
278
Our financial performance has stabilized pre COVID-19 with a stable topline and growing
backlog. We strive to lift our significant upside potential in profitability and cash generationeven though challenging market environment and COVID-19 impacts are expected to lead to adecline of Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items to an expected (1)% to 1% in fiscal year2020. The Accelerating Impact phase of our Energy of Tomorrow program is expected to deliveran Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in a range from 6.5% to 8.5% by the fiscal year2023. In the mid-term, as a result of the Leading the Energy Transformation phase of our Energyof Tomorrow program, we target an Adjusted EBITA Margin after Special Items of at least 8%.
For the fiscal year 2023, we target a Cash Conversion Rate of 1 minus the CAGR of revenue,
excluding portfolio effects and currency effects, over the fiscal years 2021 to 2023. These keyperformance indicators are captured by the Siemens Energy’s incentive framework. Pursuant toour dividend policy in respect of fiscal years 2020 and following, we intend to propose a dividendin a distribution volume of 40% to 60% of the Group’s net income attributable to shareholdersof Siemens Energy AG as shown in the consolidated financial statements of the Companyprepared in accordance with IFRS of the respective prior fiscal year; and our target to maintain asolid investment grade rating (see “9.9.6.1 Financial Liabilities”).
12.3 Gas and Power Segment
Our Gas and Power segment comprises our Transmission, Generation and Industrial Applicationsdivisions. Together, these businesses cover key parts of the energy value chain and serve a broadbase of customers with products, solutions and services for the energy infrastructure markets asdescribed in our industry section (see “ 11 Industry Overview ”). The key trends demand growth,
decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization are common to all divisions within the Gasand Power segment, however, each is affected differently by these trends. To address thetransformation in our markets we are developing new products, solutions and services, inparticular hydrogen-based solutions as part of our New Energy Business. With our more than90,000 service-relevant units, as of June 30, 2020 in our installed fleet and more than 12 yearsaverage LTP contract duration we have a resilient backbone to our business with a truly globalfleet with approximately two-third installed in Europe and North America and a growing fleet inAsia. Based on our global fleet footprint increased large gas turbine utilization rates during thefiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, especially in Asia, Europe and North America resulted in highrevenue recognition. Our total service revenue of €7,931 million in the fiscal year 2019 can
largely be attributed to gas turbines including our large gas turbine, industrial gas turbine andaero-derivative gas turbine business. We seek to continue to grow our fleet and expect in termsof number of units until 2025 the highest growth from the Transmission division and ourindustrial and our smaller aero-derivative gas turbines. We anticipate a stable outlook for ourlarge gas turbines and a small decline in our steam fleet. In terms of revenue per unit we expectan overall growth, again with the highest increase coming from the Transmission division andindustrial and aero-derivative gas turbines and a stable development in large gas turbines andsteam. However, we will over time no longer actively market our larger sized aero-derivative gasturbines (for more information, see “ 12.3.3.1.2(2) Aero-Derivative Gas Turbines ”).
Operating in one segment allows all of our businesses to leverage their leading market positions,
the Siemens Energy brand, our global footprint in more than 90 countries and our industryknow-how. We have a common approach to R&D of, e.g., digital solutions or additive
manufacturing, project excellence, manufacturing and procurement. As demonstrated by ourlarge LNG-to-power projects (see “ 12.3.5 Project Development and Execution ”), the
comprehensive offerings of our Transmission, Generation and Industrial Applications divisionsenable to us provide our customers with integrated solutions. Together with our SGRE segmentwe believe our Gas and Power segment is uniquely positioned to deliver complex large projectsup to major infrastructure upgrades for entire countries and to serve the widely varying needs ofour customers around the globe.
We believe that our Gas and Power segment is well diversified based on the regional split of its
revenue by location of customer in the fiscal year 2019 between EMEA, Americas and Asia,Australia, which amounted to 49%, 33% and 18%, respectively.
279
In order to overcome structural issues in the Gas and Power segment we initiated programs (see
“9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items ”) to reshape our
footprint, foster project excellence, streamline our portfolio in each of the divisions, excel insupply chain, sustainably reduce inventories and get closer to our customers. As of June 30, 2020,we operated 104 sites with more than 50 employees each, thereof 75, 89 and 73 primarily servedas a basis for our (i) manufacturing, (ii) sales, execution, engineering (here, including sites withmore than 25 employees) and (iii) service relevant internal facilities. In R&D, we run 15 centerswith our employees spread in more than 90 locations. As of the same date, approximately 20% ofour employees were located at our ten largest sites. Reducing the complexity of our footprint isone of our priorities. Furthermore, we aim to increase the utilization levels of our factories byoptimizing our factory network and improving connectivity via digitalization.
In the past, our profitability was negatively affected by high proposal and non-conformance costs
incurred in connection with project execution and selection. Accordingly, we have made it ourpriorities to reduce non-conformance costs by 30% and to increase the share of high marginprojects ( project selectivity ) until the fiscal year 2023 in each case as compared to fiscal year 2019
levels. By overlooking approximately 2,700 projects in execution or warranty (projects with morethan€2.5 million order intake per project; as of April 30, 2020) we will foster our project
excellence and have implemented ProjectDAsh, a unified reporting system combining more than20 legacy systems to improve performance by increasing transparency. Furthermore, to improveportfolio analytics and systematic risk management we will implement new unified projectmanagement and selection system for empirical based decision making and monthly KPI tracking.A similar approach had successfully been implemented in Siemens Mobility reducing thenon-conformance costs by 55% and improving project margins by 350 bps from 2013 to 2019.
We strive to reduce material and organizational costs by an improved supplier base through e.g.
reducing the number of suppliers in some commodities by 30%, fully exploiting our sourcinglevers e.g. by increasing our global value sourcing share by up to 30% in some businesses, costvalue engineering, simplifying our procurement organization, maintaining the procurementalliance with Siemens and the digitalization of procurement.
Furthermore, we are targeting to optimize our rounded 125 days of inventory, which is
calculated based on inventories amounting to €5,294 million divided by cost of sales before
amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and goodwill impairmentsamounting to €15,403 million multiplied by 364.25 calendar days as of September 30, 2019 or
the fiscal year 2019, respectively.
In order to get closer to our customers, we target to foster our key account management,
provide differentiated offerings, expand our Asian business, increase our share of publicly fundedprojects with customer co-development, provide customized project financing (see also“12.3.5 Project Development and Execution ”) and strive for intensified outage coordination as
well as implement a clear accountability through end-to-end product responsibility.
Across the Gas and Power segment, we plan to drive our service margins by increased
productivity, field service tools and utilization, and innovation, e.g., advanced repairs and

Trends ”). In our view, these include the most advanced, leading-edge products and systems as
well as complex solutions, such as HVDC offshore grid connection. Revenue from new unitscontributed approximately 92% of the division’s total new unit and service revenue in the fiscalyear 2019 and revenue from services approximately 8%, respectively (including intercompanybusiness). Most recent innovations include digital products such as the Sensformer and Sensgear,
280
which also provide a basis for other digital services. To reduce environmentally-harmful assets in
the infrastructure, we offer products such as gas-insulated switchgear without SF6(one of the
most detrimental GHG) and mineral oil free transformers.
In this context we have set ourselves the following key aspirations: Remaining a market and technology leader in our Addressed Transmission Market focusing on
often mission-critical elements of the global energy system;
 Realizing excellent growth prospects driven by industry-leading and innovative portfolio
focused on key market trends digitalization, decarbonization, grid stability and electrification;and
 Significant margin improvement supported by project excellence, portfolio streamlining and
cost optimization.

12.3.1.1.1 Switchgear
A switchgear is the switching part of a substation which is used to control, protect and isolate
electrical equipment. In electricity grids, voltage levels are increased or decreased at substations,and this change in voltage levels is realized by the main transformer (for our Transmissiondivision’s transformer offering, see “ 12.3.1.1.2 Transformers ”). The various equipment parts,
including circuit breakers, disconnectors, surge arresters, current and voltage transformers as wellas earthing switches, measure and switch electric power on or off for the main transformer andpower line; all of this is collectively referred to as a switchgear. Typically, a switchgear is locatedon both the primary and secondary voltage sides of the main transformer. The main purpose of aswitchgear is to connect or disconnect power paths, i.e., power lines, power producers or
consumers. The different components of a switchgear must be duly insulated to ensure theirproper function. This insulation can be achieved by air (air-insulated switchgear) or gas(gas-insulated switchgear).
(1) Air-Insulated Switchgear
Air-insulated switchgear can be used for voltages of up to 1,200 kV and regularly require tailor-
made solutions. The installation of air-insulated switchgear is influenced by the site, existinginfrastructure and accessibility. In addition, the incoming and outgoing lines, the number andposition of transformers and the rated voltage levels for which the switching devices are builtmust also be considered. Air-insulated switchgear requires more space than gas-insulatedswitchgear. On the other hand, air-insulated switchgear is more cost-efficient than gas-insulatedswitchgear. Our Transmission division’s air-insulated switchgear comprises circuit breakers,disconnectors, earthing switches, surge arresters and insulators. Circuit breakers interrupt shortcircuit currents in case of a fault. They use the signals provided by the instrument transformers asa basis for breaking operations under fault conditions and are fundamental to network reliabilityand security. Disconnectors and earthing switches are used to ensure that an electric circuit is
282
completely de-energized and safely earthed to allow isolation of various apparatus such as circuit
breakers and transformers for maintenance, refurbishment and replacement. Disconnectors areusually not intended for normal control of the circuit, but only for safety isolation. Surgearresters protect electrical equipment from over-voltage. During normal operation, a surgearrester is designed to avoid negative effects on the power system. A surge arrester diverts theexcess voltage to ground and is built to withstand typical surges without incurring any damage.
(2) Gas-Insulated Switchgear
(aa) Conventional (SF
6) Gas-Insulated Switchgear
Short distance between a substation and the consumer results in more economical and better-
quality power supply. Accordingly, the customers of our Transmission division often seek to buildsubstations close to urban centers where space is limited. This is where gas-insulated switchgearcan make a positive contribution. They serve the same purpose as air-insulated switchgear butrequire significantly less space. This type of switchgear provides higher economic efficiencycompared to air-insulated switchgear and high reliability, as well as low noise andelectromagnetic emissions. The different components of a switchgear are enclosed in a gas-tightmetal enclosure. Their compact design allows for use in confined spaces, whether in a basementof a high-rise building, in an industrial plant or in a mobile container. Further, gas-insulatedswitchgear offers numerous advantages, from flexible switchgear designs to a long product lifeas well as low life cycle and maintenance costs. The comprehensive range of our Transmissiondivision’s gas-insulated switchgear for rated voltages from 72.5 kV up to 550 kV providessolutions that are particularly suitable for challenging and complex indoor and outdoor switchingapplications. Its conventional gas-insulated switchgear use SF
6gas as insulation medium between
live parts of the equipment and the metal enclosure. Due to a strong global footprint, it is well-positioned in the competitive environment as a gas-insulated switchgear manufacturer.
(bb) Blue Switchgear
Since 2010, the air- and gas-insulated switchgear series were innovated with the launch of the
blue series. The blue series of switchgear features an SF
6gas-free design, which provides clear
environmental benefits. It uses a proven vacuum interrupter technology with compressedsynthetic air (clean air) as an insulating medium. Synthetic air is a non-toxic, non-flammable,stable insulation medium. We believe that this technology will comply with upcoming norms andstandards for environmentally-friendly insulation mediums. The portfolio of blue switchgear isavailable today for rated voltages up to 145 kV. In the coming years, our Transmission divisionplans to expand the portfolio to include blue switchgear for rated voltages up to 550 kV. Likeconventional switchgear, blue portfolio elements offer safe and easy handling, maintenance-freeoperation as well as high operational safety. However, blue switchgear are currently more costlyand in case of gas-insulated switchgear require more space than conventional switchgear. Basedon the environmentally-friendly blue series of switchgear, we believe that our Transmissiondivision is well positioned to meet expected future demand for these products.
12.3.1.1.2 Transformers
Whether in infrastructure, industry or households, transformers play a key role in the reliable
transmission and distribution of power. The rated power, voltage level, available space and thespecific use case are all important factors that determine a transformer’s design. TheTransmission division provides different types of transformers for varying needs – from compactdistribution transformers to large power transformers. The transformers are embedded in acomplete power system encompassing power generation, transmission and distribution networks.
(1) Power Transformers
Power transformers are a core component of power transmission systems, which are designed to
deliver power to consumers efficiently and reliably. Power transformers include generatorstep-up transformers, step-down transformers and system interconnecting transformers.
283
Generator step-up transformers are essential elements which create a link between the power
station and the transmission network. They have to be built to withstand extreme thermalloading without ageing prematurely. They are responsible for the safe and reliable transmissionof generated electricity from the power plant to the substations. Generator step-up transformerstransform the voltage from the generator voltage level up to the transmission voltage level.Step-down transformers transform the voltage down from the transmission voltage level to arequired distribution voltage level. System interconnecting transformers provide connectionsbetween different voltage systems, so that active as well as reactive power can be exchangedbetween the systems.
Our Transmission division offers all types of power transformers whether small, medium or large
transformers. All of its transformers are highly customizable to best address the specific needs ofeach customer. Small power transformers are transformers from 5 mega volt ampere (“ MVA ”) to
30 MVA with a maximum service voltage of 145 kV. They are used as network transformers indistribution networks. Medium power transformers feature a power range from 30 MVA to250 MVA and a voltage of over 72.5 kV up to 300 kV and are used as network and generatorstep-up transformers. In the power range above 250 MVA and 300 kV, generator and systeminterconnecting transformers with de-energized or on-load tap changers are categorized as largepower transformers. Even ratings of more than 1,000 MVA and voltages up to 800 kV / 1,200 kVare achieved by large power transformers.
Moreover, our Transmission division offers its customers benefit from the PRETACT concept which
is aimed at ensuring the continuous operation of their critical transformers, thereby contributingto increased grid resilience. Events such as the big blackout in Canada in 1989 and the 2012blackout in Manhattan due to Hurricane Sandy have exposed the crucial role of transformers ingrid resiliency. PRETACT is a mix of products and services based on the three pillars: “Prevent”,“Protect” and “React”. This means that malfunctions of transformers due to aging or networkfailures should be prevented by monitoring, maintenance, repair and retrofit services. Further,the Transmission division has developed several designs to protect transformers against naturaldisasters ( e.g., sun storms and the resulting geomagnetically induced current, earthquakes, etc.)
and other forced outages ( e.g., assaults with firearms). If all preventive and protective measures
fail, the Transmission division reacts by swiftly deploying emergency countermeasures, which mayinclude temporarily replacing a part of or an entire substation using its mobile transformers withplug-and-play connections or its portable power solutions (see “ 12.3.1.2.2 Mobile Transmission
Solutions (“e-houses”) ”) to insure power supply with minimum outage costs and outage times.
We also hold a 20% (as of June 30, 2020) stake in Maschinenfabrik Reinhausen GmbH whose core
business is the regulation of power transformers. The investment is accounted for using theequity method. The consent of the shareholders’ meeting required for the legal transfer was notyet granted and so, for the time being, Siemens will hold this shareholding on behalf and for theaccount of Siemens Energy.
(2) Distribution Transformers
In traditional networks, distribution transformers are used to transform the distributed high or
medium voltage to low voltage levels that can be used in industries, infrastructure andhouseholds. Distribution transformers are used at the last step in the conversion chain that bringselectricity to consumers. They are also used at the first transformation step to feed powergenerated at lower voltage level by renewable sources like wind power generation into theelectricity grid. The portfolio of distribution transformers ranges from fluid-immerseddistribution transformers (FITformer series) over voltage regulators to cast-resin-insulated / drytype transformers (GEAFOL series). These products can be customized in detail to meet individualcustomer requirements.
In the wake of an enhanced electrification and decarbonization of industries, distribution
transformers play an increasingly important role to support the sustainable system integration ofproducing industries, datacenters, e-mobility and distributed renewable generation.
284
(3) Other Transformers
In addition to its main transformer portfolio range, our Transmission division also provides a
wide range of special transformers for different applications, some of which gain specialimportance with the need to increase integration of intermittent renewable power into thepower grid.
(aa) HVDC Transformers
HVDC transformers are key components of DC transmission networks that enable the
transmission of large energy amounts with high efficiency ( i.e., minimal losses) over long
distances. With the increase of renewable energy generation and rising energy prices,interconnection and power exchange between large transmission grids is becoming increasinglymore common. HVDC transformers establish back-to-back links for connecting two AC networkswith deviating frequencies. These types of transformers are key coupling elements between ACgrids and high-power rectifiers. They adapt the voltage, insulate the rectifier from the AC gridand generate a phase shift for DC power transmission at high, extra-high- and ultra-high-voltage.Converting AC into DC using HVDC transformers and power electronics can facilitate an increasein the power transfer volumes through existing rights of way, typically cutting line losses by 30 to50%. HVDC converter transformers are most efficient for overhead transmission lines above 1,000MW and 600 km.
Within its HVDC transformer portfolio, our Transmission division offers HVDC Classic, HVDC PLUS
and UHVDC ( i.e., ultra high-voltage direct current) transformers.
(bb) Products for Grid Stabilization
Phase-shifting transformers are devices for controlling the power flow through specific lines in a
complex power transmission network. They ensure grid stability and reliability by activelybalancing fluctuating power flows. This makes these transformers an essential equipment for theoperation of the grid, in particular due to the increasing infeed of volatile renewable energy. Thebasic function of a phase-shifting transformer is to change the effective phase displacementbetween the input voltage and the output voltage of a transmission line, thus controlling theamount of active power that can flow in the line. It improves the stability and flexibility of gridsby enforcing or blocking the loads or by creating balance of load sharing between twotransmission lines.
Reactors can be used to limit over voltage and compensate reactive power (shunt reactors) or
change current flow and limit short circuit currents (series reactors) with an increasing number ofhigh, extra-high and ultra-high voltage overhead lines with long transmission.
(cc) Special Transformers for Industrial and Railway Applications
Transformers are also used in a variety of industrial applications, including steel manufacturing,
electrolysis, mining as well as offshore oil and gas platforms. These industries require specifichigh current application transformers due to the high usage of power (current) as a majorresource for production.
Railway applications need special transformers to transform available power voltage to the
overhead contact line voltage, which ranges mainly from 15 kV to 25 kV, to voltages suitable fortraction converters between 0.7 kV and 1.5 kV in the train. Transformers must ensure continuousoperation under heavy overload and withstand frequent short circuits to assure uninterruptedtrain operations.
12.3.1.1.3 Sensformer and Sensgear
Digitalized transmission and distribution products are a key enabler to manage decentralization
and drive decarbonization for sustainable energy systems. Connectivity of assets is the first steptowards digitalization. Our Transmission division equips all of its new transformers (since 2018)and switchgear with sensors and a digital interface enabling easy remote real-time monitoring of
285
key parameters. These features are referred to as “Sensformer” and “Sensgear”, respectively.
They aim to increase productivity, reduce unplanned downtime and improve performance.Sensformer and Sensgear use a smart and robust Internet of Things (IoT) gateway which securelytransmits a minimum amount of required information to a cloud-based storage and visualizationplatform. In “Sensformer Advanced” our Transmission division’s visualization software allows itscustomers to monitor a digital twin of the reporting equipment in real time with a variety offeatures (Internet of Energy). Each Sensformer and Sensgear has a unique ID, which is also usedfor encryption to provide a high level of cybersecurity. So far, we have seen strong growth ratesfor our SensProducts and their digital twins.
12.3.1.1.4 Bushings, Instrument Transformers and Coil Products
The Transmission division’s core high-, medium- and low-voltage components include a range of
bushings, instrument transformers and coil products. Generally, all these components are highlycustomizable to best meet customer needs.
Bushings are electrical components that insulate a high-voltage conductor carrying current
passing through a metal enclosure or building. They are used for both AC and DC applications.Our Transmission division offers several types of bushings ranging from 24 kV to 1.200 kV voltagelevels.
Electrical instrument transformers such as current transformers, voltage transformers, power
voltage transformers, transform electrical signal from high level of current or voltage tostandardized low and easily measurable level providing visualization to substation control rooms.They are used for metering and protection purposes.
Conventional current and voltage transformers use mineral oil or SF
6gas as insulation medium
between live parts of the equipment and the metal enclosure. However, as part of its innovativeblue series, our Transmission division also offers SF
6gas-free current and voltage transformers.
In addition, modern non-conventional instrument transformers support digitalization of
substations and therefore help reducing wiring efforts and also improving the overall substationfootprint.
Coil products are used, among others, to minimize capacitive power transmission losses, to limit
power surges and to filter out oscillations.
12.3.1.2 Transmission Solutions
Transmission solutions include substations in which switchgear, transformers and high-voltage
components are installed and operated. Our Transmission division also offers modern solutionsfor managing complexity in the electricity grid through its FACTS and DC interconnectors as wellas grid access solutions for connecting distributed generation sources to the electricity grid.
12.3.1.2.1 Turnkey Substations
Around the globe, on either a turnkey basis or as a general contractor, our Transmission division
plans and construct high-, extra-high- and ultra-high-voltage substations comprising switchgear,other electrical equipment and transformers as well as all ancillary equipment such as controlsystems, protective equipment, etc. The services offered range from system planning tocommissioning and after-sales service, including training of customer personnel. All theseinstallations have in common their high standard of engineering which covers all system aspectssuch as power systems, steel structures, civil engineering, fire precautions, environmentalprotection and control systems.
12.3.1.2.2 Mobile Transmission Solutions (“e-houses”)
Our Transmission division provides a range of prefabricated substations that are equally suited
for either temporary or permanent use in challenging grid expansion and maintenanceprograms. Our Transmission division’s mobile transmission solutions consist of self-contained“plug and play” switching stations built as a fully mobile substation on a trailer, a skid, or inside
286
a shelter as an “e-house”. The modules contain all components for a complete substation,
including the power transformer, the gas-insulated switchgear, medium-, high- and extra-high-voltage cables, protection, monitoring and control systems as well as auxiliary AC and DC powersupplies. The high mobility of a mobile transmission solution enables grid operators to restorepower after a substation failure within short time. It also helps to avoid disruptions during gridmaintenance and upgrade works. Mobile transmission solutions enable faster and more reliablegrid connection for power-critical infrastructures such as electrical generation or processindustries, and they ensure little exposure to site work contingencies. As a true “plug and play”solution, the mobile transmission solution requires little civil work, as it comes entirelypre-assembled and factory-tested. This reduces site works to an absolute minimum.
12.3.1.2.3 Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS)
The important shift of the energy mix towards an increasing share of renewables challenges grid
operators with respect to enabling a safe and reliable transmission grid operation. In order tohandle the resulting unpredictable load situations, our Transmission division has developedvarious solutions to ensure network stability. These solutions focus on managing reactive power,frequency and power flow. These solutions are referred to as flexible alternating currenttransmission systems (FACTS) and are continuously enhanced in line with customer requirements.For example, our Transmission division recently developed a FACTS system permitting systemoperators to store and release energy into the electricity grid to stabilize frequency. With thesesolutions installed in the system, unacceptably high voltage fluctuations and power failures canbe prevented, network assets can be efficiently utilized, and load-induced disturbances can bemitigated.
In addition, our Transmission division provides tailor-made synchronous condenser solutions
based on a FACTS network control and on its generator and transformer expertise and portfolio.With this offering, our Transmission division supports TSOs in reducing redispatch costs, i.e., costs
incurred by TSOs in connection with the balancing of power supply and demand in electricitygrids. Its synchronous condensers consist of a synchronous generator, sourced from the productportfolio of our Generation division, and a step-up transformer integrated and combined withintelligent grid control from transmission solutions. Synchronous condensers can provide steady-state and dynamic voltage control as well as reactive power control of dynamic loads.
12.3.1.2.4 High-Voltage DC (HVDC) Transmission Systems
Our Transmission division provides a comprehensive portfolio of efficient and sustainable
solutions in a broad variety of fields of HVDC application. HVDC technology is particularly wellsuited to support and improve the sustainability, efficiency and reliability of power supplysystems. HVDC transmission systems supplement the existing AC infrastructure in a number ofways, including through highly efficient long-distance power transmission, transnational gridconnections as well as through the connection of asynchronous grids and grids with differentfrequencies.
Over the last years, demand for large-scale power exchange over long distances and often across
national borders has increased steadily. To support this energy exchange, interconnectors have tobe built bridging long distances, e.g., to cross seas. The energy transition towards renewable
energies has resulted in an increase in distances between power generation ( e.g., in offshore
wind power plants) and electricity consumers. Transporting energy using AC systems is inefficientover long distances. Thus, the more efficient HVDC transmission solutions are becomingincreasingly important to connect large-scale renewable generation and load centers. OurTransmission division’s HVDC technology has been successfully installed in more than 50 projectsworldwide. Our Transmission division believes it is the best available solution for long-distancetransmission, grid access, and grid stability. Today, its HVDC portfolio comprises two models:HVDC Classic transmission systems with line-commuted converters, and HVDC PLUS transmissionsystems with voltage-sourced converter.
Siemens Energy also provides the technology to use existing AC corridors for HVDC transmission.
287
12.3.1.2.5 Medium-Voltage DC (MVDC) Transmission Systems
Our Transmission division’s medium-voltage DC (“ MVDC ”) transmission systems addresses the
challenges that regional high-voltage transmission networks and medium-voltage distributiongrids increasingly must deal with. The MVDC portfolio aims to apply the advantages of DCtechnology available for applications in traditionally AC networks.
MVDC PLUS is an innovative universal solution designed to help handle issues such as unstable
grids, remote area connections, increased power infeed and increased autonomy from powertransmission. Compact and cost-efficient MVDC PLUS connections via cable or compact overheadlines enable cost-efficient power transmission over distances. We believe that these systems areideal for the grid connection of islands, offshore platforms and remote locations as well as theinterconnection of autonomous smart grids.
MVDC PLUS is based on modular multilevel voltage-sourced converter technology. This mature
technology has proven its efficiency and performance in numerous HVDC PLUS and SVC PLUSapplications since its first operation in 2010.
12.3.1.2.6 Grid Access Solutions
Grid access solutions are custom-engineered solutions for distributed generating units and
remote loads. They are an essential part of so-called “intelligent grid solutions”. Grid accesssolutions involve reconciling contrasting parameters, such as high reliability, low investment costsand efficient transmission in the best possible way. For example, in the design of high-, extra-high and ultra-high-voltage offshore platforms for offshore wind power plant connections to thegrid, grid access solutions optimize the entire system with particularly well suited 66 kV andabove voltage equipment to balance life cycle costs as well as performance and electrical losses,meeting local grid code requirements. By offering a turnkey solution, our Transmission divisionprovides a comprehensive approach for complex projects involving project management, designand engineering services, subcontracting, procurement and expediting of equipment, inspectionof equipment prior to delivery, shipment, transportation, control of schedule and quality,pre-commissioning and completion, performance guarantee testing, and training of owner’soperating and/or maintenance personnel. Our Transmission division believes that it is uniquelypositioned with its broad in-house engineering competence, from the initial system studies workthrough to primary and secondary engineering, including platform design/managementcompetence.
We believe, that we are a technology leader in the area of grid access solutions. For example, the
World Economic Forum recognized our Modular Multilevel Converter technology as atechnological breakthrough for connecting large offshore wind parks to the grid (source: WorldEconomic Forum, white paper entitled “Global Innovations from the Energy Sector 2010-2020”,May 2020). Furthermore, our innovative AC offshore grid connection solutions rely on offshoretransformer modules, which can reduce the size and weight of offshore platforms byapproximately 30% compared to conventional AC substations whilst providing the same or evenhigher power ranges.
12.3.1.3 Transmission Services
Our Transmission division provides a full-scope service offering through a global network of OEM
experts covering the entire life cycle of transmission products, systems, solutions, and for theelectrical balance of plants, all with the aim of increasing the reliability and availability oftransmission grids.

highly critical link. Although such electrical equipment typically has a high level of reliability, anunplanned event, due to either internal or external factors, can never be excluded. In case of asudden failure, our Transmission division offers prompt support to its customers with emergencyservices offerings, including on-site or off-site repair services depending on the scope andavailability of resources in the affected location.
12.3.1.3.4 Modernization and Retrofit Services
Electrical equipment within a power network is subject to natural ageing processes during the
network’s operation, including electrical and mechanical ageing. Typically, such equipment hasan operational life of several decades, whereby technology also typically evolves over theequipment’s lifetime. Once the equipment reaches the end of its operational life, it needs to beeither replaced or upgraded. Our Transmission division provides complete retrofitting andmodernization solutions, including refurbishment, upgrade and extension alternatives.

Our Generation division provides heatrecovery solutions for example to traditional CCPPs or the oil and gas industry, but also fordistrict heating facilities and other applications where heat transfer is required, onshore as wellas offshore. We support the energy transition with new products in the field of energy storage aswell as the electrification of the offshore oil and gas industry. Our products can be offered aspart of the solutions described below as well as on a standalone basis or in combination with,e.g., a gas turbine train.
The heat transfer technology business is organized around four product lines:HRSG – HRSGs recover energy from the exhaust gas of gas turbines to generate steam. Without
an HRSG the energy in the exhaust gas would be lost. Recovering the energy from the exhaustgas increases fuel efficiency by about 40% to 50% thereby lowering emissions as well as fuelcosts per produced KWh.
Waste Heat Recovery Units – Waste Heat Recovery Units (WHRU) significantly increase overall
plant efficiency by lowering both fuel demand and emissions. WHRU can also be used torecover the energy from other heat sources such as thermal energy storage systems. Inaddition, advanced power plant cycles such as a supercritical CO
2cycle or an organic rankine
cycle require WHRUs, making it a relevant product in the energy transition.
293
Exhaust and Diverter Systems – Exhaust and Diverter Systems offer five main products that
focus on increasing plant flexibility and maintainability.
Service and Warranty – Our Generation division is an OEM with the reputation for solving
steam generator challenges, whether on its own or others’ installed base.

will be a vital component to reliable, eco-friendly energy systems. To this end, our Generationdivision offers a variety of power plant solutions which address its customers’ needs.
Large Gas Power Plant Solutions – Highly efficient and flexible gas power plants are required
for reliable, affordable, dispatchable and sustainable energy systems. Our Generation divisionoffers both SCPPs and CCPPs using the key equipment as well as I&C and electrical from a singlesource and in different scopes. SCPPs typically offer a more robust solution covering peak loadsunder challenging conditions. In CCPPs, a HRSG transforms thermal energy of the gas turbineexhaust gases to a water/steam cycle to produce additional electricity in a steam turbine
294
generator. CCPPs recover waste heat from the electricity-generating gas turbine generator
train through a HRSG to drive a steam turbine for generation of additional electricity. CCPPsreach higher efficiencies and cover base and part loads at optimized costs. To optimize, amongother features, flexibility and efficiency of our large gas power plant solutions and therebyimprove their ability to adapt to changing market conditions, our Generation division offerscustomized solutions. To this end it has developed a wide range of specific plant technologiesaddressing the major challenges that the energy market transformation is increasingly posingon customers and plant operators ( e.g., plant flexibility features, high efficiency plant features,
emissions control). In addition, our Generation division’s modular solutions concept also allowsus to reduce construction time and costs, increase project planning security and ensure best inclass EHS performance.
Industrial Gas Power Plant Solutions – For many of our Generation division’s industrial
customers, electricity and heating are a major cost factor for the operation of their industrialplants. Exhaust, process, heating or waste steam as byproducts of industrial plant operationscan be used for producing electricity independently. Our Generation division’s customers canrealize long-term cost benefits and a reliable energy supply with its industrial gas power plantsolutions. As in the case of large gas power plant solutions, its offering ranges from powertrains over power islands to turnkey power plants and are available as SCPPs and CCPPs.Industrial gas power plant solutions are tailor-made to fit our customers’ needs in differentindustries such as steel and cement production, pulp and paper (fiber industry), mining,chemical industry and utilities (as flexible back-up for renewables).

2savings compared to
the so far installed coal-based facility.
CHP Plant Solutions – Using waste heat generated in the energy conversion process in a power
plant or industrial process can significantly increase energy efficiency and reduce overallproduct cost of the energy conversion system. In CHP plants, waste heat is utilized for otherindustrial processes, extracted to cover the heat demand of individual buildings, or exported toa district heating system. While only 30% to over 63% of the fuel used in conventional powerplants is converted to electricity, fuel efficiency levels of over 90% can be achieved in CHPplants because of heat utilization. CHP plants not only offer energy cost savings but also highsecurity of supply and help our customers in achieving their environmental goals bysignificantly reducing their carbon footprint.

In combining all decarbonization levers – efficiency increase, hybridization and deep
decarbonization – we develop future proof energy systems via co-creation, resulting in anindividualized decarbonization roadmap based on the customer’s current fleet anddecarbonization targets. The implementation steps of such roadmaps are a combination ofavailable technologies, like heat pumps or hydrogen-ready gas turbines, as well as technologiesin development. A special focus is on the integration of renewables, hybridization, and energystorage combined in customer specific optimal system designs for power generation producersand energy intensive industrial verticals. Nevertheless for the transition phase also a coal to gasshift can increase the efficiency up to 25 percentage points (source: Storm, 2017) and reduce CO
2
emissions and therefore support the customers decarbonization targets.
In our view, we have a unique position to design and implement decarbonized energy systems.

streamlining and service-led growth.
Our Industrial Applications division has set clear priority areas to achieve these objectives:Growth – In the fiscal year 2019, approximately 60% of the division’s total new unit and service
revenue was attributable to service (including intercompany service business) and was drivenby its installed base of more than 79,000 units, which we plan to further leverage to grow ourbusiness. The service business forms the Industrial Application division’s financial backbone andcontributed 70% to its Order Backlog of €10 billion as of June 30, 2020. This is the result of
long-lasting customer partnerships with oil & gas operators, such as international, national andindependent oil companies, and customers within industries such as marine, chemical, fiber,metallurgy, and air separation. We also provide services for oil & gas and distributedgeneration customers, including other industries such as food and beverages, minerals andmetals, industrial parks and municipalities, among others.
Our Orders in the fiscal year 2019 can be grouped in Orders from our upstream (approximately
30%), midstream (approximately 20%) and process industries business (includes downstreambusiness (approximately 15%) as well as Orders from industrial customers (approximately35%)), addressing both the new units business and our service relevant rotating equipmentinstalled base of approximately 7,000 units in the upstream as well as midstream business,approximately 25,000 in the downstream business and approximately 40,000 in the industriesbusiness. Based on our average Orders over the fiscal years 2017 to 2019, we received Ordersfrom more than 5,000 customers and thereof more than 20% from fifteen customers. Theorders in the fiscal year 2019 were geographically well balanced and recorded in the regions ofEurope and Africa (36.4%), Middle East (9.7%), Asia, Australia (16.6%) and the Americas(37.3%).
Major installations of often mission-critical equipment are with our customers from the oil and

530 units), BASF (approximately 280 units), Braskem (approximately 210 units) or Ineos(approximately 320 units) based on our aero-derivative and industrial gas turbines, generators,compressors & industrial steam turbines portfolio.
Moreover, we will drive our growth based on the growing share of industries, cross selling and
synergies across fully-integrated businesses with our joint regional structure and commonstrategy and our shared technology. We will leverage our R&D investments, which accountedfor 3.6% of overall revenue in the fiscal year 2019, to monetize our innovation and help ourcustomers to decarbonize and digitalize their portfolio.
Profitability and Cash – We believe we can untap our profitability and cash potential by
streamlining our portfolio, such as by selective phase-outs or consolidating compressorplatforms, increased standardization and digitalization, eliminating overcapacities and byreducing complexity. For example, in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2020, we re-assessedour portfolio of aero-derivative gas turbines and made a strategic portfolio decision tostreamline our offering with a view to increase profitability. Furthermore, since the Rolls-RoyceEnergy and Dresser-Rand acquisition we have been consolidating our footprint to reduceovercapacity and complexity and have closed more than 20 sites since then. We expect to drivecost optimization especially targeting R&D effectiveness and SG&A efficiencies, which issupported by a growing, service-led top-line. Moreover, reduced non-conformance coststhrough project management excellence as well as our world class service and supply chainexcellence are expected to benefit our profitability.

12.3.3.4.3 Performance Enhancements and Replacements
Performance enhancements and replacements include all kinds of modernizations and upgrades
(e.g., retrofits, revamps, controls upgrades) for installed equipment as well as lifetime
replacements of old units (also called brownfield exchange services (BEX)). Through the upgradeto and the use of the latest technology, performance enhancements and replacements play amajor role in reducing emissions.
310
Performance enhancements cover engineered solutions changing the technology or design of a
component or assembly, enhancing the equipment’s performance regarding efficiency, output orreliability. As an additional benefit, such enhancements usually also extend the lifetime ofequipment. A gas turbine exchange can deliver additional power output (compared to thepreviously installed turbine) and supports a lower carbon footprint for the power plant. Forexample, for our customer BASF, we materially support a CO
2reduction of 17 percentage points
for one of its power plants compared to the average of German grid power plants by exchangingone of the installed gas turbines targeting a 10% increased electrical output.
BEX for our own installed fleet or competitor equipment covers the replacement of components
or assemblies with our own components, thereby helping us to broaden our serviced fleet. Itincludes the complete exchange, revamp, retrofit or upgrade of existing components withminimum interference in the customer’s current setup.

We believe that hydrogen isat the core of an entirely new energy business, as it is expected to foster sector coupling (see“11.1.3.2.2 Decarbonization ”). Our New Energy Business currently offers electrolyzer systems for
the production of green hydrogen, which can be used to produce, e.g., synthetic fuels and other
chemicals. These are integrated into the energy value chain, where they connect with severalproducts and services provided by our other divisions within the Gas and Power segment. Variouslighthouse projects have proven the technical feasibility and industrial scalability of ourelectrolyzer-based solutions in several multi-MW plants and large-scale commercialization isexpected in the near future. In August 2020, we signed an agreement to provide a customizedhydrogen production system for a hydrogen fueling station in Beijing. The megawatt greenhydrogen production solution features our Silyzer 200 electrolyzer system and is the first of itskind to be built by us in China. It is expected to be delivered in 2021. The project is part of abroader cooperation in green hydrogen development between Siemens Energy and SPIC (forinformation on the cooperation with SPIC in other business fields, see “ 12.3.2.1.1(4)
Collaboration with State Power Investment Corporation Limited of China ”).
Our New Energy Business is currently in the start-up phase; consequently, the customers so far
consist mainly of users of pilot plants. The future customer structure will depend on the further
311
development and penetration of this new market. In particular, the extent and implementation
of sector coupling will have an impact on future customers in other economic sectors. Given thestart-up nature of our New Energy Business, we are not expecting a positive profit contributionfrom these activities in the coming years.

Werner-von-Siemens Centre, Göteborg Energi, IDEA and Equinor, proving our experience. Webelieve additive manufacturing benefits ourselves and our customers in multiple ways
Improved design and flexibility ,e.g., reflected in approximately 1% higher percentage points
efficiency (as assessed by us for contribution of additive manufacturing components(heatshields, vanes, blades) to overall gas turbine efficiency (SGT-800)), up to 50% longerlifetime (SGT-800 heatshields from additive manufacturing versus conventional components)and more than 30% reduced GHG emission in the repair process of gas turbine burners usingadditive manufacturing versus conventional manufacturing;
Faster development ,e.g., 75% reduction of development time due to fast development and
validation circles and more frequent modernization and upgrades to improve power plantperformance and profitability;
Decreased costs bye.g., more economic production of small volumes or up to 50% faster
repairs as observed for manufacturing time of laser metal deposition vs. conventional weldingrepair; and
Lower inventory ,e.g., through above mentioned fast repairs and to the same degree to
reduced lead time reduction and consequently reduced inventory and digital inventory.
For more information see “ 12.3.11.2 Generation Division ” and “ 12.3.11.3 Industrial Applications
Division ”.

12.3.11.1 Transmission Division
R&D activities in our Transmission division focus on developing products and solutions that help
to increase the transient and dynamic stability of electrical grids, while improving the overalltransmission capacity, quality, reliability, availability and environmental compatibility. In this
319
regard, demand for innovative transmission solutions and new technologies is primarily driven by
the increasing share of renewable energies. Furthermore, our R&D activities seek to reduce ourenvironmental impact. For example, our Transmission division is continuously improving itstransformers using ester instead of mineral oil and transmission products using clean air insteadof SF
6gas, as implemented in SF6gas-free switchgear (see “ 12.3.1.1.1(2)(bb) Blue Switchgear ”). In
addition, it is developing ultra and extra high voltage alternate current and DC voltagetransmission technologies which enable a highly efficient transmission of bulk power over longdistances.
As part of our R&D efforts, our Transmission division increasingly focuses on equipping our
products and systems with digital capabilities. These digital products and systems shall becomekey instruments to improve productivity and performance and to reduce unplanned downtime.For example, it equips all of its new transformers and switchgear with sensors and a digitalinterface enabling easy remote real-time monitoring of key parameters (see“12.3.1.1.3 Sensformer and Sensgear ”). It is further developing these products to attain the next
level of digitalization by introducing machine learning and advanced intelligence for cost-effective management of complex energy networks to further improve the overall cost ofownership.
Our Transmission division is also intensifying R&D in innovative materials, advanced
manufacturing methods, plant optimization and disruptive transmission technologies forcontinuous improvement and enhancement of its existing product portfolio. Innovative serviceconcepts and service technologies are also under development to enable grid operators andowners a better utilization of existing assets along with an increased reliability and availability.
12.3.11.2 Generation Division
R&D activities in our Generation division focus on the development of new and improvement of
existing products, such as the advanced air-cooled 9000HL gas turbine product line withefficiencies over 63% in combined-cycle applications. It uses highly efficient internal coolingfeatures for blades or vanes and an advanced combustion system to increase firing temperature.Product development activities are supported by base technology programs that focus onadditive manufacturing (3D-printing). As an example, gas turbine repairs using additivemanufacturing technology increase components life cycle cost value through improved durabilityand performance and reduce CO
2emissions.
A key action field of our R&D in the Generation division relates to hydrogen co-firing capabilities
of our gas turbines. It is currently developing emission technologies for the flexible combustionof natural gas / hydrogen mixtures in the range of 0-100 volume % of hydrogen for both, newunits and as upgrades to operating units. In 2019, our Generation division successfully performeda combustion test at real gas turbine conditions with up to 100% hydrogen in the burner used inSGT-800, SGT-700 and SGT-600.
Another core area of our Generations R&D is the development for technology upgrades of the
operating fleet. With our technology upgrades our customers can not only reduce their GHGemissions but also reach high return on their investments through decreased fuel consumption,increased output and higher operational flexibility.
Our Generation division focuses not only on improving the operating fleet’s efficiency and
emissions but also on improving plant operations to enhance dispatch and service factors such asservice costs and response time reduction. It is currently developing four new major gas turbineframe upgrades which aim to improve operating efficiency and extend service intervals.

Latest development in the supply chain include decentralized additive manufacturing (3D
printing), employment of spare parts on-demands and on-site repair technologies.
Industrial Applications was an early adopter of Additive Manufacturing technology and has
successfully scaled its production from R&D to serial parts production to achieve by today morethan 1,200,000 operation hours in our turbines. Our extension of laser metal deposition to repairshas reduced the lead time by approximately 50% with further improvement potentials applyingdigitized order configurator tool.
12.3.11.4 New Energy Business
R&D activities of our New Energy Business aim to support the transition towards a decarbonized
world with electro-chemical solutions. In order to further develop our position as a technologyleader in the field of industry grade hydrogen electrolyzer systems (for more information on ourelectrolyzer systems, see “ 12.3.4 Other Operations and Shareholding in Siemens India ”), our New
Energy Business plans to expand its portfolio towards a higher power range of 100 MW andabove. In the future, power ranges of up to 1,000 MW are conceivable. Building on our hydrogenelectrolyzer systems at the core of our “power-to-x” value chain, our New Energy Business plansto expand its offering from “power-to-hydrogen” to “power-to-liquid” solutions ( e.g.,
power-to-fuels or power-to-methanol) together with partners and depending on thedevelopment of customer and market demand.
Our R&D efforts increasingly focus on digital services ranging from the (a) design and
optimization of “power-to-hydrogen” plants and “power-to-x”-solutions, (b) standardized, highefficient electrolyzer modules and plants, (c) maintenance services based on monitoring &diagnosis systems up to (d) digital twins to optimize the plant design and to improve theproductivity and lifetime of electrolyzer systems and solutions. In addition, our New EnergyBusiness aims to develop these products and services towards the integration of artificialintelligence and machine learning methods.
12.3.11.5 Organization
We organize our product-focused R&D activities in our Gas and Power segment along our
Transmission, Generation and Industrial Applications divisions, while separately developingproducts for our New Energy Business. The separate development units promote technology andproduct developments as well as system integration world-wide. A central technology andinnovation department orchestrates and aligns R&D efforts and is scouting technology trendsand innovations in order to improve existing products and bring new technologies into SiemensEnergy. Cross-business unit issues, material innovations and major decisions are coordinated byjoint development teams.
Siemens Energy follows the “open innovation” approach in R&D. This approach is characterized
by cooperation partnerships with third parties for innovative concepts, products or technological
321
solutions. Our Gas and Power segment forms such partnerships with many leading industry
companies as well as with world-renowned universities and research institutes such as GermanAerospace Center DLR (Cologne, Germany), RWTH Aachen (Aachen, Germany) and Georgia Tech(Atlanta, USA). These activities allow our Gas and Power segment to obtain information onrelevant technologies at an early stage, enabling it to develop and launch innovative products onthe market.
Other research collaborations include our involvement in AGTurbo, EUTurbines and the Research
Association for Combustion Engines ( Forschungsverbund Verbrennungskraftmaschinen ).
AGTurbo is a global network of university institutes, research centers and the world marketleaders in the turbomachinery industry with headquarters or branches in Germany. AGTurbodevelops pre-competitive R&D project ideas (especially application-oriented turbomachineryresearch in Germany), coordinate them within the research network and submit these projectproposals to the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology ( Bundesministerium für

In 2015, it received the GermanRenewables Award in the category “Product Innovation of the Year” for the Silyzer electrolysissystem for hydrogen production.
12.3.12 IP Rights
IP is an essential part of our Gas and Power segment’s business and IP assets are, in the
aggregate, of material importance. However, we believe that no single IP asset is material to itsbusiness as a whole, except for its right to use the trademark name, “SIEMENS ENERGY”. Webelieve our Gas and Power segment’s IP portfolio is a competitive advantage for the businessand, accordingly, our Gas and Power segment devotes significant resources to develop, protect,defend, and exploit its IP assets.
Our Gas and Power segment’s patent portfolio is predominantly based on employee inventions
from our R&D efforts. The IP organization has offices in Germany, the United States, Great Britainand China and each office is located in close proximity to its primary R&D sites, which are basedin Berlin, Düsseldorf, Erlangen, Munich, Orlando (US) and Beijing. As of June 30, 2020, our Gasand Power segment held about 18,400 single patents and utility models in approximately 5,200patent families, including approximately 12,600 granted patents or registered utility models,globally. In addition, it currently maintains, protects, and owns approximately 2,000 marks,including approximately 1,800 registered trademarks.
Our Gas and Power segment has defined and implemented dedicated IP strategies for each
business. Its divisions are supported by experienced IP organization of patent professionalsspecialized in energy IP matters. Key elements of its IP framework strategy include generating
322
clusters of IP rights addressing different aspects of selected unique selling point features. Our Gas
and Power segment actively manages its IP portfolio to maintain and enhance its technologicalposition and competitive advantage as well as to create business opportunities from IP.
In recent years, our Gas and Power segment has been pursuing a more selective strategy when
filing for new patents, which is aimed at reducing costs while at the same time adequatelyprotecting its innovations. As a result, the average number of new filings decreased fromapproximately 780 in the fiscal year 2017 to approximately 530 in the fiscal year 2019. Thisdecrease was mainly driven by a reduction in patent filings for inventions related to rotatingequipment which decreased from approximately 320 in the fiscal year 2017 to approximately 100in the fiscal year 2019.
Generally, our Gas and Power segment’s IP strategy is based on three pillars: protect, defend and
exploit.
Protect – It protects its IP rights by, among other things, filing new patents, utility models,
designs, trademarks, copyrights and registering domains with appropriate regional coverage.
Defend – It monitors third-party IP rights and takes appropriate countermeasures to defend
against allegations of infringing on third-party IP rights. Such countermeasures includeinvalidation actions, implementing alternative solutions, or seeking to obtain a license. In thefiscal year 2019, the Gas and Power segment filed 45 objections against third party patents. Inaddition, it entered into license agreements regarding third-party IP rights from selectedcompanies and universities, as well as from the Siemens Group to support our current andfuture businesses (see, also “ 18.1.1.1.4 Trademark and Name Use (Sub-)License Agreement with
Siemens Energy ”).
Exploit – It makes its IP visible in tenders and contracts, particularly when there is a focus on its
patents and the underlying protected technology. Furthermore, by actively licensing its patentsit tries to generate additional value for its business. For example, it generates additionalincome from the licensing of its patents.
We have applied to register our brand “SIEMENS ENERGY” in more than 100 countries
worldwide. Several hundred product names are registered as trademarks in numerous countries.Among them are several marks with a longstanding tradition in the business such as Benson,Trafo-Union, Geafol or Elin.
12.3.13 Insurance
Our Gas and Power segment’s current insurance coverage is provided under the Siemens global
insurance policies until September 30, 2021 and in amounts that we believe are consistent withcustomary industry practices in its businesses and for its business operations, including insurancefor property damage, business interruption and construction coverage, general liability insurance(including products, operations and services liability), marine and cyber insurance. Following theexpiry of its insurance coverage under the Siemens global insurance policies, our Gas and Powersegment intends to enter into new global policies substantially similar to the previous insurancepolicies, giving due consideration to the size and risk profile of its business and the volumesavailable in the insurance market at reasonable economic conditions. Accordingly, no assurancecan be given that our Gas and Power segment will be able to obtain insurance coverage that hasa comparable scope at similar costs. The directors and officers liability insurance (“ D&O
insurance” ) and other financial lines programs ( e.g., employment practices liability, crime
insurance and criminal legal defense cost insurance) will be replaced by its own policies at thelatest upon Spin-Off Completion.
12.4 SGRE Segment
Our SGRE segment is a leading global supplier of wind power solutions to customers all over theworld and had the second highest installed capacity (in GW) of wind turbines worldwide as ofthe end of 2019 (source: Wood Mackenzie 2019 Market Share Report, database of historicalcapacity installations).
323
With almost 40 years of experience in the wind power business, SGRE designs, develops,
manufactures, sells, installs and maintains both onshore and offshore wind turbines. SGRE offers,in its own assessment, one of the broadest product portfolios in the industry as well as industry-leading service solutions, helping to make clean energy more affordable and reliable.
SGRE S.A. is headquartered in Spain. Our SGRE segment generated €10.2 billion in total
revenues in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 (fiscal year 2019). Its Order Backlog stood ata strong €32 billion as of June 30, 2020.
The activities of our SGRE segment are organized in two main businesses: (i) Wind Turbines,
which consists of the business units Onshore Wind Power and Offshore Wind Power (alsoreferred to as “ Onshore ” and “ Offshore ”, respectively), and (ii) Operation and Maintenance
(Service). As of June 30, 2020, 46.9% (or €15 billion) of the Order Backlog related to the SGRE
segment’s service activities, which have higher profitability and have expanded considerably overthe past few years, driven by a higher installed base ( e.g., an increase by 9.1% in the fiscal year
2019 compared to the fiscal year 2018). In addition, in the context of energy transition trends,the SGRE segment explores opportunities in adjacent renewable business fields. The SGREsegment’s wind turbine and service portfolio creates value reducing the Levelized Cost of Energy(LCoE), contributing to long-term returns for customers and to the development of the industry.There is more than 100 GW of installed capacity of SGRE wind turbines spread across the globedelivering more than 260 Mt GHG savings per year in more than 70 countries and a fleet ofapproximately 72 GW under maintenance (including the integration of the fleet acquired in theSenvion Acquisition), in each case as of June 30, 2020.
SGRE has a leading product and service platform in place to benefit from the favorable outlook
for the wind energy market. As described in our industry section (see “ 11.5.3.2 New Unit Market
Segment – Offshore ” and “ 11.5.3.3 Service Market Segment ”), the Offshore New Unit and the
Services market segments present strong growth prospects (with expected CAGRs of 22% and 8%respectively for the period from 2019 to 2025; sources: Wood Mackenzie, “Global Wind PowerMarket Update: Q2 2020”, June 2020, and 2019 O&M Reports, including related data sets) andSGRE has a very strong competitive and profitable position in both of them. In offshore, SGRE isthe market leader (both in terms of new capacity additions in 2019 as well as of the offshoreturbine installed base, according to Wood Mackenzie data; see “ 11.5.4.2 Competitive
Environment in the Offshore New Unit Market Segment ”) with unparalleled track-record with
more than 1,000 direct drive turbines installed and an Offshore Order Backlog of €9 billion as of
June 30, 2020. The Order Backlog consists of 7.6 GW of firm orders; additionally, SGRE has 9.3GW in the pipeline from preferred offshore agreements, the highest in the industry (according toour assessment, based on competitors’ and industry-related publications). With respect to Service,SGRE has also the second largest fleet under maintenance in the industry (onshore and offshore),with a Service Order Backlog of €15 billion as of June 30, 2020.
At the same time, the Onshore New Unit market segment is expected to remain the largest wind
market segment in the coming years (see “ 11.5.3.1 New Unit Market Segment – Onshore ” for
more information). SGRE also has a leading product platform in this sector, with 89 GW installedand with an Onshore Order Backlog of €7 billion as of June 30, 2020. In general, profitability in
the onshore sector has significantly decreased in recent years due to the introduction of auctionsand tensions in the supply chain ( e.g., so-called trade wars and the recent impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, among others). Additionally, our SGRE segment has been recentlynegatively affected in its Onshore business by cost overruns in some projects and also by thestructural challenges in the Indian market, where SGRE has a leading position.
Our SGRE segment aims for value creation by improving the profitability in onshore activities
through a dedicated turn-around effort and capturing the growth potential of the offshore andservices sector while maintaining profitability. Furthermore, our SGRE segment has set a clearpriority on profit over volume, in particular in onshore, as well as strong focus on cashgeneration. With significant progress made already in recent years, our SGRE segment remainscommitted to sustainability.
324
With its new “LEAP” program, our SGRE segment has set clear priority areas:
Innovation – Strive for technology leadership and business model innovation. Within Onshore,
its recently announced 5.X platform is expected to become the mainstream product platform in2022/2023. In Offshore, the SG 11.0-200 DD wind turbine, for which several orders werereceived in 2020, is expected to reach serial production in 2022, and the recently announced SG14-222 DD wind turbine, which has also been selected for several projects (subject to certainconditions) is expected to reach serial production in 2024.
Productivity & Asset Management – Continued focus on cost out and stringent cash
management and control across our SGRE segment to optimize profitability and cashgeneration. For example, in procurement, a program has been launched aimed to achievemore than 5% productivity increase in third-party spend each fiscal year until 2023 and inmanufacturing, to adapt the internal footprint to shifts in demand and supply.
Operational Excellence – Strengthening process and project execution discipline and achieving
industry benchmark safety and quality levels. SGRE also plans to reduce risks in its operations,for example by adopting a more selective approach or reducing its direct exposure todevelopment activities in some countries, e.g., by seeking collaboration with third parties.
Furthermore, SGRE plans to strengthen project management quality controlling and toleverage on cross-business best practices.
 Sustainability and People – Becoming the ‘go to’ company in renewable energy by setting the
industry benchmark in sustainability and employer attractiveness.
In addition, our SGRE segment will invest in digitalization, which is believed to be a key enabler
for accelerating the achievement of its objectives.
In this context, SGRE’s key objectives for the period until 2023 are focused on:Returning Onshore to sustainable profitability with a turnaround plan focused on the
following priorities: (i) focus on profitable volume and de-risking of the business;
(ii) introduction of new leading technology; (iii) reduction of supply chain complexity;(iv) reinforcement of project execution capabilities; and (v) reorganization to optimizeperformance. SGRE strives to complete the operational turnaround of its Onshore business bythe end of 2022.
Capturing offshore market growth through profitable leadership position with the following
priorities: (i) maintain technological differentiation; (ii) globalization with market expansionand early customer engagement; and (iii) maintaining the focus on execution excellence.
Sustainably growing faster than the market at benchmark profitability in services with the
following priorities: (i) continuously develop new business models together with customers;(ii) focus on innovation, productivity and operational excellence; and (iii) capture potential ofthe profitable multi-brand business.
Following these outlines, SGRE’s business mix based on revenue share is expected to shift towards
a higher share of Offshore and Service and consequently less Onshore business. In addition,following the energy transition trends, SGRE is also actively exploring adjacent business areas tountap the full potential of its core wind business, such as hybrid solutions, storage, floating orhydrogen.
With the LEAP program as key enabler for value creation, we expect our SGRE segment’s topline
to grow above market by 2023 and to deliver Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in arange from 8% to 10% in the fiscal year 2023. Furthermore, our SGRE segment targets tomaintain a book-to-bill ratio above 1.0 on average during the fiscal years 2021 to 2023. As part ofits overall financial framework, SGRE will aim to maintain these levels also beyond 2023.
12.4.1 Products and Services
The core business portfolio of our SGRE segment comprises wind turbines for onshore and
offshore wind power plants as well as a wide range of services. These business lines allow SGRE
325
to be present across the wind value chain, by offering a wide range of products and services for
different project types and site conditions. Innovation is a key driver in the wind energy sector.SGRE believes it is at the forefront of technological development and innovation, and that it hasone of the most comprehensive wind turbine and service portfolios in the sector, enabling it tominimize the LCoE (for more information on LCoE, see “ 11.5.2.5 Cost Trends ”) and to provide
optimal returns for its customers.
The SGRE segment’s Wind Turbines business generated total revenue in the amount of
€8.6 billion (or 84% of the SGRE segment’s total revenue) in the fiscal year 2019, thereof
€5.2 billion attributable to the Onshore business unit and €3.4 billion to the Offshore business
unit. SGRE’s Service business generated total revenue in the amount of €1,617 million (or 15.8%
of the SGRE segment’s total revenue), in the fiscal year 2019. During the fiscal year 2019, ourSGRE segment received Orders amounting to €12.7 billion (as stated in the “Orders” line item
corresponding to SGRE in Note 24 to the Combined Financial Statements). From those orders,€10.0 billion related to Wind Turbines (thereof €6.9 billion in Onshore and €3.1 billion in
Offshore) and €2.7 billion to Service.
Our SGRE segment develops and manufactures wind turbines which are suitable for a broad
range of wind speeds (low, medium and high wind) and a full spectrum of weather conditions,and which are capable of fulfilling specific local requirements. Every wind generation locationpresents specific challenges, which require the choice of the most appropriate product. To meetthe specific needs of its customers, SGRE offers versatile solutions for onshore and offshorepower plants.
According to its “one segment, one technology” strategy, SGRE uses mainly geared technology
for onshore and direct drive technology for offshore wind turbines. In the direct drivetechnology, a low-speed permanent magnet replaces the gearbox, the coupling and the high-speed generator, combining simplicity with a high level of efficiency (see also “ 12.4.1.3 Offshore
Wind Turbines ”).
With wind turbines installed in more than 70 countries worldwide, having a total capacity of
more than 100 GW as of June 30, 2020, and a full range of product platforms, SGRE sees itself asone of the main global technological leaders in the multi-megawatt wind turbine segment. OurSGRE segment had wind turbines with over 1 GW installed in each of the following 16 countriesas of September 30, 2019 (based on cumulative installed capacity figures, including all SGREonshore and offshore wind turbines for each country): United States, Spain, United Kingdom,Germany, India, China, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Italy, Denmark, France, Sweden, Turkey Egypt andPoland.
Offshore projects are typically significantly larger in size than onshore projects. For example, one
recent reference offshore project is Hornsea One in the United Kingdom, the world’s largestoffshore wind power plant commissioned to date (source: Ørsted’s website for the project,hornseaprojectone.co.uk, section “About the project”), in which 174 SGRE offshore turbines wereinstalled. With a total capacity of 1.2 GW, the plant can power over 1 million homes. In addition,in June 2020, SGRE conditionally received an order for 100 units of its new SG 14-222 DD offshorewind turbine for Innogy’s 1.4 GW Sofia offshore wind power plant in the United Kingdom. Whencompleted, the project will have the capacity to generate enough electricity to power more than1.2 million British households (source: Power Technology website, information on Sofia offshorewind project, available from https://www.power-technology.com/projects/sofia-offshore-wind-farm/).
For the onshore business, reference projects include a landmark order for 35 units of its new SG
5.8-155 turbine (the most powerful geared onshore wind turbine so far, according to SGRE) forthe 231 MW Skaftåsen project in Sweden. The turbines will be installed with flexible powerrating operating at 6.6 MW, and they will be covered by a 30-year full-service agreement. Thefirst of the 35 units is expected to be installed in the second quarter of 2021. In 2020, SGREreceived additional orders for the SG 5.8-170 variant of its 5.X onshore platform for furtherprojects in Sweden and in other countries like Brazil.
326
In addition, our SGRE segment has a track record of excellence in operation and maintenance (for
more details, see “ 12.4.1.4 Services ”). Leveraging scale and global reach, and also capitalizing on
its extensive fleet of installed wind turbines, SGRE offers a flexible service portfolio that can betailored to its customers’ diverse operating models. SGRE also provides advanced diagnostics anddigitalization capabilities, as well as customized offshore services. Recently, SGRE was able toextend the service agreement for the 288 MW Meerwind project off the German Northern Seacoast for an additional seven and a half years, with an option for a further three-year extensionperiod. Moreover, in 2020, SGRE signed a 20-year service agreement and another 30-year serviceagreement for Senvion turbines for two wind projects in Australia with a combined capacityrating of approximately 360 MW.
12.4.1.1 Overview of Wind Class Classification
The characteristics of the wind turbines in SGRE’s portfolio vary depending on the type of
location for which they are designed. The industry uses a classification of wind classes thatfocuses on aspects such as wind speed (both maximum and average wind speeds at a certainlocation are considered), extreme gusts and turbulence. The International ElectrotechnicalCommission (“ IEC”) sets international standards for the wind speeds each wind class must
withstand; the latest version is contained in “IEC 61400 – Edition 4” (2019). The IEC windclassification goes from Class IEC I (high wind), over IEC II (medium wind) to IEC III (low wind). Inaddition, wind class “S” refers to parameters that are user-defined and/or location-specific, whilewind class “T” is used for tropical cyclone classes (typhoon, hurricane and cyclone). In addition,the suffix “A”, “B” or “C” used after the roman number corresponding to a wind class refers tothe categories of higher, medium and lower turbulence intensity characteristics, respectively.Some of the IEC standards provide technical conditions verifiable by an independent, third partyand as such are necessary in order to enter into agreements relating to financing and erection ofwind turbines. In certain countries, like in the United States for offshore wind turbines, thefulfillment of further standards may be required.
12.4.1.2 Onshore Wind Turbines
SGRE’s onshore approach focuses on geared technology, in which it has extensive knowledge and
expertise. SGRE’s onshore portfolio relies on proven concepts with extensive track record in themarket and which offer high levels of reliability, such as the combination of a three-stagegearbox and a doubly-fed induction generator. Other advantages of SGRE turbines arerobustness and a modular, flexible design and flexible power ratings for optimum adaptationand maximization of production at different kinds of sites and in all wind conditions.
The following chart provides an overview of SGRE’s main onshore wind turbine platforms
currently being offered and product variants. In addition, several products from the formeronshore Siemens and Gamesa portfolio are still available for selected projects.

Note: Siemens Gamesa 5.X platform and the SG 3.4-145 within the Siemens Gamesa 3.X platform are not yet in serial production.
First prototypes of the Siemens Gamesa 5.X platform are expected to be delivered towards the end of 2020. The new SG 3.4-145turbine has been commissioned in a Spanish wind farm in 2020; it is already being commercialized and is expected to begincommercial production in India in 2021.
As of September 30, 2019, SGRE had installed onshore wind turbines with a total capacity of
approximately 84 GW in more than 70 countries as well as an Onshore Order Backlog of€7 billion.
12.4.1.2.1 Siemens Gamesa 2.X Platform
SGRE’s 2.X platform had more than 57 GW installed in the 2.0-2.9 MW segment as of
September 30, 2019, with fleet availability levels exceeding 98%. With a comprehensive portfolioof rotors, towers and adaptable environmental options, the versatile SGRE 2.X platform offersoptimal performance in all types of sites and wind conditions.
SG 2.1-114
Boasting a 114-meter rotor, various tower options (from 68 to 153 meters) and nominal power of
2.1 MW, the SG 2.1-114 wind turbine is the benchmark in the sector for medium- and low-windsites within SGRE’s 2.X platform. This model has low power density, allowing maximumprofitability at sites with moderate and low winds. A significant backlog of orders and a strongmarket presence bears testament to this, with over 6,400 MW installed worldwide as ofSeptember 30, 2019. SGRE also offers optimized solutions based on this model for Class S sites, soit can be adapted to the environmental conditions in markets such as India, China and Brazil.With a 56-meter blade and aerodynamic profiles developed using state-of-the-art technology,the SG 2.1-114 wind turbine enables maximum energy production combined with low noiseemission thanks to the “DinoTails Next Generation” serrated trailing edges. Furthermore, byapplying comprehensively validated and certified technologies from the SGRE 2.X platform, thisturbine significantly reduces the LCoE.
SG 2.2-122
The SG 2.2-122 wind turbine is one of the latest additions to the SGRE 2.X product platform, with
a high capacity factor and profitability. Specifically optimized for low-wind low-turbulenceconditions, this model seeks competitive positioning in markets with locations of this type, suchas India. With a 122-meter rotor combined with a 2.2 MW generator, this turbine addressescustomers’ needs at Class S sites thanks to its extremely low power density and reduced LCoE. TheSG 2.2-122 wind turbine has a 60-meter blade. This is a new development from the 56-metervariant extensively validated in SGRE projects involving wind turbines with a 114-meter rotor,through which maximum production has been achieved. In addition, the electrical system that itincorporates is also common to all other SGRE solutions with 2.1 MW of nominal power.
SG 2.6-114
The SG 2.6-114 wind turbine is designed for medium- and high-wind sites. This model
complements the SGRE 2.1 MW offer in projects requiring higher nominal power. With a114-meter rotor, various tower options (from 63 to 125 meters) and increased nominal power ofup to 2.625 MW, this turbine enables maximum efficiency at a reduced LCoE. It is a naturalevolution of the SG 2.1-114 model and inherits most of the technologies, components andsubsystems while incorporating the necessary modifications to achieve increased power. Byincorporating a 56-meter blade, designed by SGRE using advanced technologies and specificallyreinforced for sites with moderate and high winds, along with a 2.625 MW generator, SGRE hasbeen able to increase the turbine yield by over 13% and achieve a significant reduction in theLCoE compared to the SG 2.1-114 model. This makes the SG 2.6-114 turbine one of the mostefficient and cost-effective solutions available to SGRE’s customers.
328
SG 2.9-129
The SG 2.9-129 wind turbine is the latest SGRE onshore turbine developed to meet the medium
to low-wind site and market conditions of the American market. The turbine is designed basedon the foundation of the proven 2.3 MW geared product series and maintains a similar design,utilizing components from its predecessor, the SWT-2.625-120. To deliver a low LCoE andmaximize performance across various sites in the United States, the SG 2.9-129 wind turbine isdesigned with a higher capacity factor that customers in that country demand. This improvedmodel demonstrates SGRE’s ability to offer flexible solutions for every context while delivering acertified 25-year design lifetime on a standard basis.
The experience acquired through SGRE’s latest products, specifically in the optimization of
design, prototyping, validation and industrialization processes, along with enhanced design toolssuch as “Finite Element Analysis” (for the simulation of physical phenomena), thermal modelingand grid analysis, has been a key factor in the development of the SG 2.9-129 wind turbine. SGREhas incorporated proven technologies into this wind turbine, boosting capacity and simplifyingmaintenance.
12.4.1.2.2 Siemens Gamesa 3.X Platform
The SGRE 3.X product line completes the product offering for medium and high-wind sites,
where customers require a nominal power rating between 3 and 4 MW at an optimum LCoE.Within this platform, several tower height options make it possible to comply with various bladetip height restrictions.
SG 3.4-132
The SG 3.4-132 wind turbine complements SGRE’s product offering for medium- and high-wind
sites in markets where customers require solutions with nominal powers higher than 3 MW withan optimum Levelized Cost of Energy.
The SG 3.4-132 turbine, available for locations with high and moderate wind conditions,
improves on the production capacity of the SG 2.6-114 model, both increasing the nominal powerup to 3.465 MW and increasing the rotor swept area by 34%. This model also has an extensiveportfolio of towers with heights ranging from 84 to 165 meters, which enables it to comply withthe different maximum blade tip height restrictions in the market. With a new 64.5-meterfiberglass blade, especially developed for medium- and high-wind sites and with high-qualityairfoils, the SG 3.4-132 model was developed for both high energy production and low noiseemission levels due to the “DinoTails Next Generation” serrated trailing edges. SGRE incorporatesproven technology into this model, such as the combination of a three-stage gearbox (twoplanetary stages and one parallel) and a doubly-fed induction generator, which is also used inthe SGRE 2.X platform.
SG 3.4-145
In July 2020, SGRE presented the new SG 3.4-145 wind turbine, which is specifically designed and
optimized for wind conditions in India (Class S/III). The turbine is based on the SG 3.4-132, whichhas several GW installed worldwide.
The SG 3.4-145 turbine delivers a nominal power of 3.465 MW and can operate up to 3.6 MW
under specific site conditions. With an increased rotor swept area of 41%, which delivers 48%more AEP than its predecessor model in India (the SG 2.2-122 turbine), the SG 3.4-145 model isone of the most efficient and cost-effective solutions in the market, according to our assessment.This model stands 127.5 meters tall, with a blade-tip height of 200 meters, which helps to harnessthe maximum available wind potential at every site. With a 71-meter fiberglass blade, optimizedfor low-wind sites along with thoroughly tested and validated air foils, the SG 3.4-145 modelenables both high-energy production and low-noise emission levels. The high-performancepassive cooler outside the nacelle and the cabinets’ improved ventilation ensures efficientthermal conditioning and performance at high-temperature sites.
329
A prototype of this turbine was commissioned successfully in the Alaiz wind farm in Spain. The
SG 3.4-145 turbine is already being commercialized and is expected to begin commercialproduction in SGRE’s facilities in India starting in early 2021. The SG 3.4-145 wind turbine hasbeen designed to comply with the global IECRE Standards and meets the Indian CEA 2019requirements.
12.4.1.2.3 Siemens Gamesa 4.X Platform
The SGRE 4.X platform is one of the latest additions to the SGRE product portfolio, designed to
deliver an outstanding LCoE for turbines with nominal power ratings in the 4 MW segment. Dueto the modularity and flexibility of these turbines, they are suitable for a variety of sites. SGRE’s4.X platform incorporates proven technologies, significantly minimizing technological risks, whilealso integrating innovative technologies to achieve higher efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
SG 5.0-132 and 5.0-145
The SGRE 4.X platform consists of the SG 5.0-145 and the SG 5.0-132 wind turbines, two
benchmark solutions in the market for sites with medium and high winds. With a new controlsystem, enhanced blade aerodynamics and structural modularity, both the SG 5.0-145 and SG5.0-132 wind turbines offer SGRE’s customers higher flexibility to adapt to sites with a widerange of wind conditions and logistics constraints. SGRE’s 4.X platform uses proven concepts withextensive track record in the market, such as the combination of a three-stage gearbox (twoplanetary and one parallel) and a doubly-fed induction generator, offering high levels ofreliability. In addition to this, the inclusion of an optional premium converter allows SGRE’s 4.Xwind turbines to meet demanding grid connection requirements. The new 71-meter and64.5-meter blades, made of fiberglass reinforced with epoxy resin, integrate innovativeaerodynamics. The DinoTails
®Next Generation technology enables a balance between high
energy production and reduced noise emission levels. SGRE’s 4.X platform introduces a newcontrol system to optimize the efficiency of the wind turbines and their applicability in a widerange of sites. It also offers flexible power rating, depending on the noise requirements,temperature and electrical properties of the project. The SG 5.0-145 and SG 5.0-132 models allowfor an increase in annual energy production (“ AEP”) of more than 30% compared to previous
solutions from the SGRE 3.X platform.
12.4.1.2.4 Siemens Gamesa 5.X Platform
The SGRE 5.X platform achieves new parameters in terms of performance, cost-efficiency and
reliability: in power output, with 5.8 MW and a rotor size of 155 and 170 meters, depending onthe variant, for a highly competitive LCoE; in technology, based on SGRE’s know-how andexpertise; in versatility, with a highly flexible design for logistics, construction and service; in siteadaptability, to configure the optimal solution for each project and, ultimately, in value forSGRE’s customers. SGRE’s 5.X platform was announced in April 2019 and is not yet in serialproduction. SGRE expects that first prototypes of the turbine models of this platform will beavailable towards the end of 2020.
SG 5.8-155 and SG 5.8-170
The SG 5.8-155 and SG 5.8-170 wind turbines include a doubly-fed generator and partial
converter combination, a compact drive train design with a three-stage gearbox, and the use ofcomponents widely validated on the other SGRE platforms. The result is a wind turbine designthat delivers optimum performance and LCoE. SGRE’s 5.X platform is a new generation platformwith a high unitary power rating of 5.8 MW combined with two of the largest rotor diameterscurrently in the market, 155 and 170 meters (depending on the variant), resulting in maximumperformance in high-, medium- and low-wind conditions.
The SG 5.8-155 and SG 5.8-170 turbines allow for a higher AEP per wind turbine and optimized
capital expenditures for wind projects compared to previous generations. This is also due to theirversatility, a modular, flexible design for maximum ease of logistics, construction and O&M,reducing the operational expenditure, which results in a lower LCoE for projects.
330
The SGRE 5.X platform focuses on enhancing profitability as a key factor in generating value for
SGRE’s customers. Contributing factors to profitability include (i) a flexible, personalizedconfiguration of power modes fully tailored to the needs of each site, (ii) an extensive catalog oftowers with multiple available technologies and the additional capability to create specificproject designs, (iii) the use of advanced control strategies that enable intelligent load reductionand a greater applicability for the SGRE 5.X platform in different wind conditions, (iv) a modular,optimized structure for local transport and construction conditions, (iv) a maintainability-oriented design with advanced diagnostics and remote operation solutions, as well as thepossibility of replacing main components without requiring a crane, and (v) optional productsolutions to cover all types of market requirements.
SGRE has already secured orders for the 5.X platform, for example for projects in Sweden and in
Brazil (see “ 12.4.1 Products and Services ”).
12.4.1.2.5 Legacy Onshore Wind Turbines
Certain onshore products from the former Siemens Wind Power and Gamesa portfolios are still
available for selected projects. SGRE’s legacy portfolio includes, among others, the followingwind turbines (which are based on the direct drive technology): the SWT-DD-120 and theSWT-DD-130 turbines, both with a nominal power from 3.9 to 4.3 MW and a rotor length of 120meters and 130 meters, respectively, as well as the SWT-DD-142 model, with a nominal powerranging from 3.5 MW to 4.1 MW and 142-meter rotor length.
12.4.1.3 Offshore Wind Turbines
SGRE’s offshore approach is focused on direct drive technology (as opposed to geared technology
for the onshore products), which is particularly suitable for offshore conditions. Replacing thegearbox, main shaft and a conventional high-speed generator with a low-speed generatoreliminates two-thirds of the conventional drive train arrangement. As a result, the number ofrotating and wear-prone parts is vastly reduced, so that a SGRE Direct Drive wind turbine has50% fewer moving parts than a comparable geared machine. The simplistic design also translatesinto lower weights. Furthermore, it reduces the likelihood of failures, and the use of fewermoving parts in the direct drive technology (compared to geared machines) also means fewerspare parts are needed over the course of a wind power plant’s lifetime.
The following chart provides an overview of SGRE’s current offshore wind turbine portfolio
(platforms and product variants):

Note: “DD” stands for “direct drive”. The models marked with an asterisk (*) are now being sold, but serial production is planned
to begin later. For more information, see the description below.
SGRE ventured into offshore as a pioneer in 1991, installing the first commercial offshore wind
power plant (Vindeby project) off the coast of Denmark. As of September 30, 2019, SGRE had
331
installed offshore wind turbines with a total capacity of approximately 15 GW worldwide as well
as an Offshore Order Backlog of €7 billion.
SWT-6.0-154
The SWT-6.0-154 has a 6 MW output and a swept area of 18,600 square meters, making it an
ideal offshore solution. The drive train design has evolved from an onshore 3 MW direct drivedesign with enhanced electrical components and upgraded magnets adapting it to the harshoffshore wind environment. This turbine comes with a 154-meter rotor and 75-meter blades, andhas been designed for Class I or S sites, i.e., for high-wind and high-turbulence offshore
environments where reliability matters most.
SWT-7.0-154
With high-energy production and assured reliability, the SWT-7.0-154 is a Class I/S design with an
increased MW rating. It features small upgrades in the electrical components (converter,transformer) and magnets compared to the proven 6 MW technology. Staying within theSWT-6.0-154 design envelope, the 7 MW variant offers various advantages: a shorter certificationprocess, re-use of equipment and tools, known manufacturing and installation processes as wellas minimal balance-of-plant supply chain impact from turbine configuration.
SG 8.0-167 DD
The 8 MW version of the SGRE Offshore Direct Drive platform, the SG 8.0-167 DD, allows for even
higher energy yields (compared to previous SGRE offshore turbines) at all wind speeds. Byintegrating proven concepts together with an increased rotor size, the latest offshore DirectDrive turbine combines lower risk and improved energy output in terms of AEP. The 8 MW ratingis made possible by using new and more powerful magnet technology with an even higher gradethan in previous models. A Siemens Integrated Control System (SICS) ensures optimized control ofpower- and grid performance. By introducing a larger rotor (with a diameter of 167 meters)using the new aerodynamic 81.4-meter-long B81 blades, the SG 8.0-167 DD is able to yield up to20% higher AEP than the 7 MW Direct Drive turbine. The fact that – with the exception of theblades, which are now longer – SGRE utilizes components that are already in play in other modelsalso means operating with an established supply chain and established, standardized processes. Italso reduces product risks and enables the manufacturing of high volumes and a fasttime-to-market. This wind turbine is available in different variants, including Typhoon wind classand a high temperature package to cater to varying regional market conditions. The productionstart of the SG 8.0-167DD was in the European autumn of 2019 – by which time over 1,000 unitsof the Direct Drive offshore turbine family had been installed since such Direct Drive offshoreturbines were launched in 2011.
SG 11.0-200 DD
The new SG 11.200 DD was publicly presented in February 2020 and is scheduled for serial
production in 2022. The 11 MW rating is made possible through a larger generator diameter,reusing the proven Direct Drive generator technology. By increasing the rotor diameter to animpressive 200 meters with 97-meter-long blades, the SG 11.0-200 DD offers up to 40% more AEPthan the SG 8.0-167 DD under similar conditions. The most significant change compared toprevious models is the introduction of carbon in the blade, which was first introduced in theonshore blade portfolio, to achieve lighter and stiffer blades. The rest of the components aretried and tested over generations of offshore turbines, including the Direct Drive technology,“IntegralBlade” technology, tower concepts, as well as maintenance and safety systems. Featuressuch as “High Wind Ride Through” and the power boost function enable the turbine to maintainan industry leading availability. Again, building the new turbine based on the experience ofprevious turbine generations allows SGRE to improve profitability and reduce risk for itscustomers. It is designed for high-wind classes (I, S).
In June 2020, SGRE received a firm order for 140 SG 11.0-200 DD wind turbines for the subsidy-
free projects Hollandse Kust Zuid I to IV off the Netherlands. The project will feature nearly 1.5
332
GW of installed power and is expected to be commissioned in 2023. The new SG 11.0-200 DD
offshore wind turbine is also planned to be deployed, for example, in two offshore projects,Borkum Riffgrund 3 and Gode Wind 3 (which is still subject to certain conditions), in the GermanNorth Sea totaling 1,142 GW (for more information, see the introduction under “ 12.4.1 Products
and Services ”).
SG 14-222 DD
In May 2020, SGRE announced the SG 14-222 DD offshore wind turbine, released with a
nameplate capacity of 14 MW, but which can reach 15 MW with a “power boost” option. Thisnew wind turbine is designed with a 222-meter rotor diameter and massive 108-meter longblades, and particularly for wind class I, S. According to SGRE’s calculations, this new turbinewould avoid approximately 1.4 million tons of CO
2emissions per machine over the turbine’s
projected 25-year lifetime. The SG 14-222 turbine offers over 25% more AEP than the SG 11.0-200DD offshore wind turbine under similar conditions. It is designed with a light 500-ton nacelleweight that enables optimized substructure at lower cost. SGRE plans to have a first prototypeready in 2021 and currently expects that this turbine will be commercially available in 2024. Forexample, in late May 2020, SGRE’s new SG 14-222 DD offshore wind turbine was selected to beused at the upcoming 300 MW Hai Long 2 project. The deployment of the turbine for the rest ofthe 1,044 MW Hai Long pipeline is also being considered. The exact number of units for the first300 MW of the project remains to be confirmed based on site-specific conditions, and thepreferred supplier agreement remains subject to certain conditions (for more information, seethe introduction under “ 12.4.1 Products and Services ”). In May 2020, SGRE was named as the
preferred turbine supplier to supply its SG 14-222 Direct Drive offshore wind turbines to the 2,640MW Dominion Energy Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (“ CVOW ”) project, the largest offshore
project to-date in the United States (according to Dominion Energy’s website section regardingthe CVOW project), with turbine installations expected to be completed by 2026. Decisions onsourcing and supply chain to serve the U.S. market are expected to be made within 2021. Inaddition, in June 2020, SGRE conditionally received an order for 100 units of this newSG 14-222 DD offshore wind turbine for Innogy’s 1.4 GW Sofia offshore wind power plant in theUnited Kingdom, among other projects.
12.4.1.4 Services
The Service business of our SGRE segment is responsible for the management, monitoring and
maintenance of wind power plants. As of June 30, 2020, SGRE reported a service Order Backlogof€15 billion. The average duration of the order book is approximately nine years (as of
June 30, 2020). Our SGRE segment had roughly 32,000 serviced turbines worldwide, with morethan 72 GW under maintenance (including approximately 11 GW from the offshore fleet undermaintenance and approximately 61 GW relating to the onshore fleet under maintenance, whichincludes the fleet acquired in connection with the Senvion Acquisition) as of June 30, 2020. SGREcurrently delivers high-quality O&M services with a global reach and has service operations inmore than 60 countries around the world through its five regional and two global competencecenters.
SGRE’s Service business unit supports its customers’ business models in multiple ways. These
include maximizing SGRE’s customers’ wind power plant revenue through efficient maintenanceand repair solutions, mitigating customers’ financial and business risk through SGRE’sperformance and component warranties, or increasing the energy production and thus thereturn on investment of customers’ wind power plants through performance upgrades andlifetime extensions. In addition, by providing innovative offshore logistics for far-shore site accessor combining its intelligent analytics with unique domain know-how into knowledge products,SGRE aims to deliver an optimized maintenance strategy for a wide range of customers.
Our SGRE segment’s services can be tailored, depending on the customer’s specific operational
needs. These range from models under which experienced customers assume part of the risk,over comprehensive services that include service from upgrades and expert analysis, to assetmanagement, where our SGRE segment manages a wind power plant for the customer.
333
Our SGRE segment capitalizes on its own extensive fleet of installed wind turbines (89 GW
onshore and 16 GW offshore as of June 30, 2020), most of which, in particular in the yearsfollowing installation and in many cases based on long-term agreements, is being serviced bySGRE based on long term agreements with contract durations up to 30 years. In addition, SGREstrives to increase its share of service of third-party turbine fleets, pursuing service contracts forother manufacturers’ turbines, which was, for example, one of the rationales behind the SenvionAcquisition (for more information, see “ 12.9.3 Acquisition of Selected European Assets of
Senvion ”).
Our SGRE segment offers a range of services that can be purchased through tailor-made long-
term contracts or on a more transactional basis, aligned with individual customer needs. OurO&M contracts are designed in a flexible manner, with many different selectable modules basedon core services (the modules are described in more detail in the following sections). A typicalO&M contract includes fundamental maintenance services, including preventive (bothpre-determined and condition-based) and corrective work scope. The scope typically covers worksperformed physically on-site, but also extensive remote maintenance activities performed by ourSGRE segment’s global network of monitoring & diagnostics centers. O&M contracts are usuallybacked by a performance warranty (described in more detail further below) which providesassurance to the customer that SGRE will maintain their asset with the required quality. Our SGREsegment refers to an extensive scope O&M contract with a term of ten or more years as a long-term program, and its Service business unit focuses on attracting customers to such deals, whichprovide long-term profitable revenue streams and a significant contribution to our SGREsegment’s Order Backlog as a whole.
12.4.1.4.1 Performance Guarantees
In our SGRE segment, O&M agreements are usually supported by an availability warranty as a
mechanism to provide our customers with assurance that our products will perform well on theirsite. The warranties are typically either based on percentage uptime of the asset (time-basedwarranty) or percentage of theoretical maximum energy yield from the asset (yield-basedwarranty). Our SGRE segment offers competitive levels of warranted availability. In the event ofperformance below that level, the customer would be able to recover the missing revenue arisingfrom such underperformance. These warranties are an important part of our SGRE segment’svalue proposition to its customers as they ensure that customers benefit from a clear allocationof risk as well as providing a cost-effective mechanism through which SGRE can assume thoserisks from the customer’s project that our SGRE segment is well-positioned to manage andmitigate.
Our SGRE segment’s most recent innovation track in this area is the development of a “revenue-
based availability” tool, which measures and incentivizes performance on the basis not just of thecustomer’s energy generation, but also on the basis of revenues obtained from the sale of thatenergy. This is an important move to ensure that incentives and operating model are properlyaligned with the value drivers of the customer business case of our SGRE segment, since theindustry now has an ever increasing number of wind turbines moving into low-subsidy or post-subsidy environments. This increases the importance of taking into consideration the marketenergy price when planning and conducting O&M.
The first pilot contract using this availability tool has already been signed, and development is
well underway to formalize the product as a standard offering of our SGRE segment.
12.4.1.4.2 Life Extension Services
As installed wind turbine technology ages and in order to address increasing customer interest to
maximize the profitability of their installed assets for longer, SGRE offers a “Life Extension”service which allows for the extension of the useful lives of a customer’s turbines from typically20 to up to 30 years (counted as from the start of operation of the turbine). This is a full-scopemaintenance program including a series of structural upgrades and monitoring features toensure that customers’ wind turbines are safe to operate while extending energy production
334
beyond the original design life. With this service, SGRE offers its customers a guarantee relating
to the safety for the public, personnel and wind power plant assets, while keeping customers’maintenance costs under control during the extended life period.
Since 2014, SGRE has performed life extension services, with lifetime assessments being carried
out across more than 2,800 wind turbine generators as of November 30, 2019. Through itsinternal lifetime modeling, SGRE’s Life Extension program combines a number of parameters,such as turbine failure rates, structural analysis or turbine field data, to offer a specific, tailor-made maintenance for each type of platform and for the full remaining lifetime of the windturbine. This can be further enhanced by implementation of necessary upgrades to bring theturbine up to the latest state-of-the-art, including repairs, reinforcements and componentssubstitutions to achieve enhanced performance of customer assets.
12.4.1.4.3 Annual Energy Production Upgrades
Through its AEP upgrade solutions such as “Energy Thrust”, “Power Boost”, “Power Curve
Upgrade” or “High Wind Ride Through”, our SGRE segment updates older wind turbines withthe latest performance enhancement technology. This results in improved wind turbine output,which can increase AEP by up to 5%, depending on the variant and without compromising theturbine’s structural integrity. The additional energy is obtained through the adaptation of eachturbine to the specific wind conditions of its location by software and firmware updates,resulting in improved performance in all ranges of the power curve. These products are validatedby our SGRE segment and required assessments are obtained from an independent assuranceprovider, such as DNV GL SE (Germany).
Our SGRE segment is continuously innovating, and by combining its extensive turbine design,
field performance data and advanced analytics modeling, it explores new ways for performanceupgrades to allow for the best possible wind power plant asset management in line with itscustomers’ business objectives.
12.4.1.4.4 Offshore Logistics
The new generation of offshore wind power plants is often located far from shore, which
generally means unstable weather conditions, significant wave heights and increased travel timefor spare parts and technicians. In addition, both wind power plants and wind turbines continueto increase in size. Traditionally, the farther an offshore wind power plant was from shore, themore expensive its maintenance. To address this, our SGRE segment introduced service operationvessels that work as floating workshops, thereby significantly reducing costs. Our SGRE segment’sintegrated logistics are focused on achieving maximum yield and overcoming challengingconditions when servicing offshore wind power plants. Customers can choose from serviceoperations vessels, helicopter services or crew transfer vessels for regular maintenanceoperations. When a heavy component exchange is needed, chartered jack-up vessels can bedeployed quickly. Our SGRE segment’s service offering for offshore wind power plants improvesoffshore wind power plant availability through greater efficiency, less weather downtime due tosafe operation at high waves and fast response to service needs by operation within theboundaries of its customers’ wind power plants. In the fiscal year 2019, our SGRE segmentintroduced a “service train” concept by which it deploys one common vessel across multiple windpower plants with several customers to reduce the downtime associated with scheduled service.In addition, it also introduced a program aimed at securing a safe and reliable installation andstart-up of each offshore wind turbine within 24 hours.
12.4.1.4.5 Blade Services
Blades have a direct impact on the quantity as well as the cost of the energy that turbines
produce. They are the most expensive components of a wind turbine. They are also vulnerablecomponents, since they bear extreme loads and weather conditions, thus requiring professionalcare. If blades are not checked for damage and wear at suitable intervals, turbine yield canpotentially decrease over time. Our SGRE segment offers different services for blades of onshore
335
and offshore wind turbines, including blade inspections (with reporting and assessment), repairs,
upgrades and updates, blade integrity management and artificial intelligence solutions.
For example, our SGRE segment combines drone inspection data with an online platform called
Hermes AI, which is presented through a graphic user interface called Vision Based Asset Integrity(“VBAI ”) that controls the process. VBAI’s artificial intelligence (“ AI”) uses the power of cloud
computing, AI, machine learning, big data and specialist interaction to enable predictivemaintenance and statistics as well as to identify blade damage. Customers receive a thoroughanalysis of their turbine’s blade conditions and sufficient data to make informed decisions aboutany necessary repair.
Furthermore, “PowerEdge” Care is a durable and cost-optimized protection solution that
mitigates the impact of erosion to the leading edge of the blades. “PowerEdge” Care is designedas a lifetime solution to prevent reoccurring repairs, thus minimizing the turbine’s downtime andproviding an AEP improvement relative to eroded blades. The overall solution is validated bySGRE and has been certified by DNV GL SE.
12.4.1.4.6 Diagnostics
Our SGRE segment’s remote diagnostics approach encompasses a wide range of digital tools
supporting the service of customer assets and is available for all onshore and offshore windturbines and wind power plants. Diagnostics services include (i) 24/7 alarm notification andmanagement ( e.g., so that when an alarm is detected, knowledge-based alarm rules are applied
to quickly and accurately reset and restart a turbine without a site visit), (ii) software versionupdates, (iii) diagnostic support ( e.g., to remotely identify the cause for an alarm and try to fix it
remotely, or suggest on-site actions), (iv) turbine set-up control (a detection service thatrecognizes any changes in a wind turbine generator from the parameters defined in its profile),(v) basic, advanced and model-based vibration, (vi) antivirus protecting solutions and (vii) oilparticle counters. With respect to vibration diagnostics, by picking up vibrations on turbinecomponents, sensors can lower the risk of slow- and fast-developing damages by early detection,and optimize maintenance strategies – such as automatic turbine shutdown or preventive repair.This helps to save service costs and reduce downtime. In addition, advanced vibration diagnosticstools that accurately pinpoint vibrations within the drivetrain (composed of the gearbox and thegenerator, which the wind turbine needs to produce electricity) allow to predict damage up tothree years in advance, allowing for optimized risk and asset management, and minimizingdowntime.
Through model-based diagnostics, our SGRE segment gathers data from around 6 million sensors
from turbines worldwide and creates roughly 1.5 million individual digital models of theturbines’ ancillary systems. The system flags around 250,000 deviations per year but not all ofthese positives correspond to real-life faults. Algorithms filter out the costly false-positives andinsignificant deviations. This drops the count of significant deviations that need to be addressedto approximately 8,000 site visits a year. In addition, service technicians’ reports and the analysisof damaged parts are fed into a knowledge base supporting several digital tools.
12.4.1.4.7 Multi-brand Maintenance Services
In the rapidly changing market environment of the wind industry, wind turbine fleets of most
wind turbine operators show an increased diversity of technologies. As owners grow their fleetsizes, most expand their fleets beyond a single turbine manufacturer, either due to economics,performance, or through the integration of fleets from M&A activities. The Service marketsegment is becoming increasingly complex for service providers and owners alike. Frominefficient repair loops, over unexpected and unbudgeted failures well outside of the warrantyperiod, to older equipment with limited attention or supply chain, or even to turbinemanufacturers shifting focus and, in some cases, even leaving markets, the areas where ownersrequire innovative engineering approaches are numerous.
SGRE possesses specialized know-how and valuable insights for multiple brands and maintains
turbines of many serial OEMs. The fleet of third-party technologies under maintenance (including
336
Vestas, GE, Nordex, Suzlon, Senvion, legacy MADE, Bonus, Adwen and other technologies) had
1.7 GW installed capacity in total at the end of the fiscal year 2019. Multi-brand services can beattractive for onshore and offshore wind power plants with mixed brands, irrespective of thewind power plant’s size, and wind power plant owners who are looking for alternative O&Mproviders, since such multi-brand services allow leveraging economies of scale. The SenvionAcquisition, including a large part of Senvion’s European onshore service business and associatedassets and operations to provide full service, positions our SGRE segment to service a broaderrange of wind turbine technologies. The transaction added around 9 GW of serviced fleet andoperations in 13 countries, taking our SGRE segment’s multi-brand footprint to more than 10 GWand its fleet under maintenance to approximately 72 GW (as of June 30, 2020). In addition, sincethe closing of the transaction, SGRE has secured several orders relating to the Senvion fleet,including onshore and offshore contracts. Thus, with the acquisition, our SGRE segmentsignificantly increased its “Other OEM” fleet under maintenance.
Leveraging global reach, our SGRE segment offers a flexible service portfolio that can be tailored
to its customers’ diverse operating models and needs. Providing an integrated assetmanagement, our SGRE segment’s services range from corrective and preventive maintenance toupgrades and from balance of plant solutions to energy management services. It also providesadvanced diagnostics and other data-driven capabilities, as well as customized offshore services.
12.4.1.5 New Adjacent Business Fields
With the rapid development of renewable energies, our SGRE segment has begun to enter into
new, adjacent business fields within the area of renewable electricity generation, such as solar,hybrid solutions, storage, floating or hydrogen. However, these activities represent only a smallfraction of SGRE’s current business.
Solar – Our SGRE segment has recently offered solar downstream services, mainly in India,
which are currently not considered part of SGRE’s core business. In addition, SGREmanufactures solar inverters through its subsidiary Gamesa Electric. However, SGRE iscontinuously reviewing its business performance and market development to adjust its strategyaccordingly, for example as part of the restructuring in India.
Hybrid – As the market evolves, our SGRE segment is expanding into the growing hybrid power
solutions market segment. These solutions combine multiple power generation sources,including wind. Hybrid power leverages the advantages of the complementary energy profilesof wind and solar power, for example by balancing the energy generated by solar powerduring the day with the wind, which is usually stronger at night. Depending on location andhourly profile, a hybrid system can optimize energy feed-in, grid stability and capacity factor.In addition, customers can save costs and achieve a higher energy production by sharing land,grid infrastructure and maintenance services for the different assets.
Storage – As the energy sector increasingly shifts towards a growing share of renewables, it
faces new challenges, including the fluctuation of energy generation as well as the issue ofstranded costs for early phase-out of conventional power plants. Our SGRE segment iscontinuously monitoring storage related solutions and technologies. For example, our SGREsegment has recently invested in electric thermal energy storage (“ ETES ”). The first test site
with 5 MWh capacity was implemented in 2014. For the proof of system, SGRE opened a newpilot plant in Hamburg-Altenwerder in June 2019. SGRE is exploring alternatives around thenext steps in the development of its ETES technology.
Floating – At present, the offshore market has certain limitations on expansion due to the
technology used for offshore turbine foundations (called monopoles) which are embeddedinto the sea floor. The cost-effectiveness of the solution is challenged when water depthexceeds 40 meters. SGRE’s Offshore business unit is actively exploring floating foundations thatwill allow the deployment of wind power plants in deeper waters near heavily-populatedcoastal areas with proper wind resources, such as the East Chinese sea, the U.S. Eastern coast,the gulf of Vizcaya or the Irish sea. Several prototypes are expected to be tested during thecourse of 2021 and 2022.
337
Hydrogen – Green hydrogen production is projected to increase during the next years as the
energy sector is expected to contribute significantly to the decarbonization of the economy.Industrial-scale production of green hydrogen will require a significant deployment ofrenewable energy technologies and we expect that wind turbine generators will play a keyrole. In addition to onshore opportunities, we expect that offshore wind turbine technologymay provide a relevant share of generation capacity required for green hydrogen production,mostly due to comparably larger project size stemming from less limitations of offshore. In thisfield, our SGRE segment is currently exploring different technological alternatives varying fromso-called “plug and play solutions” for existing wind power plants to integrated electrolyzersinside the wind turbine to produce hydrogen locally, instead of feeding electricity into thegrid. As the hydrogen technology as well as the hydrogen market are in early phases, our SGREsegment is exploring several alternatives in parallel.
12.4.2 Customers
Our SGRE segment’s customers are mainly companies that are active within the energy sector.
The main categorization of customers per activity is the following:
Utilities – companies that own projects to sell power to their distribution network to reach the
final demand of energy.
Independent Power Producers – companies that own projects in order to sell power to an
off-taker (via a power purchasing agreement) with the aim to make a financial return in excessof their cost of capital.
Project Developers – companies that develop a project to sell it to a future owner with the
interest and financial capability to build and operate it.
Others – financial investors, oil & gas players, companies that need to consume green energy in
order to meet their environmental corporate targets, self-consumers, etc. With the energytransition trends, the profiles of customers have expanded, with other players beyondtraditional players such as utilities or independent power producers gaining significantrelevance.
The scope of services offered by our SGRE segment ranges from development to full turnkey, and
there are modularized offerings for each customer segment in each business unit (Onshore,Offshore and Service). Service customers are not only those with installed SGRE wind turbines,but in some cases also with turbines from other brands (as part of the multi-brand serviceoffering; see “ 12.4.1.4.7 Multi-brand Maintenance Services ”).
Regarding strategic customers of a certain size, our SGRE segment supplies more than a dozen
global accounts as a key supplier. Some examples of such accounts are Iberdrola, ENEL, Ørstedand Equinor.
In line with widespread industry practice, SGRE typically grants warranties to its customers in
connection with repair and replacement obligations in case of component defects or functionalerrors relating to SGRE’s products during the warranty period, which generally ranges betweentwo and five years. Furthermore, SGRE’s wind turbine generators are supported by certainwarranties with respect to specific performance criteria such as noise, the power curve, or –normally if accompanied by a service contract – the availability of the turbines throughout theyear. Certain of SGRE’s service contracts include full-scope warranties for up to 30 years, whichcover not only availability, but also components, including exchange costs (such as costs forcranes and vessels).
12.4.3 Operations
12.4.3.1 Overview
Our SGRE segment operates with a flexible business model through two principal business lines:
Wind Turbines (with the business units Onshore and Offshore), which covers the design,development, manufacturing and installation of wind turbines, and Service. In a few regions,SGRE is also engaged in project development.
338
SGRE is present in more than 90 countries around the world, and its turbines are installed in
more than 70 countries. It operates more than 15 manufacturing plants in over 10 countries andhas approximately 40 sales offices (as of June 30, 2020).

(Vietnam), Kurana (Sri Lanka), Makai City (Philippines), Seoul (South Korea), Singapore(Singapore), Sydney (Australia), Taipei (Taiwan) and Tokyo (Japan), with service-only sites inAuckland (New Zealand) and Melbourne (Australia).
12.4.3.2 Manufacturing
Our SGRE segment manufactures wind turbines at its facilities in Europe, the United States, India,
Brazil, China and Morocco. Our SGRE segment has established a technical presence close to itscustomers across the world. Its manufacturing base is designed to ensure an efficient productionprocess from the design of the wind turbines to the manufacturing of all critical components.
339
Our SGRE segment operates blade factories, nacelle assembly factories and other factories (such
as gearbox, converter and cabinet factories).
The decision as to whether a specific component of a wind turbine should be produced in-house
or outsourced to third-party suppliers is determined by looking at three different dimensions:capacity, cost and local content or industrialization requirements. With information from a salesplan elaborated by the sales and marketing team for the upcoming years (split by products andgeographies), our SGRE segment defines the amount of capacity required at each location. Then,based on the above criteria, a “make or buy” decision is made.
Blade factories produce the entire blade for a wind turbine. In recent years, our SGRE segment
implemented structural shell production in all its models, which requires less infrastructure andcan be implemented more rapidly. Our SGRE segment started to implement carbon fiber inlonger blades to further reduce weight. Its industrial strategy also aims for a balance amongseveral options for manufacturing blades, including “make”, “buy” and “build-to-print” (underwhich our SGRE segment designs the blade, while the manufacturing is outsourced). Our mainblade factories are located in Fort Madison (United States), Aalborg (Denmark), Hull (UnitedKingdom), Tangier (Morocco), Nellore (India), Somozas (Spain), Lingang (China) and Vagos(Portugal; this plant was acquired in the context of the Senvion Acquisition). A new factory forwind turbine blades (as well as nacelles) is planned in Le Havre (France), with start of productionexpected for the beginning of 2022. At the end of 2019, SGRE stopped the manufacturing ofonshore blades in its Aalborg factory (the location now manufactures blades for offshoreturbines only). In addition, a decision to close the blade factory in Aoiz (Spain) due tocompetitiveness considerations was made in June 2020. This plant is specialized in small turbinemodels mainly for the Spanish market.
In addition to its own manufacturing, SGRE sources blades from third-party manufacturers
located in Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, India, China and Poland, either providing its own blade designsor using the design from the third-party manufacturer.
Nacelle assembly factories assemble the nacelle for the wind turbine. The nacelle is the structure
placed upon the tower, housing the gearbox (for onshore wind turbines), generator,transformer, electronics and other components. Attached to the nacelle is the rotor consisting ofa hub and three blades. Our SGRE segment’s main nacelle assembly factories are located inHutchinson/Kansas (United States), Camaçari (Brazil), Brande (Denmark), Cuxhaven (Germany),Ágreda (Spain), Aliaga (Turkey), Mamandur (India) and Tianjin (China). In addition, SGREsubcontracts the assembly of nacelles in Russia. New nacelle factories are under construction in LeHavre (France) and in Taichung (Taiwan) (as explained further below in more detail). SGREintends to phase out onshore-related nacelle assembly in Brande during the second half of 2020.
Tower factories produce the tower for the wind turbine. SGRE is a minority shareholder in tower
manufacturer Windar Renovables, S.L., which has factories in Spain, India, Mexico, Brazil andRussia.
Generator factories produce the generator transforming the rotation energy to electricity. Our
SGRE segment’s generator factories are located in Reinosa (Spain), Camaçari (Brazil) and Tianjin(China). In addition, direct drive generators are assembled in Brande (Denmark) and Cuxhaven(Germany).
Our SGRE segment operates gearbox plants in Spain, with the main factories located in Lerma
and Sigüeiro. A gearbox is typically used in a wind turbine to increase rotational speed from alow-speed rotor to a higher speed electrical generator.
Our SGRE segment’s converter factories are located in Madrid (Spain), Valencia (Spain) and
Tianjin (China). Converters enable the management of the electrical output of the wind turbineto optimize it following grid requirements. Our SGRE segment produces converters for wind andsolar applications.
In addition, our SGRE segment operates cabinets factories in Valencia (Spain) and Tianjin (China).
A control cabinet monitors certain parameters of a wind turbine in order to operate the turbine
340
in the most efficient way. Depending on the direction and the speed of the wind, the position of
the nacelle and the blades are modified to maximize production, as well as to control the loadstransmitted by the wind through the rest of the wind turbine.
With respect to the newly-acquired onshore blade manufacturing plant in Vagos (Portugal), we
expect that this plant will help to strengthen our SGRE segment’s industrial value chain andreduce dependency on supplier sourcing from Asia. The plant can produce more than 1,300blades per year. In addition, the facility is complementary to existing SGRE blade capacities and isexpected to support international sales. Its location and logistics are suitable to source theEuropean markets, allowing for significant cost optimization and mitigating supply chain risks.
In addition, our SGRE segment is currently building a new nacelle assembly facility for the
offshore business in Taiwan, at a site located in the port of Taichung. It will be our SGREsegment’s first offshore nacelle assembly plant outside of Europe. The plant allows SGRE to fulfilllocal content requirements. Moreover, in May 2020, SGRE started an expansion plan for itsnacelle assembly facility in Taichung, to form a regional offshore wind nacelle industrial hubtogether with Taiwan-based suppliers. The expansion, which is subject to certain conditions, isplanned to start after the nacelle assembly work is completed in 2022. The first project to besupported by the broader manufacturing plant will be the 300 MW Hai Long 2 project (withnacelle production for the project scheduled to begin in 2024 and turbine installation is expectedto follow thereafter). SGRE is also building a new nacelle and blade manufacturing plant in LeHavre (France). Among others, blades and nacelles for the wind turbines to be supplied for twolarge French offshore projects totaling almost 1 GW are planned to be manufactured at this newplant. Furthermore, our SGRE segment is considering to use its existing Nellore facility in Indiaalso for the production of converters and cabinets in the near future.
Our SGRE segment has implemented innovative logistical set-ups, for example with its plant for
offshore nacelles in Cuxhaven, Germany, which represented an investment of approximately€200 million. This new set-up for offshore markets uses two purpose-built transport vessels.
Large turbine components are rolled on and off these vessels (for example, to transport them totheir offshore wind power plant location) rather than being loaded by crane. The Cuxhaven plantproduces SGRE’s SG 8.0-167 DD offshore wind turbine model.
In the first half of 2020, SGRE initiated a restructuring of Indian operations to take account of the
slower-than-expected recovery of the Indian wind market and in order to adapt to new marketprospects and dynamics. Our SGRE segment is continuously monitoring its footprint, including asrelated to its manufacturing plants, to adapt its presence and activities to changing marketdynamics. This may lead to the announcement of the opening of selected new sites or furtherfootprint adjustments of certain operations of SGRE in the near future.
12.4.3.3 Procurement
Our SGRE segment operates with a large supplier and contractor base, and had approximately
18,000 tier-1 suppliers with procurement volumes of approximately €8 billion in the fiscal year
2019. The number of tier-1 suppliers was reduced during the fiscal year 2020.
Our SGRE segment is continuously working on diversifying the risk in the supply chain by working
with multiple suppliers globally and striving to reduce the volume of sourcing from singlesuppliers. Our SGRE segment is leveraging partnerships with selected key suppliers in particularfor gearboxes, bearings, transformers and blades, with the aim of further enhancing itstechnology and innovation capabilities and its technology position in the market. Other relevantmaterials include hydraulic systems, power controls, steel parts and fabrications, casting,composite materials, tower conversion, resins and structural adhesive.
SGRE has entered into supply agreements with Siemens Energy mainly relating to the
procurement of electrical components as well as various procurement agreements with SiemensGroup companies relating to (i) certain supplies used in SGRE’s manufacturing process and otheroperations, and (ii) the provision by Siemens AG of certain procurement services for SGRE,enabling SGRE to benefit from a greater collective bargaining power. For more information, see
341
“18.1.1.2 Relationships with and Services Provided by the Siemens Group to SGRE ” and
“18.1.2.4.6 Transactions between the Siemens Group and SGRE ”. The award system is designed to
ensure that supplies are carried out under market conditions, as well as to enable theparticipation of other suppliers.
As part of the necessary increase in purchasing volume due to the growth and its need for global
supplies, our SGRE segment is striving to strike a balance between local content requirementsand the global supply chain.
Our SGRE segment has a specific supplier relationship policy in place, which provides a group-
wide framework for management and control of procurement activities. The aim is to ensure theimpartiality, transparency and objectivity of its supplier selection processes; the policy alsoestablishes the channels and mechanisms needed to ensure that suppliers’ conduct is ethical. Oneof these mechanisms is the P2P (“purchase to pay”) process implemented in order to reduce risksin the purchasing process and to ensure a strict adherence and compliance throughout theprocess, avoiding misconduct and fraud along the whole supply chain.
Overall, the activities of the supply chain support are guided by principles such as the
development of the local supply base while contributing to local wealth creation, working withsuppliers to achieve high-quality component design in order to reduce costs and creatingopportunities for qualified suppliers to export to other regions based on their competitiveness.These are contemplated in internal activities regarding, for example, commodity strategies andnew product introduction, and by its supplier life cycle management team. For instance,sustainability self-assessments are applied to strategic suppliers or suppliers located in high-riskcountries. Furthermore, an external sustainability audit is carried out by different third-partyproviders to detect any non-compliance.
Our SGRE segment’s code of conduct for suppliers and third-party intermediaries, released in
2018, is included in the general purchasing conditions, framework contracts and purchaseagreements with each supplier, and is also included in procurement tools to ensure compliance.In 2019, SGRE released a booklet with its code of conduct for suppliers and third-partyintermediaries which documents in detail its expectations towards its suppliers. Furthermore,SGRE has a supplier quality manual in place which deals with health, safety and environmentalguidelines, as well as quality requirements for the qualification of suppliers, components andservices.
SGRE also monitors critical suppliers (defined according to parameters such as a purchasing
volume over €50,000 or operating or being based in a high-risk country from a corporate
responsibility perspective) and keeps track of high sustainability risk suppliers which it identifiesaccording to pre-defined criteria, e.g., relating to incidents of compliance misconduct.
12.4.3.4 Product Design and Life Cycle
The product life cycle process within our SGRE segment follows a detailed, multidisciplinary plan
for the development of products, which is coordinated by the product portfolio managementorganization within SGRE, receiving input from cross-functional teams. The process includes ananalysis of customer requirements, EHS regulations, industrialization requirements, supply chainrestrictions and operations track record. After the conceptual design and the functionaldefinition, the detailed product design is carried out, including prototype testing and verificationof the identified requirements as well as product validation and risk analysis. Thereafter, theproduct moves to the industrialization phase. Once delivered and commissioned, the product isoperated and maintained by the Services business unit, and is optimized through continuousproduct improvement. In addition, after-sales activities, such as field upgrades, refurbishments,retrofits and add-on features can be offered to customers.
12.4.3.5 Sales and Marketing
Our SGRE segment markets its products through a global sales force with local offices in almost
40 countries and in every region in order to ensure customer proximity. The main sales offices are
342
located in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Spain, Denmark, Germany, India and China. Our
SGRE segment’s sales force is responsible for the identification of sales opportunities and theirmanagement, technical support, order processing and day-to-day contact with customers. Inaddition, our SGRE segment is introducing focused market strategies tailored to different typesof customers.
Our SGRE segment’s staff in sales and marketing functions comprised approximately 1,600
employees as of September 30, 2019 worldwide. The compensation of the sales force is partlyperformance-based. Marketing is organized to cover the three business units Onshore, Offshoreand Service and their respective sales regions, with nearly 40 local sales offices and teams presentaround the globe. Certain functions, notably our SGRE segment’s global brand strategy andmarketing communications, are managed by the Corporate Affairs unit, which defines a uniformappearance and corporate design of all publications and advertising materials throughout itsorganization. To support a corporate identity at the level of our SGRE segment, this central unitalso defines the brand strategy with respect to all brands used by our SGRE segment, developsmarketing concepts and carries out part of their implementation alongside marketing teams witheach of the business units. SGRE’s sales model is generally based on direct sales, with theexception of the offshore business in China, where currently a license model through acooperation with Shanghai Electric is used. For more information, see “ 12.4.5 IP Rights ”.
12.4.3.6 Project Development and Execution
Our SGRE segment executes projects worldwide and offers engineering, procurement, execution,
project management, financing support and after-sales services, among others. Depending onmarket requirements as well as SGRE’s regional or project-specific approach, the scope of SGRE’sinvolvement may include undertaking a full EPC scope or wind power plant developmentactivities in some cases.
By the end of the fiscal year 2019, SGRE had installed, in the aggregate, nearly 16 GW of onshore
wind power plants with an EPC scope and had further projects with EPC scope under constructionof more than 1.6 GW. For example, for the West Bakr wind project in Egypt, our SGRE segmentwill install 96 SG 2.6-114 onshore turbines through a turnkey EPC contract and will provide long-term maintenance for a 15-year service term. All civil and most electrical and logistical work willbe handled by local subcontractors and all the turbine towers will be produced in Egypt. Theproject will increase the country’s installed wind energy capacity by 18% up to 1,650 MW.
In offshore wind, SGRE is the industry leader (see “ 11.5.4.2 Competitive Environment in the
Offshore New Unit Market Segment ”) and has successfully executed a project pipeline of nearly
16 GW (mostly without extended or EPC scope) by the end of June 2020. A recent example thathighlights this excellence in project management and execution is in the successful delivery ofthe world’s largest offshore wind power plant commissioned to date, Hornsea One (source:Ørsted’s website for the project, hornseaprojectone.co.uk, section “About the project”), off thecoast of Yorkshire in the North Sea, which was completed on time, in budget and within qualitytargets in 2019. In the Hornsea ONE project, 174 SGRE SWT-7.0 MW turbines were installed,which represented a significant logistical and manufacturing undertaking. During the installationphase, SGRE was able to further demonstrate its innovation and market-leading experience withindividual wind turbines being installed and commissioned in less than 24 hours each and over98% availability from the first day of operation of the project (according to our monitoring datafor the project). Project management excellence, highly skilled passionate employees, closecollaboration with customers and over nearly 30 years of offshore experience enable SGRE tomaintain its leadership in international offshore markets.
Together with its partners, our SGRE segment also supports customers to develop tailored
financing solutions to address their specific requirements. For example, for the No. 5 Thanh Hai 1nearshore wind power plant in Vietnam, SGRE coordinated the discussions with the financingparties, which includes the Danish Export Credit Agency, an international bank and one ofVietnam’s largest banks, to offer its customer a highly bankable and competitive debt package.Furthermore, through the preferred financing agreement between SGRE S.A. and Siemens AG
343
(for more information, see “ 18.1.1.2.3(1) Preferred Financing Agreement SGRE ”), SGRE can also
provide solutions regarding equity financing as well as debt and commercial finance for projectsvia SFS.
In 2020, SGRE introduced a project management framework for the Onshore business unit. This
framework – “PM@SGRE” – has the goal to improve project management efficiency andeffectiveness. A dedicated project has been set up to accelerate the harmonization and consistentimplementation of this framework into the operational business across the three business unitsOnshore, Offshore and Service.
In addition, in some countries SGRE also assumes exposure to development activities.
Traditionally, this has been the case in India, where in most of the projects SGRE had exposure todevelopment activities. Outside India, the exposure to development activities is more limited (inthe fiscal year 2019, SGRE’s development activities based on installed capacity representedapproximately 5% of the total volume installed outside India). With the implementation of theLEAP program, and the restructuring in India, our SGRE segment is planning to have a moreselective approach to project development to reduce exposure to associated risks. For example,full own development is intended to be more limited, and development terms are beingadjusted. Our SGRE segment will continuously review its development assets and differentoptions regarding such assets.
12.4.3.7 Information Technology
The IT function at our SGRE segment provides cybersecurity, IT application and infrastructure
services to run enterprise replenishment processes, innovate and design products while managingtheir life cycle, enable a holistic view of customers (including aspects such as marketing, sales,project execution and services), operate factories, sites and distribution centers, and manage thesupply chain. Furthermore, the IT function provides IT application and infrastructure services toits corporate functions to support finance (including business planning, controlling, treasury andconsolidation), human resources management, security and facility management,communications, audit and compliance operations, including allowing for uniform and timelyreporting. IT infrastructure services have been operated by a neutral carrier vendor (Infosys) since2019 and managed by a global service management function.
The IT organization has a clear focus on cybersecurity, digitalization, standardization and
harmonization of processes and applications. Our SGRE segment sees information and the assetsit supports as strategic assets for the business, for which reason it has control systems in place toensure the protection thereof in terms of availability, confidentiality, integrity, authenticationand traceability. Our SGRE segment’s IT processes include, among others, (i) back-ups, by way ofduplication of critical infrastructures and regular production of back-up copies of information inseparate physical locations, and a policy for review and control of the integrity of the copiesmade; (ii) security of physical access to the data processing center and of software access(including access restrictions, encryption of sensitive information and analysis of identifiedsecurity incidents, among others); (iii) controls relating to the maintenance and implementationof computer applications, implementation and migrations plans, risk management via separateenvironments for operation and tests and simulation and other measures. SGRE has anoperational cybersecurity application in place.
Since the foundation of SGRE in its current set-up, back in 2017, SGRE is driving a transformation
based on stand-alone company IT applications, tools and infrastructure. In parallel, a clear focushas been set on the gradual reduction of transitional service agreements agreed between SGREand Siemens at the time of the merger (with a maximum term of four years), with the aim ofsupporting both governance and operational independence from Siemens. In this connection,among other initiatives, SGRE has developed internal capacities or outsourced certain functionsto specialized third-party providers in several key functional areas. In 2019, our SGRE segmentexpanded its digital team working on the digital transformation of wind energy. This team hasover 150 people in a Digital Ventures Lab set up to search for new developments as well as globalremote diagnostic centers that convert big data into value for customers.

12.4.4 R&D
Wind turbines developed and manufactured by our SGRE segment are in permanent evolution,
incorporating the latest technological advances with the aim of increasing both power andperformance. Overall, our SGRE segment employs approximately 2,000 dedicated R&D staffaround the world (as of September 30, 2019). In the fiscal years 2017 through 2019, R&D activitieswere focused, in particular, on the development of new wind turbine models, software and theoptimization of the components’ performance. The SGRE segment’s research and developmentexpenses amounted to €208 million, €166 million and €189 million in the fiscal years 2019,
2018 and 2017, respectively. Furthermore, the SGRE segment showed additions to otherintangible assets of €160 million, €129 million and €76 million in the fiscal years 2019, 2018
and 2017, respectively, which largely relate to capitalized research and development expenses.The periods presented did not include any amortization of intangible assets acquired in businesscombinations and goodwill impairments for SGRE. In the fiscal year 2019, SGRE invested broadlythe same amount as capitalized development costs, which are shown as additions to otherintangible assets.
Our SGRE segment’s R&D activities are carried out mainly through seven technology centers
located in Bangalore (India), Boulder (United States), Brande (Denmark), Hamburg (Germany),Zamudio, Madrid and Pamplona (all in Spain). The R&D activities Brande, Bilbao and Pamplonaare focused on the nacelle and its components. The facilities in Madrid and Brande are equippedwith test benches for testing and validating software systems for wind power, PV, energy storageand hybrid power systems. The Bangalore center serves global engineering and technologydemands pertaining to software and design engineering for onshore and offshore wind turbines,with a focus on new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, requiredfor building “smart” wind turbines of the next generation.
Technological development at our SGRE segment is established within a multi-year framework
that is rolled out in the annual technological development plan, where activities and deliverablesare established for each year and to which a budget is assigned.
SGRE also cooperates with renowned specialized institutions in the field of wind energy and
fosters research partnerships across countries, organizations and disciplines. In addition, SGRE’spartnership with Ørsted and the three U.K. universities of Hull, Sheffield and Durham is alsolooking at how renewable energy research can lower the costs of offshore wind power. This five-year partnership funded by the U.K. government under its Engineering and Physical ScienceResearch Council enables SGRE and its partner to develop new solutions relating to structuralhealth monitoring and generator topologies. SGRE is also collaborating with Siemens in thedevelopment of thermal energy storage in a project called “ETES” that is co-funded by theGerman Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs of Energy. Within the digitalization field, our SGREsegment is cooperating with the University of Carlos III in Madrid in a three-year project, fundedby the Spanish institution “ Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnológico Industrial ” (CDTI). The project
comprises research on edge computing technologies, probabilistic design and power plantcontrol technologies, while looking for synergetic solutions with other sectors’ needs andsolutions. Furthermore, our SGRE segment regularly showcases some of its innovations atexhibitions and trade fairs in the wind energy industry.
12.4.5 IP Rights
Our SGRE segment’s IP strategy aims to protect and enhance its competitive position in the
various geographic locations in which it operates. This is achieved by effective management of itsIP rights, including patents, utility models, trademarks and know-how. IP rights are mainlymanaged and coordinated by IP teams based in Denmark, Germany and Spain, which have accessto the relevant information within the SGRE group companies. IP rights are held centrally by twoSGRE group companies in Denmark and Spain.
On March 31, 2017, SGRE S.A. and Siemens AG entered into a licensing agreement pursuant to
which SGRE S.A. was entitled to use the “Siemens” brand subject to certain conditions, includinga change-of-control provision. This licensing agreement shall be replaced upon the loss of control
345
of Siemens AG in SGRE S.A. (which will be the case upon Spin-Off Completion) by another
licensing agreement signed between SGRE S.A. and Siemens AG on May 20, 2020. In addition, onJanuary 1, 2019, SGRE and Siemens entered into a service agreement by which Siemens providessupport regarding the administration of IP rights. For more information on these agreements, see“18.1.1.2 Relationships with and Services Provided by the Siemens Group to SGRE ”.
SGRE has also entered into licensing agreements with its partner Shanghai Electric that cover
SGRE’s 4.0 MW, 6.0 MW, 7.0 MW and 8.0 MW offshore wind turbine technology. Under suchagreements, Shanghai Electric manufactures, sells and installs the offshore turbines for theoffshore wind power projects in mainland China’s territorial waters against payment of a licensefee. The strategic cooperation between SGRE and Shanghai Electric started in 2013 when theyjoined efforts to drive the development of the Chinese offshore wind power market.
SGRE also owns several trademarks, in particular world trademarks and product trademarks, for
example DinoTails
®, HWRT (High Wind Ride Through) and IntegralBlade®.
As part of the Senvion acquisition, SGRE acquired all of Senvion’s IP rights, including patents,
trademarks, software and know-how related to the acquired business, with the exception of IPrights registered in India (see also “ 12.9.3 Acquisition of Selected European Assets of Senvion ”).
In addition, it is particularly important to our SGRE segment to protect the results of its
innovation activities with regard to new product developments and business fields againstunauthorized use. Throughout its history, SGRE has patented a large number of innovations,including products, methods and processes. Our SGRE segment’s patent portfolio includes anextensive number of patents that are necessary for its business activities, which it obtains byexercising its rights regarding employee inventions and submitting them for registration. SGREheld over 5,800 active patents as of June 30, 2020 (this figure contemplates, among others, over2,200 active patents acquired from Senvion under the Senvion Acquisition). Patents include utilitymodels in Denmark, Spain, Germany and other jurisdictions as well, among them a few patentsand utility models registered for foreign SGRE companies in foreign jurisdictions only. However,with respect to trade secrets and specific secret process technologies, our SGRE segmentsometimes elects not to pursue protection through patent registration, as this would require thedisclosure of secret know-how. For a description of certain SGRE disputes relating to IP rights, see“12.8.2.4 Disputes or Disagreements Regarding IP Rights ”.
12.4.6 Sustainability, Environmental, Social Responsibility and Governance
SGRE voluntarily adheres to various codes of ethics or codes of practice, including (i) “United
Nations Global Compact”, which is promoted by the United Nations (“ UN”) with the goal of
promoting commitment and support of the ten principles related to human and labor rights,environmental protection and the fight against corruption, (ii) the Global Reporting Initiative, anindependent international organization that has pioneered sustainability reporting, relating tothe exchange of transparent and reliable information on sustainability, (iii) the Science BasedTargets, a joint international initiative of the Carbon Disclosure Project, the UN Global Compact,the World Resources Institute, the World Wide Fund for Nature and the We Mean Businesscoalition with the aim of reducing carbon emissions in a measurable manner and to a sufficientlevel to meet the objective of not exceeding 2ºC of global warming established in the ParisAgreement, and many other initiatives relating to diversity, sustainability, climate change andsimilar topics. In December 2019, SGRE signed the “Business Ambition for 1.5C – Our OnlyFuture” pledge during the climate change talks held in Madrid, committing to meet objectivesrelating to its emissions evaluated through the UN’s SBTI, or by setting a public goal to reachnet-zero emissions by no later than 2050 (source: SGRE website, Journal section, “SiemensGamesa reaffirms pledge to meet UN’s climate targets for Industry”, published on December 11,2019). As of August 24, 2020, there were 274 companies that had committed to this initiative(source: UN Global Compact website, “Take action” section, “Business Ambition for 1.5 C – Jointhe visionary corporate leaders”). SGRE is a member of various international sustainabilityindexes, such as Dow Jones Sustainability Indices of the S&P Dow Jones Indices, which are float-adjusted market capitalization weighted indices that measure the performance of selected
346
companies with respect to economic, environmental and social criteria using a best-in-class
approach; the FTSE4Good Index series of the Financial Times Stock Exchange Index, the EthibelSustainability Index, the STOXX
®Euro Sustainability and the Global Challenges Index. In 2020,
SGRE received an A rating (on a scale of AAA-CCC), an upgrade from its former BB rating, in theMSCI ESG ratings assessment, enabling SGRE’s inclusion in the MSCI indices and with aninvestment grade rating. The MSCI ESG ratings measure companies, according to exposure toindustry-specific ESG risks and the ability to manage those risks.
In addition, SGRE has identified several strategic lines and actions to work on regarding
corporate social responsibility (“ CSR”), which are set forth in its 2018-2020 CSR strategy,
including pillars such as integrity and transparency, green development and a responsible supplychain, among others, as well as specific targets, actions and compliance control frameworks foreach of the pillars.
An example of SGRE’s commitment to sustainable development is the amount of guarantees that
qualify as “green” which added up to €1.77 billion by the end of 2019. Guarantee lines are
considered “green” when they are linked to transactions that contribute to the UN’s SDGs, i.e.,
transactions focused on environmentally friendly, social or sustainable deals. For moreinformation, see “ 12.9.2 Certain SGRE Financing Agreements ”.
With nearly 100 GW of installed wind capacity as of September 30, 2019, SGRE contributes to
cutting emissions of CO
2by 259 million tons per year (data for the fiscal year 2019; based on the
calculation of total CO2emissions that would be generated annually with conventional fossil
fuels to produce the equivalent amount of electricity, in kWh, produced by SGRE turbines on anannual basis), roughly equivalent to planting 4 billion trees or removing the emissions of170 million diesel cars (as per its own internal assessment based on the 2006 IPCC NationalGreenhouse Gas Inventories). SGRE had undertaken to be carbon-neutral by 2025, by usingoffsetting measures while working consistently to reduce all carbon emissions across itsoperations, replacing conventional emission-intensive power sources with renewable energies. Inthe second quarter of the fiscal year 2020, SGRE communicated that it had achieved carbonneutrality (including through offsetting) ahead of its 2025 target timeframe. SGRE will continueto transition its electricity supply from renewable sources. A significant share of SGRE locations inDenmark, Germany and Spain are already supplied with renewable energy. Currently, this isachieved through the purchase of green renewable certificates that guarantee that the electricityhas been generated by a renewable energy source. SGRE has stated that it will also investigatethe feasibility of implementing renewable energy generating technologies at facility or projectsites in the future. In addition, SGRE has defined a sustainable mobility plan (the “GlobalMobility & Transportation Policy Framework”) which includes a decreasing set of limits regardingCO
2for management fleet with different milestones to be achieved as from October 1, 2019,
2020 and 2021, respectively. SGRE is currently implementing this framework, which willcontribute to SGRE’s objectives regarding its (indirect) GHG emissions. In addition, SGRE islooking into the cost and feasibility of replacing part of the existing company vehicle fleet with,for example, plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles, which will support SGRE in its reduction of (direct)GHG emissions. Furthermore, SGRE has one wind power project registered as a CleanDevelopment Mechanism (“ CDM ”) under the United Nations standards (UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change). This project generates Certified Emission Reductions (“ CER”)
that are used to offset GHG emissions. The project is in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico and iscurrently in operation. A decision has yet to be taken on the different deadlines and scenarios toexchange the CERs available for use and subsequently deleted from the CDM register to offsetSGRE’s GHG emissions in keeping with its climate neutral strategy.
SGRE also uses several regulatory and voluntary instruments to achieve a positive net balance in
relation to biodiversity and the environment. These include company policies and procedure, fullcompliance with permits granted by environmental and conservation authorities in each region(which set out requirements to ensure the local environment’s protection), setting environmentaland control plans and implementing management systems (the majority of which have beencertified according to the ISO 14001 standard to prevent and control environmental risks), andcomplying with regulations on conducting environmental impact studies (which include analysis
347
and prevention mechanisms with different alternatives and lay down corrective measures to
avoid, mitigate or offset any possible damage to biodiversity and the environment).
SGRE pursues a life cycle approach so that its wind turbines not only provide clean energy during
operation but are also resource-efficient and recyclable. SGRE’s most significant efforts in thisarea include, among others, reducing materials, waste, energy and water, optimizing packagingand logistics, improving the turbines’ capacity factor for higher AEP, reducing time betweenservice visits for less fuel consumption, applying remote diagnostics to increase availability,protecting wildlife by using SCADA control, a modular design to optimize dismantling and wastetreatment, reusing and recycling components and materials and seeking alternative materials forhigh recyclability.
In addition, SGRE has undertaken in its code of conduct (the “Business Conduct Guidelines”
issued in 2018) to defend human rights. SGRE is committed to observing international standardson the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the people affected by its operations,guided by the UN Norms on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and OtherBusiness Enterprises with regard to human rights, the guidelines of the OECD, the TripartiteDeclaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy of theInternational Labor Organization and the Women’s Empowerment Principles of the UNDevelopment Fund for Women (UNIFEM). In 2020, SGRE was included in Bloomberg’s Gender-Equality Index.
Moreover, in early April 2020, SGRE joined the IRENA Coalition for Action alongside over 100
leading renewable energy players calling for the sector to be at the core in leading a sustainablerecovery from the coronavirus crisis. In May 2020, SGRE joined an expanded group of 270executives from major European companies and banks, EU politicians and industry bodies to havesigned up to the EU’s Green Recovery Alliance that aims to drive a sustainable recovery path inthe wake of the coronavirus crisis. The Alliance has committed among its signatories to worktogether, share knowledge, and create synergies needed to deliver the investment decisionsrequired for a green recovery.
12.4.7 Compliance
SGRE’s compliance system is based on three pillars, namely (i) prevention (including effective
preventive measures such as risk management, policies and procedures, training andcommunication to enable systematic misconduct to be avoided), (ii) detection (includingcomplete clarification through initiatives such as whistle-blowing channels as well as professionaland fair investigations) and (iii) response (including explicit consequences and clear reactions tosupport the prevention of misconduct and eliminate deficiencies).
SGRE’s compliance organization comprises different levels, headed by the Chief Compliance
Officer, an internal independent and permanent figure who reports to the Audit, Complianceand Related Party Transactions Committee of the board of directors as well as to the ExecutiveCommittee. The internal audit department is responsible for adapting internal control systemsand examines the compliance organization. When requested by the Chief Compliance Officer,the internal audit department also conducts reviews on certain compliance regulations andprocesses up to a complete check of the compliance system. The compliance department overseesthe prevention supervision of the ethics culture and the creation thereof. Overall responsibilityfor compliance lies with the management of SGRE and the managing directors/heads of theindividual SGRE units. The board of directors is ultimately responsible for compliance withinSGRE. Its Audit, Compliance and Related Party Transactions Committee supervises the reviewingof the compliance system’s efficiency, including proposing the compliance organization’s budget.The compliance organization is supported by several compliance officers who are responsible forimplementing the compliance systems in the regions and countries in which SGRE operates.
SGRE’s Business Conduct Guidelines lay the foundation for its internal regulations and express
SGRE’s values, compliance-related responsibilities and behavioral framework for all managers,employees and managing board members worldwide. SGRE has developed and implemented acompliance system as the basis for all its decisions and activities, focused on strictly complying
348
with all laws and internal regulations as well as principles of ethical business conduct. Training, in
particular of employees who, by their functions, are exposed to specific compliance risks, is animportant element of SGRE’s compliance system. In addition, a compliance risk assessmentevaluates these risks and defines mitigation measures. It also creates an awareness of compliancerisks, strengthens cooperation between the compliance organization and the operational unitsand emphasizes the responsibility of the managing directors and management in general forcompliance-related topics. Moreover, a Clearing Committee has been set up to assess the risksresulting from disclosure of information and documents by SGRE to law enforcement or othergovernmental agencies.
For risks related to the failing of our compliance system, see “ 3.4.4 Our risk management and
internal controls may not prevent or detect compliance risks, which could result in investigationsby authorities, fines, damage claims, payment claims, the termination of relationships withcustomers or suppliers and even governmental exclusion from businesses (blacklisting) as well asreputational damage. Further, our internal controls could fail to detect business risks in time orat all. ”.
12.4.8 Insurance
SGRE’s insurance policies are aimed at adequately covering its property, plant and equipment.
SGRE has also entered into insurance policies to cover the wind turbines generators while theyare being assembled. Effective as of October 1, 2019, SGRE adhered to a global stand-aloneinsurance program, which includes all-risk property damage insurance policies, civil liabilityinsurance policies, transport, chartering of ships and all-risk construction insurance policies.Marsh and McLennan acts as insurance broker and service provider for the global insuranceprogram. In addition, SGRE S.A. has entered into D&O insurance policies as well as death anddisability insurance, among others, for executives, directors and other employees. As of the dateof this Prospectus, SGRE has no material insurance claim.
12.4.9 Ratings
SGRE has received ratings from several rating agencies. The following provides an overview of
the current ratings as of the date of the Prospectus and of the definitions used by the respectiverating agencies:
Rating Agency Long-Term Rating OutlookDate of
Assessment
S&P Global Ratings
Europe Limited (“ S&P
Global ” ).............. BBB- Positive July 2, 2020
Moody’s Investors Service
España S.A.(“Moody’s ” ) .......... Baa3Under review for
downgrade June 23, 2020
Fitch Ratings España S.A.U
(“Fitch ” ) ............. B B B Negative May 12, 2020
Based on the latest S&P Global publication of July 2, 2020, the SGRE rating is foreseen to be
upgraded to BBB once the Spin-Off is completed. S&P Global has indicated in such publicationthat it will equalize the issuer credit rating on SGRE with that on Siemens Energy once SiemensEnergy’s ratings are final.
According to Moody’s methodology, a decision relating to the review for a potential downgrade
shall be made within the three months following the publication of the review notice onJune 23, 2020. The process is ongoing and Moody’s shall publish the result on or beforeSeptember 23, 2020.
The rating agencies define the ratings as follows:S&P Global: According to the definition used by Standard & Poor’s, an obligor rated “BBB”
has adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments. However, adverse economic
349
conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to weaken the obligor’s capacity
to meet its financial commitments. Ratings can be modified by the addition of a plus(+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing position within the rating categories. Apositive outlook means that a rating may be raised over the intermediate term.
Moody’s: According to the definition used by Moody’s, obligations rated “Baa” are judged to
be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certainspeculative characteristics. Moody’s appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to eachgeneric rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in thehigher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-rangeranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic ratingcategory.
A review indicates that a rating is under consideration for a change in the near term.
A rating can be placed on review for upgrade, downgrade, or more rarely withdirection uncertain. A review may end with a rating being upgraded, downgraded, orconfirmed without a change to the rating. Ratings are placed on review when a ratingaction may be warranted in the near term but further information or analysis isneeded to reach a decision on the need for a rating change or the magnitude of thepotential change. The time between the origination of a rating review and itsconclusion varies widely depending on the reason for the review and the amount oftime needed to obtain and analyze the information relevant to make a ratingdetermination. In some cases, the ability to conclude a review is dependent onwhether a specific event occurs, such as the completion of a corporate merger or theexecution of an amendment to a structured finance security. For the majority ofreviews, however, where the conclusion of the review is not dependent on an eventwhose timing Moody’s cannot control, reviews are typically concluded within 30 to 90days. Ratings on review for possible downgrade (upgrade) have historically concludedwith a downgrade (upgrade) over half of the time.
Fitch: According to Fitch, a “BBB” rating indicates a good credit quality, i.e., that
expectations of default risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of financialcommitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions aremore likely to impair this capacity. The outlook indicates the direction a rating ispossible to move over a one to two-year period.
Each of S&P Global, Moody’s and Fitch are registered with ESMA in accordance with Regulation
(EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on creditrating agencies, as amended from time to time, and are included in the list of registered creditrating agencies published on the website of the European Securities and Markets Authority(https://www.esma.europa.eu/supervision/credit-rating-agencies/risk).
Each rating reflects the opinion of the particular rating agency at the given reported point in
time. Investors should consider each rating individually and obtain additional information and amore detailed understanding of the significance of the credit rating provided by the relevantrating agency. Rating agencies may change their ratings at any time if they are of the opinionthat specific circumstances require such a change. Investors should not regard the long-termratings as a recommendation to buy, hold or sell securities.

12.7 Risk Management and Compliance
We continuously seek to reduce various risks to which we are exposed, including the risk thatemployees as well as representatives, consultants and business partners of Siemens Energy mayengage in illegal business practices. The aim of our risk management is to ensure the risksassociated with our business activities are in reasonable relation to the opportunities pursued,while the aim of our compliance system is to prevent, detect and respond to potential violationsof applicable rules and regulations. As part of the Siemens Group, our Gas and Power segmentwas integrated into the Siemens Group’s risk management and compliance systems. Inpreparation for our separation from Siemens, we have established our own risk management andcompliance organizations, functions, tools and processes, the key features of which are based onthe systems developed by Siemens.
For risks related to the failing of our risk management and compliance system, see “ 3.4.4 Our risk
management and internal controls may not prevent or detect compliance risks, which couldresult in investigations by authorities, fines, damage claims, payment claims, the termination ofrelationships with customers or suppliers and even governmental exclusion from businesses(blacklisting) as well as reputational damage. Further, our internal controls could fail to detectbusiness risks in time or at all. ”.
12.7.1 Risk Management
Our risk management policy stems from a philosophy of creating economic value while managing
appropriate risks and opportunities and avoiding inappropriate risks. As risk management is anintegral part of how we plan and execute our business strategies, our group-wide riskmanagement policy is set by the Executive Board. Our organizational and accountability structurerequires each of the respective managements of our organizational units to implement riskmanagement programs that are tailored to their specific industries and responsibilities, whilebeing consistent with group-wide policies of the Executive Board.
Risk management at Siemens Energy builds on a comprehensive, interactive and management-
oriented Enterprise Risk Management (“ ERM ”) approach that is integrated into the organization
352
and that addresses both risks and opportunities. Our ERM process aims for early identification,
evaluation and response to risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievementof our strategic, operational, financial and compliance objectives. The time horizon is typicallythree years, and we take a net risk approach, addressing risks and opportunities remaining afterthe execution of existing control measures. Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacyand effectiveness of our risk management. The processes and procedures implemented areintended to help ensure that the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are fully informedabout significant risks in a timely manner.
If risks have already been considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the consolidated financial
statements ( e.g., as a provision or risk contingency), they are supposed to be incorporated with
their financial impact in the entity’s business objectives. As a consequence, only additional risksarising from the same subject ( e.g., deviations from business objectives, different impact
perspectives) should be considered. In order to provide a comprehensive view of our businessactivities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way combining elements of bothtop down and bottom-up approaches.
Reporting generally follows periodic cycles but we complement this periodic reporting with an
ad-hoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risksand opportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, considering differentperspectives, including business objectives, reputation and regulatory requirements. If new risksare identified the respective managements of our organizational units will become involved todecide whether such risks shall be tracked in future risk reporting. Responsibilities are assignedfor all relevant risks and opportunities, with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending onthe significance of the respective risk or opportunity. Our general response strategies withrespect to risks are avoidance, transfer, reduction or acceptance of the relevant risk.
To oversee the ERM process and further drive integration and harmonization of existing control
activities to align with legal and operational requirements, the Executive Board established a RiskManagement and Internal Control Organization, headed by the Chief Risk and Internal ControlOfficer. In order to allow for a meaningful discussion of risk at the group level, this organizationaggregates individual risks and opportunities of similar cause-and-effect nature into broader riskand opportunity themes. The Chief Risk and Internal Control Officer reports periodically to theExecutive Board on matters relating to the implementation, operation and oversight of the riskand internal control system and assists the Executive Board, for example, in reporting to theAudit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
12.7.2 Compliance
At Siemens Energy we pursue a zero tolerance approach to corruption and other violations of
applicable law and our business conduct guidelines (“ BCGs ”). Our compliance system is designed
to anchor integrity and compliance in the minds and actions of all Siemens Energy employees andexternal stakeholders. For this purpose, we conduct integrity dialogues and compliance trainingworldwide. Our BCGs form the basis for detailed internal regulations. The BCGs are binding forall Siemens Energy employees worldwide.
Our compliance system is designed to ensure that our business practices worldwide comply with
these guidelines and with applicable laws. To this end and to protect against compliance risks,our compliance system is based on the three pillars of prevention, detection and response, andcovers in particular the areas of anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, antitrust, data privacy,export control and human rights. We also require our suppliers and business partners to complywith our standards of business conduct, including those relating to anti-corruption and faircompetition.
The global compliance structure combines strong governance at group level with the use of
qualified compliance officers who ensure that the compliance system is implemented worldwide.Since the corruption scandal at Siemens AG in 2007/2008, a clear and unambiguous message hasbeen constantly conveyed that every single employee and especially management must comply
353
with the compliance rules. This message applies equally to the employees and management of
Siemens Energy.
At Siemens Energy, a reliable compliance risk analysis is key to the success of the corporate
strategy and planned business objectives. Therefore, our compliance risk management is anessential element of the group wide ERM program. For example, we have mandatory processesand related tools for compliance due diligence of business partners, which are continuouslyadapted to cover emerging risks. They support the Siemens Energy units in risk-based integritychecks of business partners. At Siemens Energy we offer all employees and external third partiesprotected reporting channels to report violations of external and internal rules. We follow up onany indication of a violation. We monitor, evaluate and improve the Siemens Energy compliancesystem on a continuous basis.
12.8 Legal and Administrative Proceedings
In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in out-of-court disputes, litigation andarbitration proceedings as well as administrative proceedings. Frequently encountered situationsinclude claims based on alleged breach of contract (in particular claims from or against projectpartners and customers in connection with delays, poor or non-performance), labor disputes,antitrust issues, product liability and warranty claims as well as infringement or the validity of IPrights. For more information on the related risks, see “ 3.4.1 We are subject to risks from disputes
and administrative, legal and arbitration proceedings which could result in penalties, damagesand loss of reputation. ” and “ 3.4.4 Our risk management and internal controls may not prevent
or detect compliance risks, which could result in investigations by authorities, fines, damageclaims, payment claims, the termination of relationships with customers or suppliers and evengovernmental exclusion from businesses (blacklisting) as well as reputational damage. Further,our internal controls could fail to detect business risks in time or at all. ”. Except for the
proceedings described below, neither the Company nor any companies of the Siemens EnergyGroup are currently involved or have during the period of the past twelve months been involved,respectively, in any governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any suchproceedings which are pending or threatened of which we are aware), which may have or havehad in the recent past significant effects on the financial position or profitability of the Companyand/or the Siemens Energy Group.

12.8.1 Gas and Power Legal and Administrative Proceedings
12.8.1.1 Damage Claims Relating to an Alleged Late Completion of a Power Plant in BrazilIn March 2019, a Brazilian company asserted claims to pay an amount in a higher three-digit
million euro amount in local currency against a consortium of contractors and each member ofthe consortium, including our subsidiary Siemens Ltda., Brazil (“ Siemens Ltda. ”) in a lawsuit
relating to the construction of a power plant in Brazil that was completed in 2016. The membersof the consortium are jointly and severally liable, Siemens Ltda.’s share in the consortium is below3%. The consortium and its members defend themselves against the claim and for their partclaim payment in a lower three-digit million euro amount in local currency.
12.8.1.2 Damage Claims Relating to Alleged Overpricing in Relation to High-voltage Substations in
Brazil
In February 1996, the Public Attorney’s Office of Rio Grande do Sul filed lawsuit against Siemens
Ltda., as well as other companies and several individuals, for alleged overpricing in relation tothe erection and sale of five high-voltage substations and requested, inter alia, damages in aone-digit million euro amount in local currency from the consortium that Siemens Ltda.participated in, as well as blacklisting of the defendants. The claim amount is increased bymonetary adjustments for inflation and interest in a low to mid three-digit million euro amountin local currency. Siemens is defending itself against the action.

12.8.1.3 Legal Proceedings of Siemens Group Companies Relating to the Siemens Energy Business
Pursuant to contractual arrangements with Siemens AG, we bear the economic consequences of
certain legal disputes and proceedings related to our business to which companies withinSiemens Group that are not part of Siemens Energy are a party.
12.8.1.3.1 Anti-Competitive Arrangement in the Field of Gas-Insulated Switchgear in Israel
This includes claims brought against Siemens in connection with an alleged anti-competitive
arrangement between April 1988 and April 2004 in the field of gas-insulated switchgear in Israel.In September 2013, the Israeli Antitrust Authority concluded that Siemens AG was a party to anillegal restrictive arrangement regarding the Israeli gas-insulated switchgear market between1988 and 2004, with an interruption from October 1999 to February 2002. Siemens AG appealedagainst this decision in May 2014.
Based on the above mentioned conclusion of the Israeli Antitrust Authority, two electricity
consumer groups filed motions to certify a class action for cartel damages against a number ofcompanies including Siemens AG with an Israeli State Court in September 2013. One of the classactions was dismissed by the court in the fiscal year 2015. The remaining class action seekscompensation for alleged damages amounting to ILS 2.8 billion (as of September 30, 2019equivalent to €739 million). In addition, the Israel Electric Corporation filed at the end of
December 2013 with an Israeli State Court a separate ILS 3.8 billion (as of September 30, 2019equivalent to €997 million) claim for damages against Siemens AG and other companies that
allegedly formed a cartel in the Israeli gas-insulated switchgear market. A settlement agreementconcluded in December 2018 has been approved by the Israeli Court. Following payment of a middouble-digit million euro figure as settlement amount in July 2020, the matter was finally settled.
12.8.1.3.2 Litigations with TenneT Entities Relating to the Connection of Offshore Wind Power Plants in
Germany
In December 2016, the BorWin Offshore Consortium (“ BorWin ”) established between Siemens AG
and another company filed a lawsuit against TenneT Offshore 1. Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbHwith the district court of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, asserting contractual claims of nowapproximately €88 million. The lawsuit relates to the connection of the offshore wind power
plants in the cluster ‘Borwin’ to the grid. TenneT Offshore 1. Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH set offwith counterclaims in the amount of approximately €67 million. In January 2020, TenneT
Offshore 1. Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH filed further counterclaims against BorWin asserting,inter alia, the correction of defects with an alleged value of approximately €60 million. BorWin
disputes the set-off and is defending itself against all counterclaims.
In December 2016, the Helwin Offshore Consortium (“ Helwin ”) established between Siemens AG
and another company filed a lawsuit against TenneT Offshore GmbH with the district court ofFrankfurt am Main, Germany, asserting contractual claims of now approximately €91 million.
The lawsuit relates to the connection of the offshore wind power plants in the cluster ‘HelWin’ tothe grid. TenneT Offshore GmbH set off with counterclaims in the amount of approximately€55 million. In January 2020, TenneT Offshore GmbH filed further counterclaims against Helwin

12.8.1.4 Legal Proceedings of Siemens Energy Group Companies Relating to the Siemens Business
In some countries, the separation of Siemens Energy from Siemens Group was executed by way of
a reverse carve-out, i.e., the businesses within a regional company that remains with Siemens
Group were transferred out of such regional company into a newly established Siemens Grouplegal entity.
As a result, legal proceedings against such regional company arising in connection with business
activities that were previously conducted by such regional company and that do not pertain tothe Siemens Energy business will remain with such regional company, which is now part ofSiemens Energy. Siemens Energy and Siemens Group have reached agreements to allocate theresulting financial risks in accordance with the separation of the business activities. However, itcannot be excluded at this stage that, as a result of those legal proceedings, such regionalcompany might also be (temporarily or permanently) barred from conducting certain or anybusiness in the respective region, or even be dissolved.
These statements also apply to legal proceedings in Brazil to which Siemens Ltda. is a party and
which result out, among others, Siemens’ businesses transferred into newly established SiemensGroup legal entities (such as Siemens Infraestrutura e Indústria Ltda., Siemens Mobility Ltda.,Siemens Healthcare Diagnósticos S.A.). These legal proceedings remain with Siemens Energy’ssubsidiary in Brazil. For more information, see Note 27 to the Audited Combined FinancialStatements, which are included in “ 21 Financial Information ” of this Prospectus on page F-1 et
seq.
12.8.2 SGRE Legal and Administrative Proceedings
12.8.2.1 Settlement Agreement with ArevaIn March 2020, Adwen Offshore, S.L.U. and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy Wind Farms, S.A.
(two SGRE subsidiaries), together with SGRE S.A., reached a final settlement agreement withAreva Energies Renouvelables SAS and Areva S.A. (France) (hereinafter together, “ Areva ”)
settling certain disputes between the parties relating to a joint venture between SGRE and Areva(the Adwen joint venture) and to an indemnification regime agreed thereupon regarding thepotential claims that could arise under the projects brought by Areva to the joint venture. Arevawill pay Adwen Offshore, S.L.U. a settlement payment amounting to €72.4 million, which will be
paid out in two tranches of €36.2 million each, on or before January 31, 2021 and on or before
December 31, 2021, respectively. In addition, a further amount of €26.4 million will be offset
against a shareholder loan.
12.8.2.2 Claims Based on a Wind Power Plant Project in Germany
Adwen GmbH (a subsidiary of SGRE) was party to a proceeding pending before the Dispute
Adjudication Board based in Hamburg (“ DAB”), which concerns claims and counterclaims of
Adwen GmbH (including Adwen’s former shareholder Areva, S.A.) and one of its customersrelating to a wind power plant project in Germany. In June 2019, the DAB resolved that AdwenGmbH is responsible for the remediation of certain defects, providing different deadlines (untilMarch 2020) for the remediation. At the same time, the DAB awarded certain monetarypayments to Adwen GmbH for unpaid invoices and as compensation for delays and projectdisruptions. Before the resolutions became legally binding, both parties agreed to start anegotiation period (for mediation). With effect as of August 15, 2020, the parties entered into afinal settlement agreement. In such settlement agreement, the parties have agreed that the DABdecisions shall be final and binding and have specified how such decisions shall be implemented.In addition, the agreement includes certain rules regarding the commercial relationship amongthe parties going forward as well as the settlement of their claims regarding alleged defects ofthe supplied wind energy converters and alleged project delays.
356
12.8.2.3 Customer Claim Regarding a Commercial Dispute Relating to Project Delays
Furthermore, contract delays and adjustments to the scope of work occur from time to time for a
number of reasons, including factors outside of SGRE’s control. If disputes with customers arisedue to problems with the execution of contracts, SGRE may negotiate variations to the contractwith its customers to reach a mutually acceptable solution. For example, SGRE is involved in acustomer claim regarding a commercial dispute relating to execution delays in a project. Towardsthe end of 2019, the customer alleged that SGRE has delayed the project and is claimingliquidated damages for the delays up to the contractual capped amount. In early 2020, SGREsuccessfully objected to (and was thus granted a court injunction against) the drawdown of bankguarantees by the customer. With respect to the relevant customer contract, SGRE rejects theclaim. Currently, SGRE intends – and continues to make reasonable efforts – to reach an amicablesolution with the customer during the course of 2020.
12.8.2.4 Disputes or Disagreements Regarding IP Rights
In addition, in the normal course of business, seldom disputes arise with competitors or other
third parties concerning the validity of IP rights or infringements of IP. SGRE is party to a numberof license agreements which afford SGRE IP rights (in particular, patents, trademarks and designrights) that are necessary or useful for its business. In a few individual cases, there have beendisputes or disagreements resulting from the interpretation regarding the execution of theexisting agreements or from the interpretation of the scope of use rights granted by third parties(including competitors) to SGRE regarding their respective IP rights, or with respect to alleged IPinfringements. While some of those disputes in the past years have been finally solved by court infavor of SGRE, others are still awaiting a final resolution, or have not reached a court stage andstill remain to be solved between the respective parties.
On July 31, 2020, General Electric Company (“ GE”) filed intellectual property related lawsuits
against SGRE entities with the District Court ( Landgericht ) in Düsseldorf, Germany, and before
the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ ITC”) asserting a violation of two patents with regard
to certain variable speed wind turbine generators and components. The German lawsuit seeks aninjunction against SGRE, mainly in relation to the manufacturing, offering and marketing of therelevant wind turbine generators and components in Germany, and financial compensation forany (alleged) infringing action performed after July 15, 2020. The U.S. ITC complaint seeks anexclusion order against SGRE’s importation of certain wind turbine equipment into the UnitedStates.
Should the complainant be successful, the financial burden to SGRE could be significant. There is
the risk that SGRE will not be able to complete projects or to win new projects for which theaffected wind turbine generators or components are required in Germany and/or the UnitedStates, or will only be able to do so at a higher cost ( e.g., if it had to resort to alternative
generators or components). Furthermore, if GE’s patents were found to be valid and infringedupon by SGRE, SGRE could be forced to obtain a license from GE. SGRE will be defending againstGE’s claims. In addition, SGRE has launched an opposition appeal before the European PatentOffice in Munich, Germany, against the European patent which is the basis of the Germanlawsuit; a resolution on the appeal is still pending.
It cannot be excluded that SGRE will be involved in further disputes of such kind in individual
cases in the future.
12.9 Material Contracts
12.9.1 Siemens Energy Facility Agreement
On July 7, 2020, a syndicate consisting of 7 banks as coordinating mandated lead arrangers
(Merrill Lynch International Designated Activity Company, BNP Paribas S.A. NiederlassungDeutschland, COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft, Credit Suisse International, Deutsche Bank AG,Goldman Sachs Bank USA and J.P. Morgan Securities plc), 9 banks as mandated lead arrangers(Bank of China Limited Zweigniederlassung Frankfurt am Main Frankfurt Branch, Citigroup

Frankfurt Branch, Standard CharteredBank and UniCredit Bank AG), SE Global GmbH & Co. KG and Siemens Energy Finance B.V.concluded a facility agreement regarding a multicurrency revolving credit facility with amaximum total volume of €3 billion (the “ Facility Agreement ”). On August 14, 2020, further
twelve banks (Bayerische Landesbank, DZ BANK AG, First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC, LandesbankBaden-Württemberg, Mizuho Bank Ltd., The Toronto-Dominion Bank, LandesbankHessen-Thüringen Girozentrale, MUFG Bank (Europe) N.V., Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB,The Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Banco BilbaoVizcaya Argentaria S.A.) acceded to the Facility Agreement.
The revolving credit facility may be drawn in euro, Pound Sterling or U.S. dollar and, subject to
the consent of the banks, in other currencies. The loans will each be used to finance generalcorporate purposes. A sublimit of €1 billion may also be used as a swingline facility with a
shortened drawing notice period in order to refinance any note or other instrument maturingunder a euro commercial paper program. The initial borrowers will be SE Global GmbH & Co. KGand Siemens Energy Finance B.V. There is a requirement for Siemens Energy AG to accede to theFacility Agreement as a guarantor shortly after Spin-Off Completion (the “ SE Accession ”). SE
Global GmbH & Co. KG and, following the SE Accession, Siemens Energy AG will guarantee for allpayment obligations of the borrowers under the Facility Agreement.
The Facility Agreement has an initial term of three years, with two extension options for one
year each, which are however at the discretion of the lenders.
The loans will bear interest at a variable currency-related reference rate plus a margin. The
margin will depend on the rating of Siemens Energy AG by Moody’s Deutschland GmbH, S&PGlobal Ratings Europe Limited and/or Fitch Deutschland GmbH. Furthermore, the FacilityAgreement provides for upward or downward adjustments of the margin that will depend onthe level of achievement of certain ESG targets. In each case, the reference rate will have a floorof zero so that the full margin will remain payable in the case of a negative reference rate. Inaddition, the Facility Agreement provides for fees and indemnifications in favor of the banks.
In addition, the Facility Agreement contains certain covenants, obligations and termination
rights. In particular, certain material subsidiaries of Siemens Energy AG (but excluding SGRE) aresubject to restrictions regarding the entering into financial indebtedness. Such materialsubsidiaries, as well as the borrowers and guarantors are further subject to restrictions on theprovision of collateral for financial indebtedness and certain disposals of assets. The FacilityAgreement does not include financial covenants.
The lenders are entitled, subject to certain exemptions and cure periods, to accelerate and
terminate the Facility Agreement in a number of circumstances, including, but not limited to,(i) if the borrowers or the guarantors are in breach of their duties (including paymentobligations, breaches of covenants, material misrepresentations) under the Facility Agreement,(ii) if grounds for the commencement of insolvency proceedings against a borrower or guarantoror certain material subsidiaries arise or such proceedings are initiated, (iii) if Siemens Energy AGor certain other entities default on payments under certain other financial indebtedness or ifsuch indebtedness is accelerated, which in aggregate exceed a certain threshold, (iv) if SE GlobalGmbH & Co. KG ceases to be a subsidiary of Siemens Energy or other obligors cease to be asubsidiary of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, (v) if Siemens Energy Group ceases, or threatens to cease,
358
to carry on all or substantially all of its business as it was conducted by Siemens AG and its
subsidiaries as of the date of the Facility Agreement and which is being carved out into a newlyformed subgroup to be operated by Siemens Energy Group following completion of the Spin-Off,or (vi) if the SE Accession does not occur within 10 business days following Spin-Off Completion(subject to a 30 day remedy period).
Following the SE Accession, if Siemens Energy AG becomes a subsidiary of any other company, or
any person or a group of persons acting together acquires control over Siemens Energy AG, eachlender may request, within ten business days beginning with the date of the receipt of thechange of control event notice by the facility agent, that its participation in the outstandingloans and all other amounts accrued under the Facility Agreement and related agreements aredeclared due and payable.
12.9.2 Certain SGRE Financing Agreements
On May 30, 2018, SGRE S.A. signed a syndicated multi-currency term and revolving credit facilities
agreement amounting to a total of €2.5 billion (taken together), originally with
COMMERZBANK Aktiengesellschaft, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (“ BBVA ”) and BNP
PARIBAS S.A. Surcursal en España acting as coordinating bookrunners and mandated leadarrangers. This agreement replaced a former €750 million multi-currency syndicated credit
facility agreement entered into in the fiscal year 2017 by Gamesa, which had remained unused,and several stand-alone financing arrangements on the SGRE subsidiary and project level. The2017 facility was deemed insufficient for the need of the much larger merged company SGRE S.A.
The 2018 credit facilities agreement included a fully-drawn term loan tranche of €500 million,
which was initially set to mature on May 30, 2021, and a multi-currency, revolving credit linetranche of €2.0 billion initially maturing on May 30, 2023, with two one-year extension options.
As of September 30, 2019, and September 30, 2018, €500 million and €700 million, respectively,
had been drawn under these facilities (on aggregate). The revolving credit facility could be usedfor general corporate purposes and the term facility could be used to refinance outstandingdebt. The facilities agreement was based on the Loan Market Association investment gradetemplate facility with a 0% floor, a margin grid linked to the ratio of net financial debt andEBITDA, and with no financial covenants. In the event that any person or group of persons actingin concert (a) owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the equity share capital or votingrights of SGRE S.A.; or (b) has the right to appoint the majority of the members of SGRE S.A.’sboard of directors, and therefore acquires control over SGRE S.A., each of the participatingfinancial institutions may negotiate with SGRE S.A. in good faith for a period of 30 daysregarding the maintenance of the financial institution’s commitments under the facilitiesagreement. In the event that an agreement is not reached, the financial institution(s) in questionmay cancel all or part of its/their commitments and require full or partial prepayment of theirparticipation in the financing.
On December 19, 2019, SGRE amended and extended this €2.5 billion syndicated loan by an
amendment and restatement agreement, extending the maturity dates of the €500 million loan
and the €2 billion revolving tranche to December 19, 2022 and December 19, 2024, respectively.
The maturity of the €2 billion revolving tranche may be extended by one further year on the
first and second anniversary of the signature of the agreement if SGRE solicits the extension,subject to a favorable decision of the banks. Besides the original banks mentioned above,Citigroup Global Markets Limited and Banco Santander, S.A. (“ Santander ”) act under the
amended and restated facility agreement as coordinators. SGRE announced that it would use thefunds to finance recurring activity. As part of the refinancing, SGRE was able to secure moreflexible conditions due to its investment grade credit rating, reducing restrictions on loans out,third-party guarantees and others. In addition, the pricing of this syndicated loan is tied tosustainability ( i.e., environmental social and corporate governance) criteria, in line with SGRE’s
new “green” financing strategy. Thus, this transaction constitutes SGRE’s first “green” financingfacility. In addition, the amended and restated agreement also clarified that the transfer ofSiemens AG’s interest in SGRE S.A. to Siemens Energy AG in connection with the Spin-Off will notconstitute a change of control for purposes of the agreement, provided that no third party ( i.e., a
359
party other than Siemens AG or Siemens Energy AG) holds direct or indirect control over SGRE
S.A. Similar language has been included in all financing facilities (bilateral agreements, includingthose mentioned below) wherever change-of-control language is contemplated.
In March and May 2019, SGRE S.A. signed new bilateral credit lines at a variable rate with BBVA,
Santander, Société Générale, BNP PARIBAS and CaixaBank amounting to €512 million in total, of
which €412 million matured in 2020 and were extended until 2021. As of June 30, 2020, SGRE
had not drawn any amount related to these credit lines. These credit lines are senior unsecuredlines, with pari passu , cross-default and no covenants attached. In May 2020, additional bilateral
credit lines with same-tenor terms and structure were signed with COMMERZBANKAktiengesellschaft and Kutxabank, adding up to €125 million. In July 2020, SGRE S.A. increased
the bilateral credit line with Santander included in the €512 million from €100 million to €150
million.
In addition, SGRE has entered into agreements with several financial institutions regarding
so-called “green” guarantee lines. In a deal arranged with BNP PARIBAS, the company converteda€240 million guarantee line into a “green” line and signed an additional line for €110 million
in September 2019. That €350 million is in addition to €900 million in guarantees arranged
with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria in January 2019. SGRE has stated that it will use this line toissue guarantees for its business of manufacturing and selling onshore and offshore windturbines worldwide, with a positive impact on the SDG relating to “affordable and clean energy”and “climate action”. Furthermore, in December 2019 SGRE completed a deal with SociétéGénérale to convert a €230 million guarantee line to “green”. SGRE will use this line for its
worldwide business of manufacturing onshore and offshore wind turbine generators. In addition,in early January 2020 SGRE extended a guarantee line from Danske Bank to €150 million (from
an initial €100 million) and included SDG criteria. Likewise, SGRE signed and included similar
conditions for a new €140 million guarantee from Mizuho Bank Europe N.V. in January 2020.
Moreover, at the end of October 2019, SGRE arranged sustainable foreign exchange hedgingcontracts in a landmark transaction coordinated with BNP PARIBAS. On SGRE’s account, thetransaction represents another significant step in its commitment to sustainable developmentacross all its activities, with which SGRE has converted a notional total of €174 million in foreign
currency exchange hedging deals to “green” transactions. The derivatives are used not only tohedge the foreign exchange exposure of selling offshore wind turbines in Taiwan (a renewableenergy project), but also have an impact on the SDG targets related to “climate action”, and“affordable and clean energy”. In addition, BNP PARIBAS is committing to reinvest any premiumin a reforestation project in Spain.
On May 18, 2019, SGRE signed a sustainability-linked syndicated bank guarantee line for up to
€600 million to cover the construction of wind turbines for Hornsea Two, the largest offshore
wind power plant to be announced to date. Located in the North Sea and owned by Danishutility company Ørsted, the power plant will consist of 165 SGRE wind turbines (with a total of1.4 GW). BNP PARIBAS lead managed the deal, in which BBVA, Mizuho and Santander alsoparticipated. Under this agreement, the company will pay a premium in the event that it fails toachieve the defined ESG targets; otherwise, the premium will be paid by BNP PARIBAS, togetherwith BBVA and Santander. In either case, the established premium on the deal will be used tofinance a cancer research project in Spain.
12.9.3 Acquisition of Selected European Assets of Senvion

The shares were transferred free of any security, encumbrances or charges. The overall price in
cash for the shares of Senvion Deutschland GmbH and Ria Blades, S.A. amounts to €200 million,
subject to closing accounts confirmation adjustments. For more information, see“9.4.8.4 Acquisition of Senvion Group Assets ”. In addition, SGRE estimates that business
provisions and one-off costs associated to the carve-out and integration as well as restructuring-related costs amounted to approximately €150 million.
As part of the Senvion Acquisition, nearly 2,000 employees from Senvion joined SGRE between
January and April 2020.
The consummation of the Senvion Acquisition was subject to the fulfillment of certain closing
conditions, such as consent of competent authorities, completion of the carve-out measures andsecurity release as well as the operational readiness of the relevant target company. Theacquisition of the Senvion Deutschland GmbH and its European subsidiaries was completed inJanuary 2020, while the acquisition of Ria Blades, S.A. closed in April 2020.
In February 2020, SGRE entered into a loan agreement with the Spanish Bankia S.A. in the
amount of €175 million to finance the Senvion Acquisition. The loan adheres to ESG criteria and
is therefore counted as a sustainable loan. The loan agreement includes a premium that SGREwould have to pay to Bankia S.A. if SGRE’s ranking in sustainability indices changes. In such case,Bankia S.A. would use the proceeds from the premium to finance sustainable projects. Inaddition, SGRE signed a second loan agreement with Bankinter in the amount of €65 million to
finance the Senvion acquisition, which is substantially subject to the same terms as the onesigned with Bankia S.A.
12.9.4 Agreements with Siemens
Until Spin-Off Completion, we had various relationships with Siemens in the past and will
continue to have, modified and reduced, relationships with Siemens in the future. In particular,we received certain services relating to human resources, real estate, IT, IP, legal, compliance,procurement, export control and customs, treasury and other areas and were part of the cashmanagement system and global insurance coverage of Siemens. A limited number of services insome areas will partially continue for a transition period after the Spin-Off Completion, in otherareas we have already built up our own resources. For further details see “ 18.1 Transactions and
Relationships with the Siemens Group ”.

13 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
At our main production sites in Europe (Germany, UK, Spain, Sweden, Hungary and the Czech
Republic), USA, Canada, China, Brazil and Mexico, we develop and manufacture products,components, systems and solutions for customers who are active across the entire energy valuechain from generation, to transmission and distribution. Our product portfolio includesswitchgear, transformers and high-voltage components (see “ 12.3.1 Transmission Division ”),
compressors, aero-derivative and small industrial gas turbines as well as subsea products (see“12.3.3 Industrial Applications Division ”), gas and steam turbines (see “ 12.3.2 Generation
Division”) as well as renewable energies such as wind turbines for onshore and offshore wind
power plants (see “ 12.4 SGRE Segment ”). We sell these products and provide our solutions and
services in nearly every country on the globe.
Our business and operations are affected by various national and international rules, regulations
and standards. At the outset, this concerns requirements related to the production of ourproducts at our global sites. Production regulation includes not only permit requirements for ourproduction facilities, specific equipment or production methods, but also environmental as wellas health and safety standards. In addition to our production process also our products as suchare subject to regulation, for example technical design specifications. Some rules are directlyapplicable to our production and products, others are rather customer- or market-related, such aswhere customers as operators of our products have to comply with environmental standards orwhere climate protection policies aim at the decarbonization of energy markets. This regulationindirectly also affects our production processes and/or our products. In addition, the sale of ourproducts to customers, particularly customers abroad, is subject to certain market accessregulations, like export control laws. Finally, we must abide by laws applicable to all types ofentities regardless of their specific business, e.g., data privacy and competition law. All of these
rules, regulations and standards are subject to frequent, sometimes unpredictable, changes andare supervised by the relevant authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct ourbusiness.
We have implemented management systems that are designed to ensure compliance with all
these requirements and we have in most cases obtained certifications of these systems regardingquality (ISO 9001), environmental protection (ISO 14001), occupational health and safety (OHSAS18001/ISO 45001) as well as in some cases certifications of specific aspects of our production orlocation of work, such as energy management (ISO 50001), welding workshops (ISO 3834),laboratories (ISO 17025) or safety certificates for conducting our activities on our clients’premises. On the one hand, these efforts contribute to our overall quality and compliance goalsand, on the other hand, they also fulfill our clients’ basic conditions for cooperation and business.
13.1 Production Regulations
13.1.1 General Permit and Statutory Requirements for Industrial Installations
The manufacturing of our products depends on permits, approvals and other governmental
authorizations and must comply with statutory requirements. On a regular basis, theconstruction, operation and/or material alteration of industrial installations requires acomprehensive permit (integrated permit) or a set of different permits which take into accountbuilding and planning law, operational safety as well as environmental impacts such as pollutantand noise emissions, vibrations and comparable harmful effects.
Additional regulations often apply to the operation and production processes in such
installations regarding the materials used for the production processes (for instance, chemicals)as well as water discharge, waste disposal and air emissions. Although the standards ofproduction regulations, requirements and restrictions differ in detail to a certain extent in thecountries in which we manufacture our products, the basic principles are generally comparable.However, we do not produce all of our products at all of our main production sites. Therefore,some specific aspects of production regulation are only relevant for our production processes inspecific jurisdictions.
362
13.1.2 Emission Control Regulations
Our production processes generate different types of emissions including pollutants, noise
emissions, vibrations, odors and polluted waters. Statutory requirements limit the extent ofpermitted emissions and require us to take technical precautions to avoid harmful effects of ourinstallations on the environment and not endanger or cause significant disadvantages ornuisances to the general public or neighborhood.
13.1.2.1 Surface Treatments, Coating of Objects and Impregnation
The treatment of surfaces of objects with synthetic resin is one particular method used during
our production processes, among other things to connect and seal parts (rotor bodies and copperinserts) of generators that we produce at several global sites. Synthetic resin is generally a sourceof strong odors. For that reason, these types of treatment plants often require a permit underlocal emission control regulations, for example, under the German Federal Emission Control Act(Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz ,“BImSchG ”) in connection with the Fourth Ordinance for the
Implementation of the Federal Emission Control Act ( Verordnung über genehmigungsbedürftige
Anlagen ,“4. BImSchV ”) at our German sites, in particular, in Erfurt and Muelheim an der Ruhr,
or under the Clean Air Act (“ CAA”) for our U.S. sites in Charlotte and Fort Payne. In other
jurisdictions, a separate permit is not required but the synthetic resin emissions from ourproduction process must comply with specific thresholds, for instance in China under theIntegrated Emission Standard for Air Pollutants (GB16297:1996). In Brazil, environmental permitsalso include limits for odor emissions that extend beyond the respective industrial property.Similarly, the coating of objects with metallic protective layers or plasma at our German sites inBerlin and Duisburg and our U.S. site in Charlotte also require a permit under the 4. BImSchV orthe CAA, respectively. Equivalent permit requirements or regulations often also apply under locallaw for the coating of gas-powered engines as well as for impregnation of some transformercomponents produced at our sites globally.
The manufacturing of rotor blades by SGRE at several production locations including Spain, the
UK, USA, China, Denmark and India involves the saturation of fiberglass components of theblades with liquid epoxy resins, which causes different air emissions, in particular, volatile organiccompounds. Such environmental impacts are either subject to permit requirements or statutoryprovisions under local emission control regulations, such as the Environmental PermittingRegulations 2018 (England and Wales), the CAA and related state regulations in the USA or therespective Environmental Protection and Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Acts in China,Denmark and India. Further permit requirements apply to the use of epoxy adhesive duringassembly of the blade shells because of the use of organic solvents in these adhesives.
13.1.2.2 Operation of Cooling Systems
Waste heat generated during our production processes is removed by cooling systems. These
cooling systems are prone to contamination (legionella bacteria), which could generally bedistributed in the environment in the course of evaporation. In order to ensure that technical andorganizational measures are implemented to avoid the emission of legionella bacteria, the Forty-Second Ordinance Implementing the Federal Emission Control Act on Evaporative CoolingSystems, Cooling Towers and Wet Separators ( Verordnung über Verdunstungskühlanlagen,
Kühltürme und Nassabscheider ,42. BImSchV ) requires us to permanently monitor and report the
legionella concentrations of the cooling systems that we operate. If we exceed the statutorythresholds, we have to take remedial measures and inform the authority accordingly. In Brazil,the National Health Surveillance Agency Ordinance 3523/1998 and Resolution 09/2003 set similarcontrol and monitoring requirements. In China the Standard HG/T 4323-2012 applies to thedetection and enumeration of legionella in circulating cooling water with reference to therequirements under IS011731:1998 and IS011731-2:2004.
13.1.2.3 Operation of Power Plants
We also operate power plants (cogeneration units) at some of our sites, for instance in Muelheim
an der Ruhr, Germany, to produce part of the electricity required for our manufacturing process.
363
In Germany, the construction, operation and material alteration of such power plants requires a
permit under BImSchG in connection with 4. BImSchV and the Forty-Fourth OrdinanceImplementing the Federal Emission Control Act on Medium-Sized Combustion Plants(Verordnung über mittelgroße Feuerungsanlagen ,“44. BImSchV ”), which implements the
requirements of Directive (EU) 2015/2193 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants intothe air from medium combustion plants. Equivalent permit requirements, statutory emissionlimitations or air quality standards apply to several of our other production sites, such as underthe CAA and related legislation in the USA or the Environmental Protection Act in Canada. InChina, the Environmental Protection Law sets general standards of environmental protection, thePrevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution Law prevents and controls air pollution toensure public health and a pollution discharge permit is required for power plants under theRegulation on Pollution Discharge Permitting. In Brazil, prevention and control of air pollutionand permit procedures are governed by the National Air Pollution Control Program andresolutions of the National Environment Council (“ CONAMA ”), for example for our operations in
the north region.
13.1.2.4 Testing Facilities
We operate testing facilities ( Prüfstände ) for our products in different jurisdictions. Such testing
covers different stages of a product from development up to acceptance testing. Depending onthe proprieties of our testing facilities we may have to obtain specific permits or comply withcertain statutory obligations. For example, our testing facilities at some of our sites, e.g., in
Germany (like in Berlin and Ludwigsfelde), UK, Sweden, and the Czech Republic require a permitunder local emission control law because of the high rated thermal output(Feuerungswärmeleistung ) of the tested components. Another permit may be required for
storage facilities for fuels that we use during turbine testing. Where our storage capacity exceedscertain thresholds, we must fulfil increased operator obligations in accordance with Directive2012/18/EU on the control of major-accident hazards (Seveso III), which includes implementationof a major-accident prevention policy for things like the liquid gas storage tank at our Swedishsite in Finspång.
Regarding GHG emissions produced in particular during testing activities, the European Emission
Trading System (“ EU ETS ”), established by Directive (EC) 2003/87 as last revised by Directive (EU)
2018/410, requires us to provide emission certificates (“ EUAs ”) to the competent authority, in
particular for our cogeneration units, but also for the combustion process during the testing ofour gas turbines. In the energy sector allowances have already been auctioned since 2013. InGermany, these requirements are transposed into the GHG Emissions Trading Act ( Treibhausgas-
Emissionshandelsgesetz ). In China, the Environmental Protection Tax Law aims at a reduction of
pollutants by imposing taxes on the discharge of specified pollutants.
In addition, our test devices can be connected to water breaks, which cause significant noise
emissions. Such noise emissions are subject to prevention and control laws applicable to all of ourproduction sites. Under Directive (EC) 2002/49 on environmental noise (“ END”) each EU member
state must identify noise pollution levels (noise mapping). Determining limits and target values aswell as appropriate noise protection measures, however, remains at the discretion of thecompetent member state authorities. Our industrial installations are also recorded in such noisemaps. Where our industrial installations jointly with others cause harmful noise emissions, wemay be required to implement corrective measures, such as noise protection or reduction of noiseemissions during the night. In Germany, the END was implemented by an amendment to theBImSchG. Further noise prevention and control laws that either set permit requirements orstatutory thresholds include the U.S. Noise Control Act, the Chinese Noise Pollution PreventionLaw, and Brazilian CONAMA Resolution 1, of March 8, 1990, on emissions of noise from industrialactivity.
SGRE does not require separate permits for component testing during product development or
manufacturing and assembly, but only for full turbine (prototype) testing, which is typically
364
conducted in Denmark (Høvsøre and Østerild) or in Spain (Alaiz). For both countries, a local
building permit is required and in Denmark SGRE also has to obtain a prototype certificate underthe Danish Executive Order no. 73 of January 25, 2013.
13.1.3 Environmental Responsibilities Related to our Production Process
13.1.3.1 Use of Waters and Discharge of Process and Waste WaterThe resources and products we require to manufacture our own products as well as the devices
we operate to test our products are in part also subject to regulation. For example, for the waterofftake from rivers and wells to use as process waters in our cooling systems, as at our Germansite in Nuremberg, requires a permit under the German Federal Water Act(Wasserhaushaltsgesetz ,“WHG ”). The same applies to the discharge of wastewater into
sewerage facilities, for example under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales)Regulations 2016 for our UK sites. Wastewater standards for our U.S. production sites have beenset by the Environmental Protection Agency (“ EPA”) under the Clean Water Act, which also
regulates the discharge of pollutants into water and water quality standards. Our Chinese sitesrequire a wastewater discharge permit under the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution Law.In Brazil, the National Water Resources Policy (Federal Law 9433/1997) sets general standards forwater use and CONAMA Resolutions 357/2005 and 430/2011 regulate the discharge of pollutantsinto water. Additional water law permits are required for the operation of wastewater systemssuch as our oil separators. Since some of the substances we work with are hazardous to waters,water laws also set prevention, control and monitoring obligations. Also SGRE’s production sitesdepend on water usage and/or wastewater discharge permits in addition to the aforementionedlegislation, for instance in Spain under the Royal Legislative Decree No. 1/2001 or in India underthe Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Act.
13.1.3.2 Use of Hazardous Substances
Another aspect of protection against adverse health and safety effects concerns chemicals and
hazardous substances. Numerous restrictions and requirements apply with respect to the accessto and the use of chemicals and hazardous substances required for our manufacturing orcommissioning processes. For example, as a global process we successfully manage theproduction, dispatch, use and disposal of a special pickling chemical required during thecommissioning of heat recovery boilers. In the EU these issues are covered by Regulation (EC)1907/2006 (“ REACH ”). Under Regulation (EC) 1272/2008 (“ CLP Regulation ”) we also have to
ensure that substances are classified, labeled and packaged in accordance with the hazard degreeof their properties. This particularly concerns lacquers, resins and oils that we use for coating oras lubricant for product components. For the enforcement of REACH and the CLP Regulation,supplementary provisions have been enacted, such as in the German Chemicals Act(Chemikaliengesetz ). The use of some chemicals has generally been prohibited altogether, for
instance under the German Chemicals Prohibition Ordinance ( Chemikalien-Verbotsverordnung ).
Similarly in the USA, the Toxic Substances Control Act (“ TSCA ”) addresses, inter alia, the
importation, use and disposal of specific chemicals. In China, the Dangerous ChemicalsManagement Law addresses risks in connection with production, use, operation andtransportation of hazardous chemicals. In Mexico, the General Law of Ecological Balance andEnvironmental Protection ( Ley General del Equilibrio Ecológico y la Protección al Ambiente ,
“LGEEPA ”) concerns the handling of substances with flammable, explosive, toxic, reactive,
radioactive, corrosive or biological properties in amounts endangering the environment orgeneral population.
13.1.3.3 Use of Radiation Devices, Laser and Other Testing Equipment
We have obtained further permits related to the development, manufacture, testing and
inspection of our products, including permits under the German Radiation Protection Ordinance(Strahlenschutzverordnung ) or the Swedish Radiation Protection Act (SFS 1988:220) concerning
the operation of portable and stationary non-medical X-ray units ( Röntgeneinrichtungen ) for the
365
non-destructive testing of pipes and flanges, among other things. Comparable permit
requirements for our U.S. sites have been set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, whichensures the safe use of radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes. Under the IonizingRadiation Regulations 2017 in the UK we have to register radiation devices used mainly fortesting of welding of pipes with the competent authority along with certificates of testing. SGREalso uses radiation and laser equipment for testing at blade production facilities in Spain, UK,Denmark, China and the USA, in particular for detection of defects. This equipment also requiresa permit and/or a notification to the competent authority under local law.
Requirements for pressure equipment that we use for leakage tests of vessels must comply with
Directive (EU) 2014/68 on Pressure Equipment and the German Pressure Equipment Ordinance. Apermit under the German Explosives Act ( Sprengstoffgesetz ) allows us to use explosive substances
as propellant in isolating switches of switchgears during research activities in Berlin andNuremberg in case a short circuit is produced. We also operate sources of non-ionizing radiation,i.e., laser for powder welding during our additive manufacturing processes or for the curing of
edges and surfaces as well as precise metering of lengths. In some jurisdiction like in the UK werequire a permit for some of these activities, but even where these installations do not require apermit (like under the German BImSchG) we are nonetheless obligated to operate any suchinstallation in a manner avoiding harmful effects on the environment. For our non-destructivetesting using gammagraphy at our Brazilian sites in Jundiaí and Santa Bárbara D’Oeste we mustcomply with the standards set by the National Nuclear Energy Commission on generalradiological protection as well as safety requirements and radiological protection for industrialradiography services.
13.1.3.4 Waste Production and Management
During our manufacturing process we also produce different kinds of waste including packaging
and industrial waste. Waste laws in all the countries in which we operate generally require us toreduce waste and to dispose of the different types of waste in a manner consistent with itsproperties so that it does not endanger human health or harm the environment. In Europe,Directive (EC) 2008/98 as last amended by Directive (EU) 2018/851 (“ Waste Framework Directive ”)
requires EU member states to take appropriate measures in this regard. In addition to the WasteFramework Directive, Directive (EC) 94/62 as last amended by Directive (EU) 2018/852 (PackagingWaste Directive) contains supplementary producer responsibility regimes applicable to ourbusiness activities. Different member states’ laws transpose these EU requirements, such as theWaste Management Act ( Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz ) and the Packaging Act ( Verpackungsgesetz
2019) in Germany or the Environmental Code (SFS 1998:808) in Sweden. Under the EU CircularEconomy Package 2018, the European Union also adopted Directive (EU) 2019/904 on thereduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment. This directive, which hasto be implemented in the member states by July 3, 2021, aims to prevent and reduce the impacton the environment of certain plastic products that are usually used only once or for a shortperiod of time, and to promote a transition to a circular economy by introducing a mix ofmeasures tailored to the products covered by the directive, including an EU-wide ban onsingle-use plastic products whenever alternatives are available. Proper management of hazardousand non-hazardous solid waste for our production sites in the USA is regulated in the ResourceConservation Control Act. In Brazil, there are a number of specific laws and regulations regardingeach type of waste and activity that, inter alia, standardize classification, storage, labeling,
transport and disposal of waste, in particular, Federal Law No. 12305 regarding the preventionand reduction of waste generation, increase of recycling, reuse and environmentally appropriatedisposal. Transport and disposal of hazardous waste also require a special permit of the localenvironmental authority. For our Chinese sites, the Prevention and Control of Solid WastePollution Law sets standards for prevention and control of pollution by solid waste.
13.1.3.5 Liability for Environmental Impacts
Due to the historical and current industrial use of some of the production sites that we own and
occupy, it cannot be excluded that we may be held liable to investigate and remediate present
366
environmental impacts. There are, however, no globally applicable principles or even a European
harmonized framework on environmental liability. Under the German Federal Soil Protection Act(Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz ), for example, we may be held liable irrespective of whether we have
caused the contamination. Where an environmental damage occurs that was caused by ourbusiness activities that are potentially dangerous to the environment we may be held liableunder the German Federal Environmental Damage Act ( Umweltschadensgesetz ). In the USA, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund Law) andsimilar state statutes impose retroactive, strict, and joint and several liability on current and priorowners or operators of contaminated sites, and on parties that disposed of or transportedhazardous substances to contaminated sites. In Brazil, Federal Law 6938/1981 requires pollutersto remedy environmental damages caused and CONAMA Resolution 420 establishes directives forthe environmental management of contaminated areas. In Mexico, LGEEPA holds persons orentities liable for actions or omissions that cause damage to the environment and requires themto take out insurance to remediate environmental damage.
13.1.3.6 Transportation of Dangerous Goods
Some of our products also contain or require hazardous substances with toxic or other defined
properties, such as oils, nitrogen or battery acid. We transport such dangerous goods to ourcustomers either as an integral part of our products or separately for later use in our products.Any transport of dangerous goods is subject to special regulations, such as segregationrequirements. These special regulations can be found for instance in the European Agreementconcerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road, the International MaritimeDangerous Goods Code, the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations for air freight, and furthermoreunder the Dangerous Goods Transportation Act ( Gefahrgutbeförderungsgesetz ) in Germany, the
Hazardous Material Transportation Act in the USA or National Land Transport AgencyResolutions 5848/2019 and 5232/2017 on transport of dangerous products in Brazil. We ensurefulfillment of specific safety requirements set out by these regulations, among other thingsregarding labelling and protection measures by a specific system.
13.1.4 Health and Safety Regulations
We are subject to health and safety laws, rules and regulations not only regarding the sites we
operate but also at a given customer location, such as when we construct complete andfunctional power plants in any given country around the globe. Compliance with the applicablerequirements is paramount in order to be able to fulfill our contractual obligations vis-à-vis thecustomer.
On the international level, the United Nations SDGs, inter alia, provide a blueprint to achieve
better health and well-being standards. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“ OSH Act ”) in
the USA, the Federal Regulation on Safety and Health in the Work in Mexico (STPS) and Directive(EEC) 89/391 on the safety and health of workers at work in the European Union each promotethe improvement of the working environment to protect workers’ health and safety. Over theyears, various standards have been adopted for a number of different areas of occupationalhealth and safety in the workplace (such as work equipment, personal protective equipment,display screen equipment, the manual handling of loads and the handling of hazardoussubstances). In some countries standards are directly implemented by law or decrees of thecompetent ministries, such as in Mexico where 41 official standards on occupational safety andhealth apply. Other countries have empowered trade associations to set specific standards whichare sometimes legally binding, in particular in Germany, or non-binding but still preserved asindustry standards, in particular in the USA.
In Germany, general health and safety requirements for employees are laid down by the Working
Conditions Act ( Arbeitsschutzgesetz ), the Occupational Safety Act ( Arbeitssicherheitsgesetz ) and
the Ordinance on Industrial Safety ( Betriebssicherheitsverordnung ). For the provision and use of
working equipment, the Product Safety Act ( Produktsicherheitsgesetz ) applies, along with the
Ordinance on Health and Safety at Work ( Arbeitsstättenverordnung ) and the Ordinance on
367
Construction Sites ( Baustellenverordnung ). As regards exposure to hazardous substances, the
Ordinance on Hazardous Substances ( Gefahrstoffverordnung ) and the Technical Rules for
Hazardous Substances ( Technische Regel für Gefahrstoffe 900 ) set out limits for workplaces. We
have also obtained a permit under the Radiation Protection Act ( Strahlenschutzgesetz ) in order
to able to send our employees into nuclear facilities operated by third parties where they may beexposed to radiation of more than 1 millisievert per calendar year. All of these requirements arefurther specified by German trade associations ( Berufsgenossenschaften ) in their accident
prevention regulations ( Unfallverhütungsvorschriften ), which also address specific health and
safety risks of certain businesses such as inspection of wind power systems by SGRE.
In China, a set of health and safety regulations also applies to ensure work safety, including the
China Safety Production Law and more specific laws covering aspects of disease prevention, useof chemicals, fire prevention and special equipment safety.
We review our work safety requirements on a regular basis and aim at improving the relevant
workplace conditions and operations to reduce the risks of injuries to a minimum. We are awareof the impact that work has on health, safety and the environment. We are committed to controland mitigate this impact, for instance, by reducing the water, energy consumption and CO
2
emissions in our manufacturing processes and by offering various health and safety initiatives atour sites.
In addition to statutory regulations, all our main production facilities also comply with different
non-binding but internationally recognized standards. This includes international occupationalsafety management standards. It is anticipated that current audits will be completed in line withthe requirements of ISO 45001. These standards confirm that we anticipate and avoid risks forconsumers, make employees aware of dangers in order to reduce accidents, and educate them inenvironmentally-friendly practices (for example, reducing waste and hazardous substances).
13.1.5 Cyber Security Regulation
Most of our products, in particular grid and generation related products, form part of a greater
infrastructure that supplies the general public with electricity. In most countries this is criticalinfrastructure and therefore has to be protected against cyberattacks. Therefore, operators ofthis infrastructure are regularly obligated to take adequate organizational and technicalmeasures to avoid disruptions of their IT systems, components or processes that are essential forthe critical infrastructure’s operation. They also must ensure the availability of these systems anddata, the integrity as well as the confidentiality of processed information.
In the EU, Directive (EU) 2016/1148 on cyber security of network and information systems (“ NIS
Directive ”) proposes a wide-ranging set of measures to boost the level of security of network and
information systems to secure services vital to the EU economy and society, including providers ofessential services in critical sectors such as energy. It aims to ensure that EU countries are well-prepared and ready to handle cyberattacks in particular by the adoption of national cybersecurity strategies and obligations of essential services providers and digital service providers, toensure that they take appropriate security measures and notify the relevant national authoritiesabout serious incidents. Regulation (EU) 2019/881 on the European Union Agency forCybersecurity (“ ENISA ”) mandates ENISA to support EU member states regarding cyber security
risks and aims at the certification of several critical infrastructure sectors. A framework for EUcyber security certification for products, processes and services is currently being developed.
In Germany, the relevant framework comprises the Act on the Federal Office for Information
Security ( Gesetz über das Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik ), with specific
obligations for operators of energy supply networks and energy systems set out in the EnergyIndustry Act ( Energiewirtschaftsgesetz ) and minimum standards for cyber security contained in a
safety catalogue published by the Federal Network Agency ( Bundesnetzagentur ,“BNetzA ”)
including the implementation and certification of an information security management systemaccording to ISO/IEC 27001. Similar systems are required by the NIS Guidance Collection in the UK
368
and the standards regarding Critical Infrastructure Protection set by the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation (“ NERC ”) for Canada and the USA. China is in the process of establishing
similar provisions based on a Draft Regulation on the Protection of Critical Infrastructure.However, the Cybersecurity Law of the People’s Republic of China already requires operators ofcritical information infrastructure who purchase network products or services to sign a securityand confidentiality agreement with the respective provider clarifying duties and responsibilitiesfor security and confidentiality. Thresholds or criteria determining whether a certain installationcounts as critical infrastructure, however, vary between countries. For example, NERC’s standardfor the USA and Canada defines 75 MW as threshold for generating plants to count as criticalinfrastructure whereas the German Ordinance for the Determination of Critical Infrastructuresaccording to the Act on the Federal Office for Information Security ( BSI-Kritisverordnung ) sets a
threshold of 420 MW.
Since we regularly only manufacture products that are built into critical infrastructure or only
operate plants on behalf of our business partners, we are in most cases not directly responsibleunder the respective regulations. Indirectly, however, we must comply with cyber securityregulations to be able to develop and produce components that can safely be used in thesesystems. Accordingly some of our systems are also included under a DIN ISO/IEC 27001certification stipulating that we develop our products in a responsible manner consistent withbest practice. This aspect is also a topic in the current discussions regarding a bill on an IT SecurityAct 2.0 ( IT-Sicherheitsgesetz 2.0 ) of May 7, 2020, which is supposed to establish declarations of
trustworthiness regarding the supplier industry of operators of critical infrastructure in Germany.Other countries have already adopted specific regulations regarding the supply chain of a criticalinfrastructure. In the USA, Presidential Order No. 829 and the NERC Standard CIP-013-1 requireoperators of bulk electric systems to extend cyber security obligations to their suppliers by way ofcontract.
For the industrial control systems (“ ICS”) that we produce, like SPPA-T3000, the German Federal
Office for Information Security published (legally non-binding) recommendations for ICSmanufacturers and integrators. The German Federal Office for Information Security recommendsthe implementation of an information security management system and fulfilment of furtherrequirements that should be met during the process of planning and development of industrialcontrol systems. Similarly, in the UK operators of critical infrastructure are required to specifycyber security requirements for their suppliers.
13.2 Product Regulations
13.2.1 Design/Construction Requirements (Product Safety, Emissions, Eco-Design)
Our products are subject to requirements relating to their technical design. In particular, our
products must comply with safety requirements which are laid down in numerous acts and whichcontain both general safety requirements and requirements specific to certain products ortechnologies, hazards or impacts. This legislation also provides certain requirements relating toconformity assessment procedures and labelling of our products.
13.2.1.1 General Product Safety
Product safety encompasses the safety of all products and services that we develop, manufacture
and/or sell. They must meet applicable statutory requirements and offer state-of-the-art safety sothat they do not represent a hazard to life, health or property. In addition to our products beingtechnically safe in terms of their design, it is also essential that a preventive product safety systemis in place that governs the organization, communication, responsibilities and reporting channelsestablished to ensure product safety and a rapid, professional response in the event of safety-related problems.
In the European Union, products placed on the market must comply with all applicable
legislation (Decision (EC) 768/2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products),which is laid down in numerous acts relating to specific products. These acts mostly require the
369
manufacturer to carry out conformity assessment procedures as well. Depending on the product,
the manufacturer can choose among several conformity assessment procedures. Mostly, themanufacturer can carry out such assessment himself. However, in certain cases (for instance withregard to our pressure assembly system in power plants), the manufacturer has to involvenotified bodies. Notified bodies must be established in a member state of the European Union.As a result of the UK leaving the European Union on January 31, 2020 (“ Brexit ”), notified bodies
which are established in the UK may no longer act as notified bodies and certificates issued bythem cease to be valid for products which we have put on the market after January 31, 2020. Forthese products we must revert to another notified body established in the European Union. As aresult of Brexit there is a transitional period until December 31, 2020 in which the currentproduct-related rules continue to apply. This means that we may export our products to the UK ifthey comply with the applicable European requirements, notwithstanding the fact that theseproducts may need a certification by a notified body located in a member state of the EuropeanUnion.
In China, our products must comply, in particular, with the China Product Quality Law, according
to which industrial products that may be hazardous to health and safety shall conform to certainstandards or, in the absence of such standards, to minimum requirements for ensuring health ofthe human body and safety of lives and property. A variety of actors has adopted standards(national, regional, local standards; industry, enterprise, association standards). In general,national standards take precedence over all other standards. Voluntary standards becomebinding by reference in specific laws or regulations.
13.2.1.2 Machinery
Many of our products, such as gas and steam turbines, wind turbines, drilling rigs and hydrogen
solutions, are subject to machinery related safety legislation. In Europe this legislation is laiddown in Directive (EC) 2006/42 (the “Machinery Directive” ). Accordingly, we must design and
construct machinery so that it is fitted for its function and can be operated, adjusted andmaintained without putting persons at risk when these operations are carried out under theconditions foreseen, taking into account reasonably foreseeable misuse. When choosing technicalsolutions to fulfil these requirements, the Machinery Directive applies a three-step approach.According to this concept, the manufacturer must first eliminate or reduce risks as far as possibleby applying safe design and construction methods, second take necessary protective measures inrelation to risks that cannot be eliminated and third inform users of residual risks. In addition,the Machinery Directive requires us to design our products in such a way that risks resulting fromthe emission of airborne noise are reduced to the lowest level taking technical progress and theavailability of noise reducing methods into account.
In the U.S., the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (“ OSHA ”) has adopted
regulations on machine safety. In particular, we are required to provide one or more methods ofmachine guarding ( e.g., barrier guards, electronic safety devices) in order to protect the operator
and other employees in the machine area from hazards. In Canada, as a general rule, machinerymust be free from hazards that pose a danger to a person or property. Beyond such generalrequirements most provinces and territories have issued comprehensive safety codes applying tospecific products such as electrical components and pressure equipment (see “ 13.2.1.3 Electric
devices ” and “ 13.2.1.4 Pressure equipment ” below). In Brazil, the Regulatory Standards ( Norma
Regulamentadora ,“NR”) set minimum requirements regarding the safety of specific products.
The general standard NR 12 on machinery and work equipment safety requires that industrialmachinery be free from recognized hazards likely to endanger health and physical integrity ofemployees and designed to prevent accidents despite potential defects (fail safe principle).
13.2.1.3 Electric devices
Some parts of power transformers and other electronic devices we manufacture are subject to
requirements of Directive (EU) 2014/35 on electrical equipment designed for use within certainvoltage limits (Low Voltage Directive). This directive requires manufacturers to avoid
370
endangering health and safety of persons, domestic animals and property when electrical
equipment is installed, maintained and used. Thus we must employ technical measures to protectpersons and domestic animals (i) from hazards resulting from the electrical equipment ( e.g.,
arising through contact with the equipment or from certain temperatures, arcs or radiation) and(ii) against hazards which may be caused by external influences on the electrical equipment.
In the U.S., the electrical components we produce require approval by recognized testing
laboratories (29 CFR Part 1910). Electric equipment must generally be free from recognizedhazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees, taking into account,among others, the mechanical strength and heating effects under all conditions of use. Inaddition, state governments and local authorities have adopted as law the National ElectricalCode (“ NEC”). The NEC covers the installation of electrical products for public or private use and
requires that certain electrical products ( e.g., wires, cabinets and switches) meet the
requirements of specific standards. In particular, according to the NEC all electrical componentsmust be listed, labelled or approved for installation.
In Canada, electrical components have to be compliant with the Electrical Code of the Canadian
Standards Association (“ CSA”) (CSA C22.1-18) as implemented and amended by respective
provincial or territorial legislation. In particular any deviation from the standards laid downrequires governmental authorization.
In Brazil, electrical components have to comply with the specific national standard NR 10.
Notably, they shall be designed to have overvoltage protection and discharging mechanisms.Some components, especially those used in fire sensitive surroundings and explosiveatmospheres, require certification by nationally recognized testing laboratories. Such approvalinvolves determining whether the product meets the requirements of applicable safety standardsimposed by the National Institute of Metrology, Standardization and Industrial Quality ( Instituto
Nacional de Metrologia, Qualidade e Tecnologia ).
13.2.1.4 Pressure equipment
Our business also involves the delivery of assemblies which are covered, in Europe, by Directive
(EU) 2014/68 relating to pressure equipment (“ PED”). Typical assemblies we deliver to our
customers include, depending on design and application, steam generators (unfired, fired),power piping, heat exchangers, pressure vessels, condensers, tanks, unpressurized vessels and airreceivers. As manufacturer of these products we are obliged to fulfil the requirements of thePED. The PED stipulates essential safety requirements relating to the design, manufacturing andmaterials used for the manufacture of pressure equipment in the PED’s scope. For some productsthat we manufacture, like steam generators, the PED stipulates additional requirements andrequires us to calculate, design and construct such products to avoid or minimize risks of asignificant loss of containment from overheating. Moreover, the PED stipulates specificcertification requirements which may require us to involve notified bodies.
In the U.S., the OSHA has defined a number of regulations which apply, among other things to
certain hydrogen containers and air receivers. The OSHA regulations refer to standards adoptedby the American Society of Mechanical Engineers covering the construction of pressure vessels. Inaddition the OSH Act requires employers to provide a place of employment free from recognizedhazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to their employees. According toan interpretation letter from the OSHA this obligation may also apply to pressure vessels used foroil and gas extraction.
In Canada, pressure vessels are subject to prior registration or authorization pursuant to local
legislation. The process includes disclosure of information on design, calculations and otherdetails. The authorities determine whether the product meets the requirements of applicablesafety standards imposed by the CSA and the American Standards Institute. In particular, thepressure equipment must be constructed to prevent unintentional release of contained fluid andso that integrity assessments to determine its condition may be carried out. In China, the Law onthe Safety of Special Equipment requires that certain of our boilers, pressure vessels and pressure
371
piping elements be certified under a product certification scheme administered by the Special
Equipment Licensing Office of the State Administration for Market Regulation. In Brazil, boilersand pressure vessels have to meet the additional standards described in NR 13. In particular, ahydrostatic test has to be conducted.
13.2.1.5 Electromagnetic compatibility
Our power transformers, wind turbines and other electric gear are also subject to requirements
relating to electromagnetic compatibility. In Europe, these are laid down in Directive (EU)2014/30, according to which manufacturers must design and manufacture equipment to ensure(i) that electromagnetic disturbance generated by equipment does not exceed the level abovewhich other equipment cannot operate as intended and (ii) that equipment is sufficientlyimmune to electromagnetic disturbance created by other equipment. Thereby the manufacturermust respect the state of the art. Fixed installations are subject to an additional requirement thatthey be installed applying good engineering practices. The Federal Communications Commissionregulates the electromagnetic compatibility of products in the U.S. and has, to that end,published a number of regulations (47 CFR Part 15). Our products must, in particular, beauthorized prior to initiation of marketing and must comply with specific limits for the emissionof electromagnetic radiation.
13.2.1.6 Explosive atmospheres
Some of our products constitute or are used in potentially explosive atmospheres, such as
hydrogen-based cooling systems, compressors and compressor strings, and industrial steamturbines. In Europe, Directive (EU) 2014/34 relating to equipment and protective systemsintended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres stipulates specific safety requirements forthese products. In particular we must, (i) if possible, prevent the formation of explosiveatmospheres which may be produced or released by equipment and by protective systemsthemselves, (ii) prevent the ignition of explosive atmospheres and (iii) take measures to haltimmediately or to limit the effects of explosions which may occur despite the steps taken under(i) and (ii). In the U.S., the NEC also contains rules relating to equipment for use in explosiveatmospheres while in Canada such rules are found in the Canadian Electrical Code (see“13.2.1.3 Electric devices ” above).
13.2.1.7 Eco-design requirements
Some of our products are also subject to eco-design requirements and legislation which generally
aims at reducing the ecological footprint of products. One aspect of this is to improve energyefficiency of energy-using appliances, thereby contributing to lower CO
2emissions. In Europe,
Directive (EC) 2009/125 and other legislation oblige manufacturers to consider eco-designrequirements at every stage of a product’s life cycle (raw materials, manufacturing, packaging,distribution, installation, maintenance, use and end-of life). For certain power transformers weproduce, Regulation (EU) 548/2014 stipulates specific requirements relating to minimum energyperformance and energy efficiency requirements (namely maximum load losses and maximumno-load losses). In China, the Energy Conservation Law promotes the improvement of energyefficiency of all aspects of society to reduce electricity consumption. In Brazil, Decree No. 9.864 ofJune 27, 2019 implements the National Policy for the Conservation and Rational Use of Energyestablished in Law No. 10.295 of October 17, 2001. It sets maximum levels of energy consumptionand minimum energy efficiency requirements for machines.
13.2.1.8 Construction products
Regulation (EU) 302/2011 on construction products applies to certain products which will be
incorporated in a permanent manner in construction works. These must fulfil essentialcharacteristics laid down in harmonized technical rules. In addition, we must declare that ourproducts conform to this regulation and the relevant technical rules, and also that our productshave certain constancy of conformance with these requirements. Depending on the product, wemay give such declarations ourselves or we must revert to notified bodies. This applies to certain
372
cables that we produce which are subject to technical requirements relating to their behavior
during fire. In addition, there are technical requirements which are relevant for chimneys that webuild when we deliver power plants as turnkey projects.
13.2.2 Regulation of Product Content and Components
Certain chemicals and other contents of our products are subject to laws and regulations
governing their use, packaging, transport and disposal. In addition we are under certainobligations to notify our customers of such contents in our products.
In the European Union, the REACH Regulation provides a comprehensive legislative framework
for the manufacture and use of chemicals. It requires registration with the European ChemicalsAgency of all chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the European Union inquantities of more than one ton per annum. If there is no (pre) registration of the substance it isimpermissible to produce this chemical in the European Union, to import or to use it ( i.e., “no
data no market” principle). For substances that have been added to Annex XIV of the REACHRegulation, an authorization is required to continuously use them after the so-called “sunsetdate” and it is uncertain whether the authorities will provide such authorization. In addition, theuse of substances listed in Annex XIV of the REACH Regulation may be restricted in the future byinclusion of these substances in Annex XVII of the REACH Regulation. Also, substances of veryhigh concern (“ SVHC ”) may be listed on a so-called “candidate list” (“ SVHC list ”). The SVHC list
contains substances for potential inclusion into the list of Annex XIV of the REACH Regulation.We use anhydrides as a hardening agent in the production of many of our components forelectric systems which we produce from cast resin ( e.g., generator components, cast resin
transformers, isolators and bushings). Anhydrides have recently been included in the SVHC list.We must inform recipients pro-actively if our products contain SVHC with a concentration of≥0.1% weight by weight. Under certain circumstances a notification to the European Chemicals
Agency is also required. Further restrictions are found in national rules like in the GermanChemicals Prohibition Ordinance ( Chemikalien-Verbotsverordnung) .
Our product line also includes air and gas-insulated switchgear which is often built into
substations or wind turbines. The insulation gas used is SF
6, which is a GHG. As of the date of this
Prospectus, no legal restrictions apply for the use of SF6in our switchgear. Public debate on this
matter includes a potential ban of the use of SF6, which would prohibit us from using it in our
products in some countries or in general in the future. In light of this public debate, we havepro-actively developed a product line which does not require the use of SF
6(Blue Portfolio). This
portfolio allows us to modernize and expand existing power grids in line with increased levels ofsafety. Many of our products, such as gear units, contain oil as cooling and lubricating agent. Inaddition, certain of the fire extinguishing systems we produce use CO
2as fire extinguishing
agent. These and other substances are considered dangerous under the CLP Regulation and weare therefore subject to certain obligations with regard to their classification, labelling andpackaging. In addition, we must provide to our customers adequate safety data sheets.
In the U.S., the TSCA is the primary chemicals management law. It requires EPA to undertake risk
evaluations for chemicals made or used within the U.S. which are new or already listed in thechemical substances inventory. For new chemicals, the TSCA requires manufacturers andprocessors to notify EPA 90 days before beginning to manufacture or process such chemicalsubstance. The purpose of EPA’s review is to determine whether a chemical substance presents anunreasonable risk to health or the environment. If, in EPA’s view, a chemical substance presentsan unreasonable risk, EPA must propose rules to manage the risk, such as limiting or prohibitingthe manufacture or distribution of the chemical substance. In addition, we must immediatelyinform EPA, if we obtain information that the substance or mixture may present a substantial riskof injury to health or the environment.
13.2.3 Circular Economy
Our products are subject to general considerations of circular economy. In addition, our wind
turbines and transformers may in the future be subject to additional (specific) designrequirements with a view to ensuring efficient use of resources and avoidance of waste.
373
In the European Union, the EU Commission published in 2015 its Circular Economy Action plan
which aims at facilitating a transition towards a more sustainable model for economicdevelopment. The action plan concerns circular economy over the entire life cycle of a product,including the production phase, by proposing several initiatives and regulatory actions as well asby identifying certain priority sectors. In 2019, the EU Commission published its Final CircularEconomy Package summarizing the actions taken or envisaged in implementing the 2015 actionplan. In 2020, the EU Commission published its New Circular Economy Action Plan which putsemphasis on the roll out of a product policy framework to reduce waste and to ensure that theEuropean Union has a well-functioning internal market for high quality secondary raw materials.In particular the EU Commission is planning to examine whether the European Union shoulddevelop specific eco-design requirements for wind turbines. With such requirements, the EUCommission aims at ensuring a circular economy of neodymium and other materials which theEuropean Union considers as critical raw materials and which the EU Commission expects will beused in larger wind turbines in the future.
In addition, the European Union updated its Waste Framework Directive (Directive (EC) 2008/98)
in 2018 and obliged member states to manage waste containing significant amounts of criticalraw materials to the best extent possible (see “ 13.1.3.4 Waste Production and Management”
above ).This includes preventing that products which are the main sources of critical raw
materials become waste. Member states must implement the updated Directive into theirnational laws by July 5, 2020. In Germany, the Federal Government has published a draft law totranspose the updated Waste Management Directive into national law. As of the date of thisProspectus, the legislative procedure is ongoing. The draft envisages obligations for producers ofcertain products to pay for the products’ recycling and further obligations to strengthenproducer responsibility. The German government can issue regulations to define the types ofproducts to which these obligations apply. Our wind turbines consist of rotor blades made ofcarbon-reinforced material which must be recycled in specific facilities after use. Although therehas been a political debate in Germany to oblige manufacturers of wind turbines or rotor bladesused therein to pay for the recycling of the blades, as of the date of this Prospectus the Germangovernment has not yet made a specific legislative proposal on this. France recently enacted arule ( arrêté du 22 juin 2020 portant modification des prescriptions relatives aux installations de
production d’électricité utilisant l’énergie mécanique du vent au sein d’une installation soumise àautorisation au titre de la rubrique 2980 de la législation des installations classées pour laprotection de l’environnement ) stipulating stringent requirements for the recycling of existing
and the recyclability of new wind turbines, which are phased-in from July 1, 2020. In general,rules on the recycling of wind turbines affect our products and design processes because we mustdesign our products in a way that allows our customers to fulfil their recycling obligations.
In China, the Circular Economy Promotion Law stipulates general requirements for reduction,
reuse and recycling. In particular when we design products, we are obliged to make prior use ofmaterials and designing schemes which allow the products to be recycled. With respect to certainelectric and electronic products we may not use certain toxic and harmful substances asprohibited by the State.
In Brazil, Federal Law 12305/2010 establishes the National Solid Waste Policy which aims to
provide integrated and environmentally sound management of solid waste. This policy stipulatesthe principle of joint responsibility of all agents involved in the life cycle of a product ( e.g.,
manufacturers, importers, retailers, public authorities). Therefore, they must minimize thevolume of solid waste and adopt practices to ensure that products are reintegrated into theproduction cycle.
13.3 Regulations Applicable to Our Customers’ Operations
When using the products we produce, our customers are subject to a number of obligationsresulting from laws, regulations and technical specifications, which relate to things like pollutantor noise emissions, protection of soil and water, and dismantling/decommissioning. Suchrequirements influence the way we design our products because our customers expect us todeliver products fit to fulfil their obligations.
374
13.3.1 Technical Requirements
Our customers use the HVDC systems we produce to connect energy generating facilities to the
electricity grid. In addition they connect the gas/steam/wind turbines we produce to theelectricity grid. Typically grid codes or similar regulations around the globe set technicalparameters that any facility connected to an electricity grid must fulfill in order to ensure safeand reliable operation of the electricity grid. In particular, grid codes define parameters relatingto a facility’s active and reactive power supply and its characteristics during grid failures. Theserequirements must usually be fulfilled at the grid connection point. In Europe, grid operators andthe EU Commission defined such rules for generators (Regulation (EU) 2016/631) as well as forHVDC systems and DC-connected power park modules (Regulation (EU) 2016/1447). Similarly inMexico high-voltage products including power generation equipment have to fulfil specificationsissued by public companies (CFE and PEMEX) but we expect that these will be regulated by thegovernment in the future.
13.3.2 Air Emission Legislation
Although legal requirements vary from country to country, all of the power plants that we build
for our customers using fossil fuel, gas and steam turbines have to comply with certain qualityrequirements or technical specifications to be eligible for operation under applicable local laws.This particularly concerns emission limits for all relevant airborne pollutants resulting from thecombustion process. In addition, certain installations like power plants are subjects toenvironmental impact assessments in order to identify their impact for the surroundings. Thismay result in emission protection requirements which may include fitting of catalysts for CO, NOxand NH
3emissions or other measures.
In the European Union, Directive (EU) 2010/75 on industrial emissions (“ IED”) aims at reducing
pollution from industrial activities, including energy generation. The IED contains emission limitsfor certain combustion plants. In addition, the IED requires operators of power plants to be inpossession of a valid permit for their operation and prevent and reduce pollution by applying thebest available techniques (“ BATs ”). The EU Commission develops reference documents on best
available techniques (“ BREFs ”) and adopts key elements of the BREFs as “ BAT conclusions ”. The
BAT conclusions contain emission limits associated with the best available techniques. For largecombustion plants, the EU Commission adopted BAT conclusions in 2017 which were publishedon August 17, 2017. These BAT conclusions stipulate emission requirements for among otherthings dust, Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury which are mostly stricter than currentemission limits. This may require operators to adjust their facilities which in turn require us toupdate our product portfolio so that we can supply service products.
Germany has transposed the IED Directive in the BImSchG and implementing ordinances as well
as administrative guidelines. The implementing ordinances provide emission thresholds,authorization requirements and supervisory obligations for new and existing facilities. Since thisobligation is dynamic in nature even already licensed installations may require retrofittingmeasures or other measures in order to comply with new standards. A draft bill to transpose thelatest BAT conclusions relating to large combustion plants in the legal framework ( 13. BImSchV )
was published on June 25, 2020. In addition, in 2019, Germany adopted registration requirementsand emission standards ( e.g., relating to dust and Sulphur dioxide) for medium sized combustion
plants (44. BImSchV ).
In the USA, most of the air emission requirements at the federal level are implemented through
programs under the CAA. The CAA programs that are most relevant to our business andoperations are the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“ NESHAP ”) and the
National Air Quality Standards (“ NAAQS ”). The NESHAP regulates the emissions by stationary
sources, including power plants, of 187 hazardous air pollutants (“ HAP”). Under the CAA, EPA
has set NAAQS for the following six “criteria” pollutants considered harmful to public health andthe environment: carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, Sulphur dioxide, ground-level ozone,particulate matter and lead. The CAA identifies two types of national ambient air qualitystandards for each of these criteria pollutants. Primary standards provide public health
375
protection, including protecting the health of “sensitive” populations such as asthmatics, children
and the elderly. Secondary standards provide public welfare protection, including protectionagainst decreased visibility and damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and buildings. Ageographic area that meets or does better than the NAAQS is called an attainment area, while anarea that does not meet this standard is called a nonattainment area. Once these designationstake effect, state governments must develop state implementation plans outlining how the statewill attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. A nonattainment areadesignation results in the application of more stringent requirements applicable to current andnew industrial operations, such as requirements to install pollution control equipment.
In China, the Law on Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution (“ Air Quality Act ”) is the
primary law dealing with air pollution, providing comprehensive measures of air pollutionprevention and control. The Air Quality Act sets a specific goal of improving air quality andemphasizes the control of air pollution caused, among others, by industrial production. TheChinese authorities have issued the Integrated Emission Standards of Air Pollutants in order toimplement the general provisions of the Air Quality Act. These standards specify emission limitsof 33 air pollutants and define specific emission standards for, among others, boilers andthermal-power stations. In addition, the Regulation on Pollution Discharge Permitting requirescertain companies to obtain and comply with a pollution discharge permit for air emissions. Localauthorities are encouraged to establish more stringent emission standards. Furthermore,industrial facilities must obtain a pollutant discharge permit for the emission of specifiedhazardous and toxic atmospheric pollutants.
In Brazil, our customers must comply with the standards adopted by CONAMA as well as the
emission limits adopted by the federal states. In particular, Resolution 8/90 of December 6, 1990,establishes maximum levels for air pollutants originating from external combustion processes onstationary sites. Resolution 382/06 of December 26, 2006 sets maximum levels of air pollutionemissions from point sources.
In Mexico, LGEEPA also includes regulations on air-borne pollutants. At the federal level, these
regulations are complemented by Official Mexican Standards ( Norma Oficial Mexicana ,“NOM ”).
Regarding the fossil fuel power plants as well as the gas and steam turbines that we build, ourcustomers must, in particular, comply with the NOM-085-SEMARNAT-2011 for combustion plants.This standard will, however, be replaced by the new NOM-168-SEMARNAT-ASEA-2016 that will,among others, establish maximum emission levels for gas turbines.
13.3.3 Noise Emission Legislation
Wind turbines, DC transformers, power plants based on fossil fuels and further products we
produce are subject to noise emission limits during their operation. In addition, authorities mayimpose certain noise reduction obligations which take local surroundings into consideration.
Noise emission levels relating to the operation of sites in which our customers use our products
(for noise requirements relating to product design, see “ 13.2.1 Design/Construction Requirements
(Product Safety, Emissions, Eco-Design) ” above), are mainly determined at local level. In
Germany, the Technical Guidelines Noise (“ TA Lärm ”) set maximum noise emission limits for
installations depending on the area and time in which they are operated. In the futureauthorities may stipulate stricter noise emission limits even for facilities already in operation. Thismay require retrofitting measures, i.e., delivering components or carrying out construction or
other works. In China, noise emissions are governed by the Law on the Prevention and Control ofEnvironmental Noise Pollution (“ Environmental Noise Act ”) and implementing noise emission
standards. Under the Environmental Noise Act, facilities causing noise emissions must takemeasures for eliminating and controlling such emissions. In Brazil, CONAMA Resolution 1/90 ofMarch 8, 1990 comprehensively regulates noise emission in industrial and private context.
13.3.4 Further Environmental Law (Water Law, Dismantling Obligations)
In the course of their operations our customers are subject to additional requirements under
environmental law, pertaining to things like the use and the protection of water as well
376
decommissioning/dismantling of their installations after cessation of use. Our customers expect
us to supply components and installations with which they can fulfil their obligations.
Our customers use water, which they extract from and feed-in to rivers, canals and other sources,
to cool the power plants we produce. Permit requirements, emission limits and furtherobligations apply to such activities. On EU level, the IED and BAT conclusions ( e.g., relating to
large combustion plants) stipulate certain maximum levels for pollutants in water. In Germany,the abstraction of water and the feed-in of used water into water bodies are subject to a permitunder the WHG. According to the WHG, the feed-in of water is only permissible if the amountand harmfulness of the water is as low as possible according to current state of the art.Regulations adopted under the WHG define state of the art for wastewater of a number ofindustry areas. In Brazil, the National Policy on Water Resources as well as certain resolutions bythe CONAMA require our customers to respect certain standards and be in possession of a permitfor the discharge of effluents and for water collection from rivers or wells. In China, the Law onthe Prevention and Control of Water Pollution and the Regulation on Pollution DischargePermitting requires our customers to obtain a wastewater discharge permit for the discharge ofindustrial water. In addition, these rules establish national standards for the discharge of waterpollutants. Local authorities are invited to adopt more stringent standards than the nationalstandards.
In addition, almost all turbines we produce contain oil or other substances which are hazardous
to water. Although there are differences in national legislation, our customers are generallyobliged to adopt precautionary measures to avoid contamination of water and to remedycontaminations if they do occur nevertheless. If our customers are obliged to carry outremediation work, they may seek compensation from us if a defect in the products we delivercaused the contamination. Similar principles apply if our customers cause soil pollution.
Our customers are also subject to decommissioning and dismantling obligations, for instance
relating to their wind turbines and fossil or nuclear power plants. These obligations varyaccording to the product concerned and the country in which it is located. In Germany, theAtomic Energy Act ( Atomgesetz ) requires operators of nuclear power plants to decommission
their plants after they cease their operations. Also operators of other power plants, such as windturbines, can be obligated to carry out decommissioning through ancillary conditions in permits,like under the BImSchG. Such conditions are regularly included, in particular, if the plant wasconstructed in certain protected areas. Operators must decommission offshore wind turbineswhen they ceased their operations for more than three years or if their planning permissionexpires. Regarding decommissioning of nuclear power plants, obligations similar to German lawalso apply in Sweden and France ( démantèlement ). In the U.S., operators of nuclear power plants
have to provide sufficient funding for decommissioning and offer different ways on how todecommission a nuclear power plant within 60 years. Apart from this, decommissioningrequirements regarding wind power plants and other energy related installations vary from stateto state. While some states in the U.S. impose strict requirements and/or request financial suretiesfor decommissioning, others leave decommissioning to be regulated on a municipal level or inprivate (lease) contracts.
13.4 Market-related Energy and Climate Policies and Regulations
Our production process and our products are particularly influenced by trends and developmentsin energy and climate policies and regulations, particularly because such policies can create ornarrow markets or shape customer demands for particular technologies, products and servicesprovided by us across the entire energy value chain. Although this applies to each and everycountry around the globe, the EU, North American and Chinese markets are the most importantmarkets not only in terms of volume but also as examples for different policies.
13.4.1 European Union and UK
In European markets, we observe three closely interlinked regulation trends. Driven by political
policies, regulation to achieve climate neutrality has recently increased, with a particular focus on
377
a decline of fossil-based electricity generation such as in our coal or gas-fired power plants. In
turn, renewable energy sources (“ RES”) expand, combined with technical progress and
technology-specific as well as technology-neutral competition in the RES sector. This particularlyaffects SGRE’s onshore and offshore wind power generation activities. Finally, the overall REStrend requires the grid infrastructure to adapt to the increased feed-in from RES on both thetransmission and distribution level as well as to long-distance transmission between generationand load centers.
13.4.1.1 Climate Neutrality and Decarbonization
Our fossil-fired energy generation as well as oil and gas infrastructure business are particularly
affected by policies and regulations aiming at climate neutrality, i.e., by way of decarbonization.
European Green Deal
Based on a communication from the EU Commission (COM(2019) 640 final), the “ European Green
Deal ”, the EU shall achieve climate neutrality by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement. The
European Green Deal sets out a net-zero GHG emission economy by 2050, defines targets forphasing out coal and decarbonizing gas, envisages a clean and circular economy and increasedenergy performance of buildings, and includes a shift to sustainable and smart mobility. At theend of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, the European Council and all EU member states, exceptPoland, as well as the European Parliament endorsed this concept. In January 2020, the EUCommission presented an Investment Plan for a Sustainable Europe (COM(2020) 21 final) tomobilize at least €1 trillion of sustainable investments over the next decade. On March 4, 2020,
the EU Commission proposed a regulation establishing the framework for achieving climateneutrality (COM/2020/80 final) to implement this concept, the “ European Climate Law ”. This shall
empower the EU Commission to adopt a 2030-2050 EU-wide trajectory for GHG emissionreductions by delegated acts and to assess the consistency of EU and national measures with theEU’s climate neutrality objective every five years. This EU strategy will likely lead to a phase-outof fossil-based energy generation, especially coal-fired power plants. Furthermore, on May 27,2020, the EU Commission presented a proposal for a new European major recovery package,which also commits to rolling out renewable energy projects, especially wind, solar and cleanhydrogen. Another component of the European Green Deal is the hydrogen strategy for aclimate-neutral Europe, which the EU Commission presented on July 8, 2020 (COM(2020) 301final). This EU strategy shall contribute to the decarbonization of industrial processes andeconomic sectors where reducing carbon emissions is difficult to achieve by utilizing carboncapture technologies as an interim solution for the production of hydrogen (blue hydrogen) untilsufficient renewable energy sources are available to produce clean hydrogen (green hydrogen).Similar strategies are in parallel being established at member state level, like the Germannational hydrogen strategy of June 2020.
2030 Climate and Energy Framework
For the period from 2021 to 2030, the 2030 Climate and Energy Framework (“ 2030
Framework ”) applies. This policy is based on a communication from the EU Commission
(COM(2014) 15 final) that was adopted by the European Council in October 2014 (EUCO169/14). It aims at a reduction of GHG emissions in the EU by at least 40% compared to 1990,an increase of energy efficiency by at least 32.5% as well as an increase of RES in final energyconsumption to at least 32% (“ EU 2030 Targets ”). The initial 27% RES and energy efficiency
targets were revised upwards in the course of the recast of the Renewable Energy Directive(EU) 2018/2001 (“ RED II ”). To meet these targets, the EU, inter alia , revised the EU ETS and
adopted Regulation (EU) 2018/842 on binding annual GHG emission reductions by member
states for 2021 to 2030 (“ European Climate Protection Regulation ”). The latter requires
minimum contributions of the member states during that period, although the specific GHG
emission reduction targets vary between 0% and 40% compared to 2005 levels. Member statesexceeding their emission targets may purchase e mission allowances from other member states
to offset their deficit. Germany, for example, shall achieve a GHG reduction of 38% by 2030
378
compared to 2005. As part of the European Green Deal, the EU Commission aims to propose
raising the EU 2030 targets to at least 50% and even 55% in a responsible way.
Clean Energy Package
In 2019, the EU completed a comprehensive update of its energy policy framework on climate
neutrality and decarbonization objectives. The so-called “Clean Energy for all EuropeansPackage” is based on proposals of the EU Commission published in November 2016 and consistsof a total of eight legislative acts, including, in particular, the RED II and the Second Regulation(EU) 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity (“ EMR II ”).
RED II raises the overall EU binding target for RES final consumption by 2030 to at least 32%. The
national contributions set by member states in integrated national energy and climate plans for aperiod of ten years must meet this target collectively. The gross final consumption of energyfrom RES in each member state will be calculated as the sum of the gross final consumption fromRES in the energy and the heating and cooling sector as well as the final consumption of RES inthe transport sector. In order to promote the use of renewable energy in the transport sector,each member state shall set an obligation on fuel suppliers to ensure that the share of renewableenergy within the final consumption of energy in the transport sector is at least 14% by 2030.Member states must also adopt national policies that aim to develop the market for alternativetransport fuels and infrastructure, including recharging stations. The requirements of RED II haveto be transposed into national law until June 30, 2021,
The EMR II focusses on requirements for capacity markets where power plant operators are not
only paid for the production of electricity but also for the potential production of electricity(reserve power). It sets out conditions and limits particularly regarding the future use of fossiltechnology. Capacity mechanisms should be temporary and designed to address and identifyproblems of resource adequacy. Under EMR II, energy generation facilities emitting more than550 g of fossil CO
2per kWh and an average of 350 kg of CO2per year per kW installed will not be
able to participate in capacity mechanisms after June 2025. Thus, power plants that haveparticipated in the capacity reserve may no longer participate in capacity market mechanisms.EMR II further requires member states to review and, if necessary, adjust their bidding zones toensure market liquidity, efficient congestion management and overall market efficiency. Anyadjustments to the bidding zones might also affect existing capacity mechanisms by reducingdemand for capacity.
EU Taxonomy
Financing mechanisms set out further incentives for the phase-out of fossil-fuel power
generation. Based on a proposal from the EU Commission (COM(2018) 353 final), in December2019 the European Council and the European Parliament reached a political agreement on aproposed Regulation on the Establishment of a Framework to Facilitate Sustainable Investment(Council Doc. 14970/19), the so–called “ EU Taxonomy ”, which in turn was adopted by the
European Council (Council Doc. 5639/20) on April 15, 2020 and by the European Parliament onJune 18, 2020. From December 2021 onwards, the EU Taxonomy shall implement a classificationsystem at EU level to define environmentally sustainable economic activities. One objective is toredirect capital flows towards sustainable investment by setting out requirements for financialmarket participants in relation to the disclosure of sustainability risks and impacts of financialproducts. An overarching, technology-neutral emission threshold of 100 g CO
2emissions per kWh
is proposed for electricity generation. This threshold will be reduced every five years in line witha trajectory to net-zero CO
2emissions in 2050. We expect that the EU Taxonomy will make the
financing of new fossil fuel energy projects, even high-efficient gas fired power plants, moredifficult. Already by now, the EIB’s lending policy stipulates that from 2021 onwards no newfinancing will be granted to fossil fuel projects, including gas-fired power plants, and that the EIBwill increasingly promote low or zero emission technologies and decentralized energyproduction, aiming to meet the EU’s 32% RES target. In addition, EU Taxonomy will require us to
379
provide additional information on how and to what extent our activities are associated with
economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under EU Taxonomy in our annualreport.
Climate Protection Laws
There are additional laws and regulations at EU member state level which also aim at climate
neutrality and decarbonization. For example, the German Climate Protection Law ( Bundes-
Klimaschutzgesetz ), adopted in November 2019, stipulates legally binding GHG emission targets
for various sectors. In the energy sector, GHG emissions must decrease from 280 million tons CO
2
in 2020 to 175 million tons CO2in 2030; in the industrial production sector from 186 million tons
in 2020 to 140 million tons CO2in 2030. However, the precise implementation of these targets is
still subject to further legislation.
In November 2019, the French Parliament adopted the Energy and Climate Law ( Loi n° 2019-1147
du 8 novembre 2019 relative à l’énergie et au climat ). In addition to its national reduction target
in non-EU ETS sectors set by EU law, this law requires a further reduction of fossil fuelconsumption by 40% by 2030 compared to 2012 and achievement of the long-term target ofcarbon neutrality by 2050.
Furthermore, the British Climate Change Act of 2008, as amended in June 2019, sets a net-zero
GHG emission reduction target by 2050 compared to 1990 levels as well as legally binding carbonbudgets. This act requires the UK government to set legally binding carbon budgets, as of thedate of this Prospectus providing for a GHG emission reduction of 51% in 2025 and of 57% in2030.
Phase-out of Coal-fired Power Generation
Further laws at EU member state level provide for a definite phase-out of coal-fired power
generation, however, with varying time schedules. In Germany, the Coal Exit Law(Kohleverstromungsbeendigungsgesetz ,“KVBG ”) of August 8, 2020, sets a shutdown schedule
for lignite power, including a total of €4.35 billion of compensation. For hard coal the bill
foresees a tender procedure for compensation payments to incentivize operators to take capacityoff the grid until 2026. The first auction will still take place in 2020 and take 4 GW of hard coal-fired power generation off the grid at a maximum remuneration of €165,000 per MW.
Subsequent auctions will follow until 2026 at degressive remuneration rates. From 2027 onwards,the hard coal phase-out shall be subject to forced shutdowns. By 2022, the share of coal-firedpower generation from hard coal and lignite-fired power plants shall be reduced to around 15GW each. By 2030, further reductions to around eight GW are planned for hard coal-fired powerplants and nine GW for lignite-fired power plants. The overall phase-out of coal-fired powergeneration shall be completed by 2038 at the latest. Other member states have scheduled aneven faster phase-out. For example, the French coal-fired power generation phase-out plan(Stratégie Nationale Bas-Carbone ) as adopted by French Parliament in 2015 will lead to a
shutdown of the remaining four coal-fired power plants in France by 2022.
Under an Implementation Plan on the End of Unabated Coal by 2025 of January 2018, the UK
government plans to set an emission limit of 450g of carbon per kWh on coal-fired powergenerators from October 1, 2025 resulting in a de facto phase-out.
Emission Thresholds and Trading
In addition to laws and regulations that directly lead to a phase-out of fossil-based power
generation, further policies incentivize the decrease and shut-down of carbon generation. Forexample, the IED aims to reduce harmful industrial emissions by requiring industrial installationsto meet emission values for certain pollutants based on BAT as published by the EU Commissionin the BREFs. We expect these standards will become more stringent and comprehensive overtime and therefore we must adapt our products as well as our production sites accordingly.
Another important instrument is the EU ETS, which implemented a market to trade a capped
number of EUAs for companies operating within the European Economic Area (“ EEA”).
380
Operators of energy-intensive installations (power generation facilities and industrial plants)
must buy and sell those allowances in order to cover their emissions. The European Unionannually reduces the available allowances, in order to increase their prices and create incentivesto reduce CO
2emission. The overall number of EUAs shall further decline at an annual rate of
2.2% (linear reduction factor) from 2021 onwards, compared to 1.74% currently. The economicviability and competitiveness of our power generation products depend, inter alia , on the price
of the EUAs, which is volatile and therefore not predictable due to its dependence on thecap-and-trade scheme. To counteract the volatility of the EU ETS and to improve its stability, theEuropean Union established a market stability reserve in 2019 (Decision (EU) 2015/1814),providing an automatic adjustment of the supply of auctioned allowances by reducing thesurplus or counteracting a shortage. It therefore improves the EU ETS’ resilience to market shocksand enhances market stability.
Carbon Tax
In addition to the EU ETS, some member states imposed further national regulations to promote
the reduction of GHG emissions by increasing their costs through taxes and charges in order toreach the targets defined by the European Climate Protection Regulation.
For example, the German Fuel Trading Act ( Brennstoffemissionshandelsgesetz ,“BEHG ”) of 2019
implemented a national emission trading system. From 2021 onwards, companies placing fossilfuels on the market are obliged to acquire emission allowances for the GHG emissions caused bytheir products. The BEHG is supposed to increase the prices for petrol and heating oil, but willalso increase the market prices for all products that depend on the use of fossil fuels. Exemptions,however, apply for industrial sectors covered by the EU ETS in order to avoid double taxation.Under a bill amending the BEHG, the price per ton CO
2shall increase to initially €25 and then
gradually rise to €55 in 2025. For the year 2026, a price corridor of at least €55 and at most
€65 shall apply.
In France, the climate energy contribution ( contribution climat énergie ,“CCE”), introduced by
the French Finance Law ( Loi n° 2013-1278 de finances ) in 2014, sets an annually increasing
indirect CO2price component by adding a surcharge to existing taxes on fossil fuels, initially at
€7 per ton of CO2. The surcharge is paid when purchasing fossil fuels. In 2018, the CO2surcharge
in France was around €45 and by January 2019 it should have risen to €55. However, due to
continued protests, France paused the increase in 2019. Sectors covered by the EU ETS areexempted from the surcharge.
The UK implemented an additional Climate Change Levy (“ CCL”), which taxes the use of coal and
other solid fossil fuels for energy generation via carbon price support rates set out in the CarbonPrice Floor (“ CPF”), introduced in 2013. The CPF supplements the EU ETS by topping up the EUA’s
price ( Carbon Support Price, “CPS”). Until 2021, the CPS component of the floor price is capped at
a maximum of around €22 per ton of CO
2. Industrial energy consumers, however, must pay the
CCL main rates on electricity, gas or solid fuels.
CHP Technology and Nuclear Power Plants
Regarding CHP plants, the market development is highly dependent on different national
support schemes. The German Heat and Power Cogeneration Act(Kraft-Wärme-Kopplungsgesetz ,“KWKG 2019 ”) provides for financial incentives for operators of
new, modernized or retrofitted CHP, except coal and lignite-fired CHP. It also supports theconstruction and expansion of energy-efficient district heating/cooling networks as well as theconstruction and retrofitting of heating/cooling storage facilities. An amendment to the KWKG2019 passed alongside the KVBG shall create incentives to replace coal-fired CHP with modernCHP systems.
Our products such as steam turbines and power plant control technologies can partially be used
in nuclear power plants and we observe that EU member states handle the phase out fromnuclear energy differently since the EU Green Deal does not exclude the use of nuclear power to
381
achieve the set targets. In 2011, Germany revised its Atomic Energy Act ( Atomgesetz )t o
ultimately phase out all nuclear power generation by 2022. In August 2015, France adopted a lawto reduce its share of nuclear energy from 75% to 50% by 2025 ( Loi n° 2015-992 relative à la
transition énergétique pour la croissance verte ) but later amended the schedule to achieve this
target by 2035.
Capacity Mechanisms
Although we observe that conventional energy production is declining due to changes in the
regulatory framework described above, we believe that fossil technologies are still required inthe transitional phase to compensate the high volatility of RES power supply and ensure gridstability. To this end, several EU member states have established capacity market mechanisms(e.g., France, Poland, Italy, (UK) and Germany) that the EU Commission approved under EU State
Aid law (see, e.g., 2017/C068/01).
In Germany, the Energy Industry Act ( Energiewirtschaftsgesetz ,“EnWG ”) provides for an energy-
only electricity market with three capacity reserve mechanisms ( Kapazitätsreserve, Netzreserve
and Sicherheitsbereitschaft ). These mechanisms compensate regionally different load distribution
in the grid to avoid congestion (network reserve ( Netzreserve )), prevent a shortage of electricity
by providing an electricity production reserve (capacity reserve ( Kapazitätsreserve )) and allow for
security readiness of lignite-fired power plants ( Sicherheitsbereitschaft ) up to 2023 followed by a
permanent decommissioning. In addition, network stability can also be ensured by prohibitingthe decommissioning of system relevant power plants. Furthermore, TSOs may keep specificnetwork facilities ( netztechnische Betriebsmittel ), in particular even conventional energy
generation facilities, available in order to restore security of energy supply in the event of localequipment failure.
France implemented a national market-wide capacity mechanism for providers offering capacity
when there is a risk of a network bottleneck ( Loi n°2010-1488 sur la nouvelle organisation du
marché de l’electricité dite ). In return, the providers receive certificates that suppliers need to
purchase in order to cover the peak demand of their customers. In Poland, where coal-firedpower plants can participate in capacity auctions, successful bidders receive a steady paymentduring the duration of the capacity agreement. Italy, on the other hand, already restricted theparticipation of power plants that do not comply with the CO
2emission limits set under the
changed requirements for capacity mechanisms under EMR II.
Under the UK Energy Act 2013 and implementing regulations, capacity reserves in the UK are
established by TSOs who organize centrally-managed technology-neutral auctions to procure thelevel of capacity required to ensure electricity supply at times of stress events on the electricitysystem. In previous auctions, bids of operators of gas and coal-fired power plants were alsoaccepted.
13.4.1.2 Renewable Energy Expansion and Financial Funding
As major consequences of the promotion of climate neutrality and decarbonization, we observe
frequent changes and considerable effort in renewable energy expansion regulations andpolicies that affect our business. EU member states have to provide National Energy and ClimatePlans (“ NECP ”) to the EU Commission which provide an overview of their contribution to
reaching overall EU climate and RES plans. However, the countries still decide themselves on theirnational energy mixes. We are therefore required to simultaneously project the demand for ourproducts on independently developing rather than on national markets. The nationally preferredRES technologies may vary, not only for geographical reasons such as RES resources but also fordiversification purposes.
General RES Expansion Targets
European states have enacted partially ambitious national RES expansion targets in the past. The
German Renewable Energy Act 2017 ( Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz 2017 ,“EEG 2017 ”) aims for at
least 40% renewable electricity generation by 2025, 55% by 2035 and at least 80% by 2050.
382
The 2035 aim was increased to 65% by an amendment of the EEG 2017 passed alongside the
KVBG. The current Spanish Draft Bill on Climate Change and Energy Transition ( La Ley de Cambio
Climático y Transición Energética ) aims at a share of 74% RES in electricity generation by 2030.
The Danish NECP of December 2019 aims at 55% RES in energy consumption and 100%renewable electricity by 2030. Finland’s NECP of December 20, 2019, sets a target of 51% of finalenergy consumption by 2030 and Sweden’s NECP of January 16, 2020, aims at 50% of finalenergy consumption already for 2020. Transitioning the electricity generation sector remains atthe core of all approaches and even strategies for continued use of centralized power generationblend with the promotion of RES. Increased RES generation affects our traditional fossil-basedbusiness but may also promote our offshore portfolio ranging from across the entire value chain,including HVDC offshore grid connections, SGRE’s offshore wind turbines and offshore windpower plant substations as well as the respective service.
Following Brexit, the UK did not file a final NECP with the EU Commission. Under the latest UK
draft NECP of January 2019, the Scottish Climate Change Plan of February 2018 and ScottishEnergy Strategy of December 2017 set a target of 50% of all of Scotland’s heat, transport andelectricity consumption to be supplied from RES by 2030. The Welsh Government set targets forgenerating 70% of its electricity consumption from renewable energy by 2030.
Wind Expansion Targets
In Germany, pursuant to the EEG 2017, installation of new onshore wind capacity is to expand by
2,900 MW annually as of 2020, whereas solar capacity shall expand annually by 2,500 MW. Inpart, joint auctions with solar PV are held to assign and determine the financial funding. Thetender volumes increase by the volumes that were not assigned in the previous year. For 2020seven wind onshore auctions with a total volume of 4.100 MW are planned. Under the EEG 2017,offshore wind expansion target is set to 6,500 MW by 2020. A total of 15,000 MW shall beinstalled until 2030. On May 12, 2020, however, the Federal Government, coastal federal statesand TSOs responsible for offshore wind power plant connections reached a political agreementto increase the 2030 target to 20,000 MW. This aim shall be implemented in the course of therevision of the Offshore Wind Act ( Windenergie-auf-See-Gesetz) , which is still ongoing as of the
date of this Prospectus.
The recently updated French Energy and Climate Act sets a target of 3.5 GW of offshore wind
capacity in 2024 and starting from 2024, implements auction procedures of 1 GW per yearoffshore capacity and 1.8 GW onshore capacity (repowering not included). Auctions for onshorewind start in the second half of 2020 until 2024 with 2 auctions per year of 925 MW per auction.In April 2020, the latest draft of France’s multi-year energy plan ( Programmations pluriannuelles
de l’énergie was approved with an onshore wind target of 24.1 GW by 2023 and between 33.2
and 34.7 GW by 2028 as well as an offshore wind target of 2.4 GW by 2023 and between 5.2 and6.2 by 2028.
Spain, pursuant to its NECP of January 20, 2020, targets 120 GW of total RES capacity by 2030,
aiming for a 90% increase in installed wind capacity (onshore and offshore) to 50 GW by 2030.Under Denmark’s latest NECP of December 2019, no individual targets for specific technologieshave yet been set but the plan estimates wind (onshore and offshore) generation to reach acombined share of nearly 20% in the overall energy consumption. Sweden’s NECP expects windpower to increase by 5 GW between 2017 and 2030 and Finland’s NECP projects 5.5 GW ofinstalled wind power capacity by 2030.
Regarding the UK, the Offshore Wind Sector Deal of March 2019 sees offshore wind contributing
up to 30 GW of generating capacity by 2030, subject to further cost decreases. In her speech onthe UK Government’s program of December 19, 2019, the Queen outlined that the UKgovernment intends to increase the target for installed offshore wind energy to 40 GW by 2030.
Challenges for Wind Expansion
Despite the expansion targets, the actual increase of onshore and offshore wind remains
challenging. Main hurdles mostly for onshore wind expansion in every jurisdiction include
383
turbines’ effects on people (noise in particular), wildlife (flight of birds) and natural scenery
(aesthetic pollution), permit requirements and procedures, energetic and, thus, economicallyviable location selection, transmission of produced electricity as well as legal action against windenergy projects. Acceptance is a challenge particularly for onshore wind in Germany and projectsare often delayed because of environmental court claims. In addition, an amendment of theGerman Building Code ( Baugesetzbuch ) of August 8, 2020, enables the German Federal States to
apply a distance rule in residential areas of up to 1,000 meters without prejudice to existing rules.Other jurisdictions have already enacted even lower distance rules, such as in France where 500meters apply under the Energy Law Code ( Code de l’énergie ).
On October 7, 2019, the Federal Ministry for the Economy and Energy ( Bundesministerium für
Wirtschaft und Energie ) published a list of action points to be implemented in 2020 aiming to
accelerate approval procedures for onshore wind power plants, inter alia , by centralizing
approval authorities, amending species protection legislation and limiting the effects of legalprocedures against approval decisions. On August 12, 2020, the Federal Government adopted abill on an Investment Acceleration Act, which shall inter alia shorten administrative proceedings
for large onshore wind turbines and exclude suspensory effects of law suits against such projects.Comparable approval effects could be observed in France after the highest French AdministrativeCourt, the Conseil d’Etat , in December 2017 had annulled a decree designating the prefect of a
region as the authority for issuing the required environmental permits, causing legal uncertaintyfor projects that were approved under this decree.
Another challenge for onshore and offshore wind expansion concerns the congestion of the grid.
In the past, Germany had created massive investment incentives for offshore wind generation. Asof 2009, the TSOs had to connect offshore wind power plants to the transmission grid free ofcharge under the EnWG, unlike onshore grid-connections and unlike in many other jurisdictions,such as the UK. Since 2012, the EnWG also enables offshore wind power plant operators to claimcompensation in the amount of 90% of their hypothetical remuneration from the TSOs in case ofdelays, malfunctions or maintenance works. The TSO may be able to revert to its generalcontractor under the respective contract. In any case, these incentives have resulted in acongestion of the grid. The commissioning of further connection and feed-in capacity would,thus, either increase feed-in management by the respective TSOs or require the expansion oftransmission capacities. Under the current German framework of the EnWG and the EEG 2017,bids for financial funding of onshore wind projects may be rejected, even during tenderproceedings, if they relate to grid-expansion areas. Grid congestion regulation may, thus, impactour on and offshore wind business, including our HVDC business, where sales opportunities areclosely linked to the offshore wind expansion targets.
To solve grid congestion, in particular low-loss HVDC links are to be established to transport
electricity to southern consumption centers of Germany, thereby reducing regional grid load inthe northern areas of generation. The German Grid Expansion Acceleration Act(Netzausbaubeschleunigungsgesetz ,“NABEG ”) contains a special procedure to accelerate
approval proceedings for infrastructure projects. It applies to urgently required extra-high-voltage lines crossing inner-German or international borders and connections between offshorewind power plant substations and the onshore grid.
RES Promotion Schemes
In addition to state-set expansion targets, the demand for our products is also driven by different
financial promotion schemes leveraging our clients’ investments. These promotion schemes havebeen subject to amendments and policy changes in the past that not only affect the profitabilityof our clients’ investments, but also the demand for our onshore and offshore wind products. Asa general trend we have observed a decline in the amount of financial promotion in manyjurisdictions in recent years, sometimes gradual and sometimes more drastically. In addition, wenoticed a shift from fixed feed-in tariffs to market-based tendering procedures. Under manyprior frameworks, fixed feed-in tariffs were designed to guarantee investors an initial and fixedphase of constant return, whereas market-based tender proceedings aim at competition andcost-effectiveness in RES expansion.
384
For example in Germany, different statutory RES support mechanisms have been in place since
1991. Since April 1, 2000, the applicable regulations are set out in the EEG, which underwentseveral major amendments in 2004, 2009, 2012, 2014 and 2017. Generally, financial funding hasbeen reduced over time, depending on the point in time the installation first commencedoperation. In part, financial funding is also subject to options, which provide additionalincentives, such as increased initial tariffs for offshore wind power plants ( Stauchungsmodell )
that commenced operation prior to January 1, 2020. Despite repeated changes to the fundingschemes, the financial funding for a particular project has generally been fixed for a period of 20years following its start of operations. However, new investments are generally only eligible forfinancial funding if awarded in a market-based tender procedure, as ultimately established underthe EEG 2017 and the Offshore Wind Act ( Windenergie-auf-See-Gesetz) . Comparably, the
Netherlands, France in 2017 and Spain in 2016 implemented auction-based remunerationschemes. Also Poland changed its system in 2016. The UK initiated its transition to auction-basedsupport schemes in 2014. However, differences exist with regard to the auction design, i.e.,
concerning the existence and amount of auctions, the volumes auctioned (installed capacity orenergy), the technologies auctioned ( e.g., jointly or separately), whether schemes relate to the
purchase of power or are paid as additional premium to market sales and, especially, regardingthe duration and re-assessment of schemes.
Under RED II member states shall generally prefer market-based schemes, i.e., tender
proceedings, in order to determine the amount of financial funding. In accordance with the EMRII, financial funding shall only be paid in addition to earnings resulting from direct marketing ofthe energy produced on the electricity markets.
In addition, promotion schemes are regularly subject to EU State Aid law in connection with the
EU Commission’s “Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014-2020”,which will be prolonged until 2022 according to a draft communication of the EU Commission.
13.4.1.3 Grid Expansion and Investment Regulation
The expansion of renewable electricity sources coincides with a need for grid expansion in the
transmission and distribution systems. We observe a general transition of the electricity supplysystems which were originally designed for the feed-in of centralized power generation. As theshare of volatile renewable electricity generation grows, grid requirements change and moredecentralized as well as interconnection and flexible solutions are required.
Expansion Obligations of TSOs
Pursuant to the EMR II and national legislation, all European TSOs are generally obliged to
maintain, expand and optimize the grid to meet the demand to the extent economicallyreasonable. Therefore, TSOs are obliged to develop and execute national and EU-wide networkdevelopment plans.
In addition, several national laws apply in member states that accelerate grid expansion to
reduce grid congestion. In the past such bottlenecks were, in particular, caused by the delay ofinfrastructure expansion projects. To this end, legislation like the German EnWG and the EnergyLine Extension Act ( Energieleitungsausbaugesetz ,“EnLAG ”) expedite approval requirements and
procedures for projects that serve the public interest. Also the NABEG aims at acceleratingimportant extra-high-voltage line grid extensions, but is subject to a rather complex proceeding.In any case, the applicable approval requirements such as the thresholds for electromagneticfields under the Electromagnetic Fields Ordinance ( Verordnung über elektromagnetische Felder,
26. BImSchV ) have to be complied with and affected individuals and environmental associations
may be entitled to file lawsuits against the approvals obtained by a TSO.
Refinancing of Grid-related Investments
Grid tariffs are the main source of income for TSOs and, inter alia , refinance grid-related
investments. Therefore, the regulation of TSOs’ profits also impacts the sales of our transmissionportfolio. There is, however, no full harmonization of grid tariff regulation at EU level. EMR II
385
requires that tariffs are cost-reflective, transparent, take into account the need for network
security and flexibility as well as reflect actual costs incurred insofar as they correspond to thoseof an efficient and structurally comparable network operator, be applied in a non-discriminatorymanner and provide for incentives to increase efficiency. The implementation of these guidelinesdiffers in part in EU member states. In the past, many member states took a cost-basedregulation approach in form of a guaranteed rate-of-return or cost-plus regulation adding aprofit margin to the costs of a grid operator. These models have more and more been replacedby incentive-based regulations which provide financial rewards or penalties with a view to anefficient cost base. Incentive-based regulation usually takes the form of yearly revenue caps orprice caps in connection with a guaranteed rate of return to ensure sufficient investment into thegrid. Most member states, but not Germany and Spain, use a WACC factor (Weighted AverageCost of Capital) to calculate the rate of return. In addition, efficiency requirements force gridoperators to reduce costs and work more efficiently regarding their OPEX and/or CAPEX.
In Germany, the EnWG, the Ordinance on Electricity Grid Tariffs ( Stromnetzentgeltverordnung ,
“StromNEV ”) and the Ordinance on Incentive Regulation ( Anreizregulierungsverordnung ,
“ARegV ”) implement the requirements of EU law. The BNetzA defines a revenue cap for each
calendar year of a regulatory period. For electricity TSOs, the current (third) regulatory periodbegan on January 1, 2019 and will end on December 31, 2023. The respective revenue caps arebased on the TSOs’ cost base level ( Kostenausgangsniveau ) which is determined according to a
cost analysis two years prior to the beginning of the regulatory period. The calculated grid costsalso serve as input parameter for an efficiency benchmarking prior to the regulatory period inwhich the individual efficiency factors and targets (Xind) are determined through the applicationof complex benchmarking methodologies. However, an efficiency benchmark is generally notapplied to permanently non-influenceable costs ( dauerhaft nicht beeinflussbare Kosten ). Under
the ARegV, grid expansion measures fall within the scope of permanently non-influenceablecosts if they increase interconnector capacity and/or compromise pilot usage of HVDC technologyto expand grid capacity or to connect (even inner-German) grids. Special rules also apply for thereplacement of infrastructure. Whereas the ARegV generally sets out a project-specific deductionfor the respective costs of a measure, leading to a decrease of recognized costs and thus toreduced profit generated by replacements, such deduction does not apply to investments inHVDC systems intended to expand system capacity or to establish new cross-border connections.Adjustments are performed as of January 1 of each year. Accordingly, a TSO is generally entitledto adjust its grid tariffs in accordance with its adjusted revenue.
A further key driver for the determination of the revenue caps are the BNetzA’s determinations
of interest rates providing for the imputed return on equity within the cost base level. In thecurrent third regulatory period, the BNetzA has decreased these interest rates from 7.14% in thesecond regulatory period (2014-2018) to 5.12% (assets commissioned prior to January 1, 2006,“old assets”) and from 9.05% to 6.91% (assets commissioned as of January 1, 2006, “newassets”). The respective interest rates are applied to non-influenceable costs regardless of theTSO’s individual efficiency. Another important component of the revenue cap determination isthe sectoral productivity factor (Xgen), which reflects the deviation of the electricity grid specificfrom the general economic productivity, and, as of the third regulatory period, is determined bythe BNetzA at 0.9% for electricity grid operators, compared to 1.5% in the second regulatoryperiod pursuant to the ARegV. However, the determination has been appealed and proceedingsare pending as of the date of this Prospectus.
Under the Network Charge Modernization Act ( Netzentgeltmodernisierungsgesetz ) of July 22,
2017, TSOs are no longer entitled to recover investments for offshore grid connections vianetwork tariffs but rather via a separate offshore surcharge. Under the Ordinance on theCalculation of the Offshore Surcharge and Regarding Adjustments in Regulation Law(Verordnung zur Berechnung der Offshore-Netzumlage und zu Anpassungen im
Regulierungsrecht ) of March 21, 2019, the provisions of the StromNEV apply accordingly to the
offshore surcharge. Hence, equity interest calculation of future offshore grid connections remains
386
unchanged. Like under the prior framework, the respective costs are excluded from the efficiency
benchmark. Costs for establishing offshore grid connections may be settled annually via theoffshore surcharge.
13.4.2 Canada
Like the EU, Canada is a party to the Paris Agreement and committed to decreasing national
emissions by 30% in 2030 compared to the base year 2005. The Pan-Canadian Framework onClean Growth and Climate Change (“ PCF”) implements this policy for all sectors of the economy.
The PCF is supplemented by further policies and measures of Canadian provinces and territoriesand supported by federal investments such as, for instance, a low carbon economy fund.
13.4.2.1 Expansion of Non-emitting Electricity Sources
Although the Canadian energy mix varies among the provinces, Canada’s emissions from
electricity generation are already generally considered to be low, with more than 80% ofelectricity being generated by non-emitting sources, mainly hydroelectricity according to the PCF.Under the Green Energy Act of 2009, Ontario launched a feed-in tariff program which washowever terminated by ministerial order of July 13, 2018 due to increasing electricity prices. Inaddition, the Federal Department of Natural Resources Canada generally proposes four pathwaysfor Canada’s energy transition, namely wasting less energy, switching to clean power, using morerenewable fuels and producing cleaner oil and gas. According to this, all provinces mustrecognize renewable energy expansion as a requirement and embark on various programs toincrease its proportion.
13.4.2.2 Carbon Pricing and Coal Phase-out Standards
Another key component to achieve decarbonization is the Federal GHG Pollution Pricing Act
(“GHGPPA ”) of 2018, which implements carbon pricing as of 2019, starting with CAD 20 per
emitted ton of CO
2. The carbon price shall rise to CAD 50 per ton of CO2by 2022, with an annual
increase of CAD 10 and applies to 21 types of fuel and combustible waste. Already prior to theGHGPPA, the provinces had partially established regulatory frameworks to address and enforcedecarbonization. For example, British Columbia has had a carbon-tax in place since 2008 whereasQuebec participates in a cap-and-trade program with U.S. State of California. Against thisbackground, the federal GHGPPA is designed to serve as a backstop where provinces fail to enactadequate measures, including cap-and-trade systems, based on mandatory minimum pricing andemission reduction targets. In this case, the federal government is entitled to impose the GHGPPAcarbon pricing system. As a result, the GHGPPA is in effect in various provinces. However, theGHGPPA is fraught with legal uncertainty because Canadian provincial courts have ruleddifferently on the competence to impose carbon pricing provisions in the provinces. Ultimately,the Supreme Court of Canada will have to decide the matter.
On November 29, 2018, the Canadian department of environment issued a new emission
performance standard regulation for conventional coal-fired power plants. Operators are onlyallowed to continue operation if they comply with substantially increased emission performancestandards for coal-fired electricity generating units by 2030, such as by utilizing carbon capturetechnologies. Otherwise they have to cease operation at the end of the fiftieth year followingtheir respective commissioning date but no later than December 31, 2029. Electricity generatingunits which commenced their operation prior to 1974 had to comply with the standards oralready cease operation by December 31, 2019.
13.4.2.3 Consequences of rising electricity prices for the financial promotion of renewables
In Canada several provinces have addressed price increases in electricity in their policies and as a
consequence have even terminated ongoing projects. For instance, Ontario enacted the GreenEnergy Repeal Act to stop approvals for “wasteful energy projects” where the need for electricitywas not clearly demonstrated. On June 10, 2019, the Alberta government suspended Alberta’s2016 RES program (“ REP”) and required that at least 30% of energy must be produced by RES.
387
The REP had been enabled for a total of three investment rounds and that existing projects be
continued until at least 2021, however now no additional tendering proceedings will be carriedout. The Government of Ontario declared a moratorium on offshore wind power plants in 2011which precludes development in the Great Lakes.
13.4.2.4 Establishment of the Canadian Energy Regulator and revised impact assessment
The Canadian federal and provincial governments share regulatory jurisdiction over the oil, gas
and electricity sectors, resulting in a number of legal and regulatory frameworks for theexploration of Canadian oil and gas reserves and in the electricity sector overall. As aconsequence neither a single energy policy nor a single regulatory body exists. However, onJune 21, 2019, the Canadian parliament passed Bill C-69, which included the Canadian EnergyRegulator (“ CER”) Act (“ CER Act ”) to replace the National Energy Board Act, and established the
CER as a federal regulatory committee with federal authority on August 28, 2019. Under the CERAct, CER is competent for oil and gas pipelines, including traffic and tariffs, international powerlines and certain interprovincial power lines, renewable energy projects and offshore powerlines, access to lands and the exportation of oil, gas and electricity as well as the interprovincialoil and gas trade.
Bill C-69 also includes the Impact Assessment Act (“ IA Act ”) under which the federal Impact
Assessment Agency (“ IAA”) is established. The federal impact assessment process established
under the IA Act serves as a planning tool which takes into account a broad range of potentialenvironmental, health, social and economic effects of designated projects identified byregulation or designated by the Minister of Environment and Climate Change. Decisions arebased on whether the potential adverse effects in areas of federal jurisdiction are in the publicinterest and in contrast to the previous environmental assessment process, where decisions werebased on whether a project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. Theimpact assessment covers a comprehensive catalogue of factors to be decided on and alsoprovides for public participation.
13.4.2.5 Infrastructure expansion
The CER must approve construction of transmission lines across provincial boundaries and, as per
the IA Act, infrastructure projects within provinces as well. Investments by the TSOs are regulatedby both the provincial regulator of each province and by the CER as far as investments betweenprovinces or import and export of electricity to neighboring jurisdictions are concerned. Canadahas a long-term infrastructure plan in place to cover green infrastructure. The CanadianInfrastructure Bank attracts and co-invests with private and institutional investors, such as TSOs,in new, revenue-generating infrastructure projects that are in the public interest prioritizing,inter alia , green infrastructure projects.
13.4.3 USA
Energy and climate policies in the U.S. differ significantly from those in effect in the European
Union and Canada and remain hard to predict over mid and long term. In the absence ofmandatory GHG emission reduction targets at the federal level, individual states have takendifferent approaches to reduce sector-specific GHG emissions. For example, although the U.S.federal administration in 2019 terminated the Paris Agreement with effect as of November 4,2020, two thirds of the U.S. states have enacted certain renewable portfolio standards (“ RPS”) to
promote the use of clean electricity sources and twelve states operate ETSs.
13.4.3.1 The U.S. Energy Dominance Policy
The U.S. energy dominance policy (“ EDP”) under the Trump administration repealed and
replaced several regulations promulgated under the prior Obama administration to reduce GHGemissions consistent with goals set by the USA under the Paris Agreement. Unlike existingEuropean policies, the EDP intends to drive economic growth by increasing oil and gas extractionand accelerating infrastructure development. Federal legislative efforts include additional drilling
388
opportunities and prioritized proceedings for pipeline projects and LNG terminals. Most notably,
Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was opened up for oil and gas drilling activities at theend of 2017. However, in September 2019, Congress passed the Arctic Cultural and Coastal PlainProtection Act restoring protection of the arctic refuge. As of the date of this Prospectus, the billis pending approval in the Senate.
Following an executive presidential order, the EPA on June 19, 2019, also repealed the carbon
pollution emission guidelines for existing sources, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan(“CPP”). The CPP was the first- U.S. national standard to address carbon pollution from power
plants, originally introduced by the EPA under the CAA in 2015. By setting strict CO
2emission
limits, in particular for coal-fired power plants, the CPP aimed to cut CO2emissions from the
power sector by 32% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The Affordable Clean Energy Rule (“ ACE
Rule”) and related implementing regulations then replaced the CPP with the aim to reduce CO2
emissions without shutdowns of coal-fired power plants by promoting technology and
equipment upgrades. It establishes heat rate improvements, i.e., efficiency improvements, as the
best system of emission reduction for CO2, employing a broad range of technologies and
techniques. In determining their application, states may take into account the remaining usefullife of the source and other source-specific factors in establishing standards of performance,which might allow for establishing less stringent standards of performance, in particular, forplants with a near-term decommissioning date. However, the ACE Rule does not apply togas-fired power plants.
On January 25, 2018, the EPA further issued a guidance memorandum on the reclassification of
sources for HAP as area source under the CAA at any time after taking steps to limit emissionsdespite EPA’s prior “once in always in policy”. Subsequently, in 2019, EPA issued a proposed ruleon the reclassification of major sources as area sources implementing its reclassification policy.The applicable eligibility threshold for a reclassification is 10 tons per year in case of a single HAPor 25 tons of a combination of different HAP.
On December 6, 2018, the EPA issued an updated cross-state air pollution rule (close-out-rule),
which addresses interstate pollution obligations under the so-called “good neighbor” regime ofthe CAA and exempts 20 states from submitting state implementation plans and establishingcontrol requirements to address transported ozone pollution to ultimately allow other states tomeet their NAAQS. On September 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, vacatedthe close-out-rule, holding that it violated CAA requirements.
Under the Obama administration, on June 3, 2016 the EPA enacted various emission standards
for the oil and gas sector which are applicable to new, reconstructed and modified sources andintend to curb emissions of methane, smog forming volatile organic compounds and toxic airpollutants. The performance standards include a number of obligations to reduce methaneemissions from existing oil and gas sources and, in particular, New Source Performance Standards(“NSPS ”). Under the current policy, the EPA has taken various approaches to postpone the
implementation of NSPS standards. Most recently on August 29, 2019, the EPA issued a proposalto remove methane control provisions from the NSPS for oil and natural gas.
Industry-related approaches to lower emission standards are accompanied by less stringent
demand-side requirements regarding the consumption of oil and gas. For instance, the NationalHighway Traffic Safety Administration (“ NHTSA ”) and EPA jointly issued a rule to finalize “critical
parts” of the Safer, Affordable, Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule. Under this rule, the NHTSAclaims statutory authority to set nationally applicable fuel economy standards. The rollout onMarch 31, 2020 set standards that increase 1.5% in stringency each year from model years 2021through 2026. Compared to maintaining the post-2020 standards set forth in 2012, the U.S. fuelconsumption would thereby increase by about half a million barrels per day which, according toEPA figures, would impact the global climate by 3/1000th of one degree Celsius by 2100.
389
13.4.3.2 CO2reduction and Clean Energy Standards
Despite the EDP, there are also approaches to foster and enforce CO2emission reductions in the
USA. On the federal level, the House of Representatives tried to compel the U.S. President to actin accordance with the Paris Agreement with its Climate Action Now Act in May 2019. OnJanuary 28, 2020, the Committee on Energy and Commerce presented a Draft for a ClimateLeadership and Environmental Action for our Nation’s (CLEAN) Future Act (“ CLEAN Future Act ”)
aiming at a net-zero emission strategy by 2050 and providing for a clean electricity standard(“CES”) requiring all retail electricity suppliers to provide an increasing supply of clean electricity
to consumers starting in 2022, increasing to 100% clean energy by 2050. On July 1, 2020,Democrats in the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis released a Climate Crisis ActionPlan that aims to achieve “net-negative” emissions by 2100 and proposes comprehensive reformsto federal environmental and energy laws.
In addition, on February 27, 2020 Senate representatives of both parties presented a Draft
American Energy Innovation Act (“ AEIA Draft ”) compiling more than 50 energy related bills. Its
key provisions relate to energy efficiency, renewable energy and energy storage, carbon capture,advanced nuclear technologies, industrial and vehicle technologies, grid security andmodernization, and workforce development. The US federal government has also incentivizedCO
2emission reductions through federal tax credit programs, such as the Section 45Q tax credit,
which is available to taxpayers who capture carbon oxide from certain sources and thensequester it in secure geological formations. Guidance on the Section 45Q tax credit is stilldeveloping but it is similar in structure to the production tax credit and investment tax creditavailable to renewable energy projects (see “ 13.4.3.3 Financial Promotion of CO2 Emissions
Reductions and Renewable Portfolio Standards ” below).
13.4.3.3 Financial Promotion of CO
2Emissions Reductions and Renewable Portfolio Standards
Currently, renewable energy projects in the USA rely on the federal production tax credit (“ PTC”)
and investment tax credit (“ ITC”). The PTC is a tax credit per kWh for the first 10 years of
electricity generation applicable to wind projects in different ranges depending on the begin ofconstruction and was prolonged in December 2019 until 2020. The ITC offers a tax credit toprojects regarding part of the investment costs at the start of a project. On June 26, 2020,legislation was introduced into the US House of Representatives that would extend the PTC until2025 and the ITC beyond 2027, if adopted.
Separate from federal tax programs and activities aimed at the development of clean energy,
many states have enacted and expanded ambitious RPS and CES frameworks. For example, in2015, Hawaii enacted the first RPS in the USA that mandates its electric utility companies toacquire 100% of net electricity sales from RES by the end of 2045 and Vermont passed a 75% RPStarget by end of 2032, rising to 90% by 2050. California updated its RPS in 2018 to require 100%of the electricity consumed in the state to come from carbon-free sources by 2045. In 2019, NewYork passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, requiring a 100% carbonneutral power system by 2040 and an 85% reduction in GHG by 2050. New Mexico, the District ofColumbia, Maine, Nevada, Puerto Rico, and Washington have also recently adopted 100% cleanenergy targets. Governors in Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Rhode Island, Massachusetts,Minnesota, New Jersey and Wisconsin have also each committed to achieving 100% carbon-freeelectricity, with targets for achieving that goal ranging from 2030 to 2050. In 2018, ten statesincreased their RPS and in 2019, the District of Columbia, New Mexico, Nevada and Marylandincreased their targets as well.
The promotion of carbon-free electricity sources is based on the states’ RPS and on other state
regulatory policies, such as procurement schemes, which require utilities in the electricity sectorto bid for and contract directly with certain state-preferred energy types and sources. In June2019, Maine enacted a law to incentivize 375 MW of new distributed generation. At least fivestates have so far adopted targets specifically for energy storage, including New York, which hasa current target to procure 3 GW of energy storage capacity by 2030. Virginia’s recently passedbill committing the commonwealth to 100% renewable energy by 2040 also includes an energy
390
storage deployment target of 2.7 GW by 2035. The amount of energy storage in the USA is
expected to double again in 2019 and by 2024; deployments are expected to exceed 4.4 GW. Atleast five states have now adopted specific targets for energy storage, with New York’s target of3 GW by 2030 being the most ambitious to date. Other states have included energy storage intheir planning processes and competitive solicitations.
To accommodate the increased implementation of electric storage resources, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (“ FERC ”) issued Order No. 841 in 2018 and directed regional grid
operators to remove barriers to the participation of electric storage resources in the organizedwholesale electricity markets by requiring the RTOs and ISOs to establish market rules thatfacilitate such participation and take into account the physical and operational characteristics ofelectric storage resources.
13.4.3.4 Offshore Wind Expansion Plans
There is also considerable effort in the U.S. to foster the large-scale development and
deployment of offshore wind generation. In particular east coast states enacted ambitiousoffshore wind generation targets and procurement obligations under their RPS and CES schemes.The states of New York ( Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act , enacted on July 18,
2019, “ CLCPA ”), New Jersey ( Offshore Wind Development Act , issued in January 2018 and
Executive Order No. 8 of January 31, 2018, and No. 92 of November 19, 2019) Massachusetts ( An
Act to Promote Energy Diversity , issued on August 8, 2016 and An Act to Advance Clean Energy ,
issued on July 31, 2018), Maryland ( Clean Energy Jobs Act , enacted on May 29, 2019) and
Connecticut ( An Act Concerning the Procurement of Energy Derived from Offshore Wind , issued
on June 7, 2019) enacted ambitious offshore wind targets and procurement obligations by wayof legislative acts, Virginia by way of an executive order ( Executive Order No. 43 of 17 September
2019). The largest commitment to offshore development can be found in the New York CLCPA,pursuant to which the state of New York targets the development of 9 GW in offshore windcapacity by 2035. California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire and North Carolina haveall also expressed interest in the deployment of offshore wind generation, with varying levels ofdevelopment. There is also interest in deploying offshore wind generation in inland waters, asthere are current plans for offshore wind generation development in Lake Erie near Cleveland,Ohio.
13.4.3.5 Infrastructure Expansion and Regulation
Under the Federal Power Act, FERC oversees and regulates the interstate transmission of
electricity. FERC’s Order No. 1000 adopted significant reforms of FERC’s transmission planningand cost-allocation rules. Order No. 1000 sought to address significant recent changes in the bulkpower industry, including an increased emphasis on integrating renewable generation andreducing congestion, by implementing new policies to push transmission providers and plannersto seek more reliable, efficient and cost-efficient solutions. The major reforms of Order No. 1000include (i) requiring each public utility transmission provider to participate in a regionaltransmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan and regional andinterregional cost allocation methods for planned projects; (ii) requiring each public utilitytransmission provider to amend its transmission tariff to describe procedures for consideringtransmission needs driven by public policy requirements established by state or federal laws orregulations, such as state RPS; (iii) removing from FERC-approved tariffs and agreements anyfederal right of first refusal for incumbent utilities to build and own certain new transmissionfacilities; and (iv) improving coordination between neighboring transmission planning regions.
Order No. 1000 also provides that transmission upgrade cost allocations must be roughly
commensurate with the benefits received. FERC required public utility transmission providers tobegin making filings with FERC during 2012 that proposed revisions to their transmissionplanning processes under their respective tariffs to comply with Order No. 1000. Throughout2013, FERC issued orders regarding some of these compliance filings in which it accepted andrejected various proposed revisions, including rejecting a number of proposals to retain certain
391
types of rights of first refusal for incumbent transmission providers to build and own transmission
projects eligible for socialized cost recovery.
The further course for large-scale transmission projects, including HVDC technology and financial
incentive regulation remains hard to predict. The Draft CLEAN Future Act aims to establish acomprehensive national transmission policy designed to facilitate, in particular, a decarbonizedelectricity supply, which, besides cost-effectivity, shall take into account and evaluate benefitsoffered by interregional and regional transmission solutions. Thereby, the draft aims to broadlyrevise the respective FERC regulations and emphasize decarbonization and long-term efficiency.By contrast, the AEIA Draft aims to direct FERC’s attention to energy storage with provisionsfocused on the development of micro-grids.
On April 2, 2020, FERC issued a proposed rulemaking to revise its existing transmission incentives
policy and corresponding regulations for certain types of transmission projects subject tocost-of-service ratemaking. These incentives include, among other things, return on equity addersand possible recovery of costs for transmission projects abandoned for reasons beyond thecontrol of a transmission developer. In its proposed rulemaking FERC recognized that a numberof significant advancements in the development of new transmission facilities had occurred since2006, when FERC formalized its current incentive policies. In particular, among other things, FERCproposes to depart from the risks and challenges approach used to evaluate requests fortransmission incentives and instead focus on granting incentives based on the benefits toconsumers of transmission infrastructure investment, which is an important factor with regard toestablishing inter-regional HVDC transmission projects, such as long distance HVDC transmissionlines to transmit power from regions with significant renewable generation potential to distantpopulation and load centers. Moreover, FERC proposes a separate return on equity incentive fortransmission projects that provide significant and demonstrable reliability benefits by providingquantitative analysis, where possible, as well as qualitative analysis. If adopted, in particulartransmission projects that significantly increase import or export capability between balancingauthorities would be eligible for additional incentives.
Further FERC orders which affect or may affect our HVDC business particularly include the reform
of generator interconnection procedures and agreements issued on February 21, 2019 (OrderNo. 827), the cyber security incident reporting reliability standards of July 19, 2018 (OrderNo. 845-A) and the order on uplift cost allocation and transparency in markets operated by RTOsand ISOs of April 19, 2018 (Order No. 844).
In May 2020, President Trump issued an Executive Order prohibiting certain transactions
regarding bulk-power system electric equipment designed, developed, manufactured or suppliedby persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreignadversary. The prohibition applies only to those transactions that pose: (i) an undue risk ofsabotage to or subversion of the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution,installation, operation or maintenance of the bulk-power system in the U.S.; (ii) an undue risk ofcatastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of U.S. critical infrastructure or the economy ofthe U.S.; or (iii) an unacceptable risk to the national security of the U.S. or the security and safetyof U.S. persons.
13.4.4 China
China’s long-term energy policy is characterized by commitments under the Paris Agreement,
which requires it to reduce carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65% and increase thenon-fossil share of its primary energy consumption to 20% by 2030. These commitments havebeen incorporated into the National Strategy on Energy Production and Consumption Revolution(2016-2030) of April 25, 2017 (“ ERS”).
13.4.4.1 China’s Five-Year Plan
China’s energy development targets are set out in the 13
thFive-Year Plan on Energy
Development (“ Energy 13thFYP”) based on the National 13thFive-Year Plan and released by the
392
National Energy Administration (“ NEA”). It includes an energy consumption cap at five billion
tons of coal equivalents and a 15% target for the share of non-fossil-based energy in China’sprimary energy mix by the end of 2020. The associated 13
thFive-Year Plan for Wind Power and
the 13thFive-Year Plan for Solar Power set respective targets of 210 GW and at least 160 GW of
installed power generation to be reached by the end of 2020. The Energy 13thFYP also sets out
targets to promote and construct demonstration projects to achieve breakthroughs in the field ofadvanced hydrogen production. However, most targets are non-binding and provide directionalmarket development. China’s future energy policy for the period from 2021 to 2025 will be set bythe 14
thFive-Year Plan, which is expected for March 2021.
13.4.4.2 China’s Energy Bill
On April 10, 2020, the NEA released a consultative draft of a new energy law of the People’s
Republic of China, which will merge all existing energy laws. It prioritizes the development andutilization of RES and aims to set further targets for the share of renewable energy generationwithin China’s overall energy mix by establishing a binding renewable energy target mechanismand a guaranteed consumption mechanism for RES. The bill also stresses that China willstrengthen its supervision of pollutants and GHG emissions. Additionally, wholesale energy priceswill be gradually liberalized. However, the bill merely constitutes a framework law that has to beimplemented by various measures at local level. Therefore, as of the date of this Prospectus,specifics on the regulatory objectives are unclear.
13.4.4.3 Conventional Power Generation Regulation
The Energy 13
thFYP sets a 1,100 GW cap for coal-fired power generation by the end of 2020. In
addition, the legal framework for construction and operation of carbon intensive energygeneration facilities, in particular coal-based power plants, is becoming more stringent. OnMarch 17, 2016, the NEA established a “traffic light” system to curtail the construction of newcoal-fired power plants. On the basis of factors such as resource constraints, coal plantprofitability and existing coal-fired power capacity, the NEA assesses whether provinces mustimmediately halt all new coal plant construction projects or may (cautiously) proceed withapprovals and constructions. In 2019, the NEA published the results of an “early warning” reportfor coal power in 2022 that indicated that ten provinces and regions would have an excess ofcoal-fired electricity generation capacity by 2022, which is a sharp reduction from its 21 provincesin the early warning for 2021 issued in 2018. Consequently, eleven areas were permitted to startbuilding coal-fired power plants again.
The Action Plan for the Upgrade of Coal-Fired Power released in September 2014 and subsequent
policies set net efficiency targets for existing coal-fired power plants of 39.6% and for new plantsof 40.9%. Furthermore, China has substantially tightened its air emission rules, especially for coal-fired power plants, in order to eliminate outdated coal-fired energy units.
Wholesale prices for energy are strictly regulated in China based on its Electric Power Law, but
market-based mechanisms have been gradually introduced to liberalize the energy market.Under the previous scheme, the National Development and Reform Commission (“ NDRC ”)
determined the wholesale price for energy generated by coal-fired power plants by a power ongrid tariff and a corresponding coal price pass-through mechanism. On September 26, 2019,China announced it would terminate this scheme for coal-fired power plants by 2020 andimplement a market-based electricity pricing structure. The new mechanism sets a base wholesaleprice and a variable element, allowing an upward price revision of 10% and downward of 15%,depending on negotiations or biddings between power generators, supply companies and endusers.
Regarding gas-fired power generation, the 13th Five-Year Plan for Power Sector Development,
issued by the NEA and the NDRC on December 22, 2016, sets a target of 110 GW to be reached bythe end of 2020.
393
13.4.4.4 Emission Trading System
In December 2017, China launched a national Emission Trading System (“ Chinese ETS ”), to be
implemented by the end of 2020. Currently, the Chinese ETS covers only coal-fired powergeneration facilities but it is intended to be expanded to cover petrochemical, chemical, buildingmaterials, steel, nonferrous metals, paper and domestic aviation. When fully implemented, theChinese ETS will cover eight billion tons of CO
2emissions per annum from around 100,000
industrial plants. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment will allocate allowances, therebytaking into account not only emission targets but also economic growth and structureadjustments. The Chinese ETS will not feature an overall cap on CO
2emissions. Instead, every
covered facility will be allocated a CO2intensity benchmark, stipulating the amount of CO2it may
emit per unit of electricity it generates. Plants that fall below their benchmark will have excessquota to sell, noncompliance will lead to significant sanctions. The Chinese ETS thereforeincentivizes energy efficiency rather than the decrease of the overall fossil-based energygeneration.
13.4.4.5 Nuclear Power Strategy
Besides coal and gas-fired power generation, China continues to rely on nuclear energy. After a
moratorium on new nuclear power plants following the 2011 Fukushima accident, China resumedits nuclear power strategy. The Energy Development Strategy Action Plan, passed by the StateCouncil in 2014, sets a target for installed nuclear power capacity of 58 GW and 30 GW fornuclear power capacity under construction by 2020. However, the expansion depends on furtherdecisions at the political level.
13.4.4.6 Renewable Energy Generation Expansion Targets
The ERS stipulates that China is aiming for non-fossil power generation to account for at least
31% of electricity consumption by the end of 2020 and at least 50% by 2030.
On May 10, 2019 the NEA and the NDRC released a renewable energy obligation policy, the
Notice Establishing a Mandatory Renewable Electricity Consumption Mechanism, imposingprovincial renewable energy consumption quota ranging from 10% in eastern provinces to 88%in southwestern provinces (Renewable Portfolio Standard Targets) to promote renewable energyconsumption. These targets are binding for state owned or provincial grid companies as well aslarge end-users. In January 2017, the NDRC, the NEA and the Chinese Ministry of Finance jointlyissued the Trial Mechanism on Issuing and Trading Renewable Energy Green Certificates whichelectricity consumers can voluntarily purchase to achieve their renewable portfolio standardtargets. Parties that outperformed their quota obtain tradable Renewable Energy Certificateswhich they may sell to parties that failed to meet their quotas.
13.4.4.7 Renewable Energy Generation Support Schemes
The support scheme for renewable energy generation has undergone significant changes in
recent years with a particular trend towards a subsidy-free RES power generation.
Wind and solar-based power generation development in China has mainly been driven by policy
support such as feed-in tariffs, local subsidies, demonstration projects and high targets ofinstalled capacity. According to the feed-in tariff system, the wholesale price for renewableenergy consists of the coal-fired power on grid tariff and an additional remuneration dependenton various factors, in particular wind or solar resources and energy demand. Under the market-based electricity pricing structure introduced in 2020, the wholesale base price set by theauthorities replaces the coal-fired power on grid tariff as point of reference for subsidies.
Regarding subsidies for solar PV, the NEA has handed out annual quota to each province and
only installations covered by the annual quota are eligible to receive subsidies through feed-intariffs on the basis of tender procedures. To curb the increase of solar PV and to adjust to thedecreased manufacturing costs, feed-in tariffs have been lowered in recent years and halved in2020.
394
Wind power projects, onshore and offshore, must compete for construction quotas and feed-in
tariffs through tender procedures as well since the NDRC has released a bidding feed-in tariffscheme for wind power generation in 2019 replacing fixed feed-in tariffs. Under the scoringsystem of the bidding feed-in tariff scheme, the bidding price constitutes only one out of sixrelevant factors in addition to grid connection, preliminary work, project design, technologyexcellence and investor capability. However, new offshore power projects starting constructionafter January 1, 2021 will no longer receive subsidies from the central government, but localgovernments may still subsidize these projects. Onshore wind power projects will becomesubsidy-free by 2021.
Furthermore, on January 7, 2019, NDRC and NEA jointly announced the plan to launch subsidy-
free wind and solar pilots in regions with superior wind or solar resources and powerconsumption capability which are not confined to the annual capacity cap. For those pilotprojects, grid companies should give grid-access priority and ensure full uptake of the electricityoutput. In order to promote pilot projects, further incentives apply, in particular regarding landuse rights.
13.4.4.8 Further Policies to Support Renewable Energy Generation
Despite the paradigm shift regarding the subsidization of RES, China continues to strengthen its
market position in green technologies. In April 2019, the NDRC and the Ministry of Science andTechnology jointly issued the Guidance on Building a Market-oriented Green TechnologyInnovation System (“ Green Technology Guidance ”), containing measures that relevant
government bodies should implement by 2022 to accelerate green innovation in China. TheGreen Technology Guidance, in particular, requires more efforts to enhance financial support andencourage companies to participate in government supported and market oriented projects ingreen technology innovation through financial incentives and improved IP rights.
To further reduce its GHG emissions in the heating sector caused by coal heating systems, China’s
government in 2017 introduced the Clean Winter Heating Plan in Northern China (2017-2021)calling for large scale renewable energy deployment in clean heating. Accordingly, the cleanheating rate should increase from 34% in 2017 to 70% by 2021 in the northern area and to 100%in key cities and districts, in particular through wind power heating as well as biomass and waste-fueled co-generation plants. The NEA urged local authorities to set annual targets for generatingheating using wind power generated energy, to promote the deployment of wind power heatingand to improve market-based trading by the Notice on Improving the Power Trading for WindPower Heating and Expanding Wind Power Heating, introduced in April 2019.
13.4.4.9 Infrastructure Expansion
Due to the increased deployment of RES, China’s energy infrastructure faces new challenges. In
particular, renewable energy generation results in high volatility of feed-in energy, as wind andsolar energy generation is weather-dependent. Hence, the demand for energy storage increasesowing to the rising need for grid resilience and stability. To support further growth in RES andmeet increased demand for energy storage due to the weather dependency of RES, the NDRCreleased the 2019-2020 Action Plan to Guide the Technological and Industrial Development ofthe Energy Storage Sector (NDRC 2019, No. 725). The plan aims to promote and develop energystorage capacities and technology by improving the legal framework for energy storage projectsand encouraging demonstration projects.
Power grid expansion planning is essential to balance energy demand and generation as well as
transmission capacity. Hence, the grid planning process carried out by the NEA considers policyobjectives such as renewable energy deployment targets as well as the growing demand forenergy. The planning results in a final national power plan issued by the NEA after beingapproved by the NDRC. The 2015-2020 Power Grid Construction and Reform Plan released by theNEA in July 2015 provides for a cumulative infrastructure investment of approximately RMB 2trillion by 2020. Additionally, in November 2018, the NDRC and the NEA jointly released theClean Energy Consumption Action Plan according to which China will invest significantly in grid
395
infrastructure in order to reduce curtailment rates and expand energy transmission capacities. At
the same time China plans to expand its high voltage regional AC grid to absorb the output ofthe HVDC lines. As regional grids are AC grids but transmission grids use DC technology, China isin the process of developing a hybrid AC-DC grid system and at the same time plans furtherinvestments in smart grid infrastructure.
13.5 Market Access Regulations
13.5.1 Public Procurement Law
We conduct a large share of our business with governments and government-owned enterprises.
The award of contracts with such entities is commonly subject to public procurement laws whichare found in international, European and national legislation. Public procurement laws generallyrequire public entities, sectoral contracting entities and concession grantors to award contractsand concessions in a transparent and non-discriminatory tender procedure, dependent on certainthresholds. Tender obligations also apply to material amendments to existing contracts. In case ofviolation of public procurement requirements, the underlying contract may become null and voidand competitors may claim damages against the public contracting entity.
On an international level, many of the countries into which we deliver our products are bound by
public procurement provisions of the Government Procurement Agreement ( Übereinkommen
über das öffentliche Beschaffungswesen ,“GPA”). At the European level, Directive (EC) 2014/24
on public procurement applies. Germany has implemented the international and European rulesinto national procurement law, particularly in form of the German Act against Restrictions ofCompetition ( Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen ).
In the U.S., the Federal Acquisition Regulation sets out the policies and procedures for
acquisitions by all federal departments and agencies and implements or addresses nearly everyprocurement-related U.S. statute or executive policy. Public procurement in Canada is regulatedon various governmental levels (federal, provincial, municipal), including the Code of Conduct ofProcurement, the Federal Accountability Act and the Financial Administration Act. In China, theGovernment Procurement Law and the Law on Tenders and Bids set the legal framework forpublic procurement. The Brazilian Constitution requires a public procurement procedure for allpurchases and sales made and all services and works commissioned by public administration.Brazilian Federal Law 8,666/1993 provides the general framework for these procedures. The USA,Canada, China and Brazil have each implemented regulations on domestic preference of nationalproducts and services that have to be observed during the evaluation process. These domesticpreferences may be mitigated by multilateral and bilateral trade agreements like the GPA, whichhas been signed by the U.S. and Canada, but not yet Brazil and China.
13.5.2 Export Control and Sanctions Regulations
13.5.2.1 Internal Market and CustomsWithin the European Union’s internal market, the principle of free movement of goods generally
applies. When importing from and exporting goods to non-EU countries, we must comply withnational and European as well as international export control laws and customs regulations.
At the EU level, the regulatory framework concerning customs is the Union Customs Code
(Regulation (EU) 952/2013), with powers of customs authorities being further set out in nationallaws of the member states. In Germany, details are regulated in the German CustomsAdministration Act ( Zollverwaltungsgesetz ), according to which customs controls may consist of,
among other things: (i) examining goods, (ii) verifying the accuracy and completeness ofinformation given in a declaration or notification, (iii) verifying the existence, authenticity,accuracy and validity of documents, (iv) inspecting means of transport, luggage and other goodscarried by or on persons, and (v) carrying out official enquiries and other similar acts.
396
13.5.2.2 Foreign Trade and Dual Use Goods
As we sell our products and provide our services to customers worldwide, we are subject to the
restrictions of several export control regulations. In addition, we procure goods and services fromsuppliers worldwide which might also be subject to export restrictions. In Germany, exportingcompanies have to comply with European and German export control regulations, applicabledepending on (i) the kind of product and the purpose for which the product has been developed,(ii) the country of destination and (iii) the intended use of the exported goods. Exports aresupervised by the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control ( Bundesamt für
Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle ,“BAFA ”). Applicable legislation includes the German Foreign
Trade and Payments Act ( Außenwirtschaftsgesetz ), the German Foreign Trade and Payments
Ordinance ( Außenwirtschaftsverordnung ), and Regulation (EC) 428/2009 setting up a community
regime for the control of exports, brokering and transit of dual-use items (“ Dual Use
Regulation ”).
In Germany, depending on the kind of goods and services, the purpose for which the goods have
been designed, the country of destination and the intended use, exports may be subject tolicense requirements or control measures by the BAFA. Authorizations are, inter alia , mandatory
for the export of goods and services that are listed in the Dual Use Regulation, but may also berequired for non-listed goods or services if these goods or services are intended to be used forcertain military or nuclear purposes. The latter may, in particular, be the case for control andinstrumentation equipment that we produce for power plants.
13.5.2.3 Embargoes and Trade Sanctions
When selling and/or delivering our products to customers around the globe we must observe
economic sanctions and embargoes. Such measures can be based on national legislation (like inGermany, the UK or the USA), but also on acts of supranational organizations like the EuropeanUnion and the United Nations. They can take the form of comprehensive embargoes (totalembargoes), partial embargoes, such as arms, sectoral or financial embargoes and may bedirected at countries, organizations, groups, non-state entities and individuals. Person-relatedsanctions usually prohibit placing assets of any kind at the disposal of sanctioned parties orproviding them with any economic resources.
In the USA, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, among others, regulates the import
and export of goods from the USA. Imports are governed by a number of laws, including theTariff Act of 1930. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and otherfederal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seekto impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, exportcontrols laws, anti-money laundering laws and other federal statutes and regulations, includingthose established by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“ OFAC ”).
Various government agencies may seek to impose modifications to business practices, includingcessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities aswell as modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and maysubject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions.
Moreover, in November 2018, the U.S. announced it would withdraw from the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action which had previously eased U.S. sanctions on Iran under theauthority of, among others, the Iran Sanctions Act, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions,Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010, the National Defense Authorization Act for FiscalYear 2012, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, the Iran Freedom andCounter-Proliferation Act of 2012, and various executive orders. In broad terms, the U.S. havere-imposed U.S. extraterritorial sanctions measures against Iran in connection with activityrelated to Iran’s energy, petrochemical, automotive, shipping, shipbuilding, port operating andfinancial sectors. Persons engaged in such activities involving Iran will face exposure to secondarysanctions or enforcement actions under U.S. law.
U.S. trade sanctions have been particularly relevant regarding our business with Cuba, Iran and
Venezuela, because we have to ensure that no U.S. goods, persons or companies are involved in
397
such transactions, not even indirectly. The U.S. sanctions apply primarily to U.S. persons, which,
inter alia , include all companies and other legal entities organized under U.S. law as well as
permanent residents. In the case of the Cuba and Iran sanctions programs, the U.S. sanctions alsoapply to non-U.S.-entities owned or controlled by U.S. persons. The United States have alsoimposed primary sanctions on certain Russian individuals, companies and sectors of the Russianeconomy.
Besides country or territory-based and sectoral sanctions (which, e.g., target certain sectors of the
Russian economy), the U.S. government also imposes list-based sanctions against certain entitiesand individuals, including through the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Personsadministered by OFAC. The obligation to screen U.S. sanctions lists may also follow fromcontracts with suppliers, credit facilities or loan agreements that require compliance with U.S.sanctions or screening against U.S. sanctions lists.
In addition, U.S. sanctions may also have an extraterritorial effect and apply even to non-“U.S.
persons” as defined above (so-called “secondary sanctions”), if such entity or individualundertakes certain transactions or activities which are subject to a set of sanctions to be imposedby U.S. administration. For example, as a result of the Countering America’s Adversaries ThroughSanctions Act of 2017, non-U.S. persons must comply with certain secondary sanctions againstRussia, even if such activities have no connection to the U.S. Among other things, non-U.S.persons may face penalties for knowingly facilitating significant transactions or significantfinancial transactions for or on behalf of a party subject to the United States’ sanctions againstRussia. Further, non-U.S. persons and entities that cause a U.S. person to violate U.S. sanctionsmay also violate the U.S. sanctions for facilitation reasons and risk civil and criminal penaltiesunder applicable U.S. law. Accordingly, transacting business with customers in particularcountries such as Cuba may be allowed under EU law but still violate U.S. sanctions. In case ofsuch conflicts between EU law and U.S. sanctions, the Blocking Statute (EC) 2271/96 (as amended)prohibits EU companies from complying with certain listed U.S. sanctions and shields theseentities from the effects of U.S. sanctions in the EU. Such anti-boycott rules apply, for example, tothe 2018 U.S. sanctions targeting Iran. EU companies are, nonetheless, free to conduct theirbusiness as they see fit, i.e., not trade with countries sanctioned by the U.S.
EU trade sanctions have a broad scope, applying (i) within the territory of the member states,
(ii) to any person inside or outside the territory of the European Union who is a national of amember state, (iii) to any legal person, entity or body which is incorporated or constituted underthe law of a member state whether acting inside or outside the European Union, and (iv) to anylegal person, entity, or body in respect of any business done in whole or in part within theEuropean Union.
In recent years, our business has been particularly affected by EU sanctions against Russia which
apply alongside and in addition to U.S. sanctions. The embargoes limit the freedom of foreigntrade with the embargoed countries. They also prohibit that funds, other financial assets andeconomic resources be made available directly or indirectly to or for the benefit of a natural orlegal person, group or entity included in the list of restricted parties of that embargoed country,or by prohibiting goods, services, financial or other related services from being rendered for thebenefit of restricted parties of that embargoed country. These examples reflect the current legalsituation only, which is, however, subject to frequent changes as sanctions lists are updated on aregular basis.
13.5.3 Financing of Projects, Export Support and State Aid
13.5.3.1 Financing and Export SupportAs exporter of goods produced in numerous global manufacturing plants, we make use of
different national Export Credit Agencies (“ ECAs ”) which support and promote national exports
by providing risk coverage for lenders and exporters. For ECAs from OECD-member countries, theArrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits (“ OECD Consensus ”) applies and defines the
framework for ECAs projects, including rules for financial support regarding things like coal-
398
fired or nuclear power plants, renewable energy, climate change mitigation and adaptation and
water projects. As another example, European governments support certain exports into thirdcountries using specific export credit guarantees if no other insurance is available for suchexports. In connection with the OECD Consensus, these ECAs introduced ECA-specific rules andregulations. We have to comply with these different terms and conditions in order to benefitfrom the ECA support. Because of our manufacturing locations in the USA and Canada, we canalso be supported by US and Canadian ECAs for which again the OECD Consensus, but alsonational ECA-specific rules and regulations apply. Our customers also use various sources of fundsto finance their projects, such as loans from commercial banks, bonds, (multilateral) developmentbanks, other financial institutions, public bodies or private investors. These entities and theirfinancing products can be subject to rules and regulations of financial regulators, central banksand other entities with regulatory power.
There is a trend that providers of funds, including public body lenders, ECAs and development
banks, are introducing environmental and social governance frameworks and related lendingpolicies to increase their funding of renewable energy and climate change mitigation projects. Atthe same time, many of them reduce financial support for fossil fuel based power plants or makeit subject to the plant meeting certain obligations regarding emissions. One example relevant toour business is the World Bank’s decisions to end financing of coal-fired power plants in 2013 andto end financial support for oil and gas extraction in 2020 in principle. Also the EIB hasannounced it will cease funding energy projects based on fossil fuels, including new gas plants,by the end of 2021 and only allow funding for certain low-emission gas projects with emissionsnot exceeding 250 g CO
2per kWh. Currently, the USA supports fossil fuel based operations
through things like tax advantages, but in 2019, several bills were introduced into the legislativeprocess which aim at reforming or repealing support for fossil fuels, such as the Clean Energy forAmerica Act or the Energy Sector Innovation Credit Act. As of the date of this Prospectus, thesehad not yet been adopted. Governments of certain Canadian provinces allow companies to payreduced royalty for the extraction of natural gas in order to encourage investments in gasextraction technology.
13.5.3.2 State Aid
Occasionally, we carry out or participate in projects that are partly financed by public funds, most
recently in Germany, Canada and China. These projects usually have an energy-relatedbackground such as installation of space reductions for grid connections, waste heat recovery oruse of hydrogen in manufacturing processes. Within the past three fiscal years, we have receivedgovernment grants in an overall amount of less than €30 million for such projects per year.
In the EU, any state aid has to comply with EU state aid rules which require the respective EU
member state to notify and seek approval from the EU Commission. Whenever we benefit frompublic grants we have to comply with different terms and conditions of grant decisions andapplicable collateral clauses, in particular regarding the use of funds for specific fundingpurposes, documentation obligations, employment commitments, exploitation periods and/ortransfer restrictions, as the case may be. Failure to comply with the notification requirement orwith the terms and conditions of the grant decisions may result in an obligation to repay the aid.Similarly, in Canada, government financing programs provide public funds for certain projects, inparticular R&D funding. In China, the Anti-monopoly Law prohibits the abuse of administrativepowers to eliminate or restrict competition and related law enforcement practice.
13.6 Data Privacy
We are subject to stringent data privacy regulations, inter alia , with respect to the collection,
storage, use and disclosure of personal data. Although we predominantly operate in a B2Benvironment where our customers are not usually end consumers but legal entities outside thescope of data privacy legislation in most countries, nevertheless our customer service may includeprocessing of personal data on behalf of our customers (such as customers’ employee data, dataof third parties acting on our customers’ behalf or personal data of our customers’ end
399
consumers). The same applies mutatis mutandis to our suppliers. In addition, our systems and
products process different types and special categories of personal data, for example with respectto employees we deal with data regarding health, religious beliefs trade union memberships, anddisabilities. We may also deal with personal data of other natural persons having a legitimateinterest, consent or other legal basis to our business.
Privacy regulations establish complex, multi-jurisdictional regulatory frameworks on a variety of
subjects including the circumstances under which we may process the personal data. This complexframework involves (i) conflicting privacy laws and regulations in different countries, (ii) thecircumstances under which processing of sensitive information is permitted without consent ofthe data subject, (iii) rights of the data subject to access, delete and correct its personal data,(iv) requirements to notify the data subject of privacy practices for personal data and(v) administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that process personaldata.
For example, when processing personal data in the European Economic Area we are subject to
the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“ GDPR ”) and respective implementing
legislation under national laws of member states, like in Germany the Federal Data ProtectionAct ( Bundesdatenschutzgesetz ,“BDSG ”). Both the GDPR and BDSG have been applicable since
May 25, 2018. The GDPR has significantly changed the legal framework for data protection in theEU and triggered additional compliance efforts and costs for German companies in general. Alarge part of our data processing operations consist of exchanges of personal data among ourgroup companies in different countries (“ Intragroup Exchange ”). Intragroup Exchange of
personal data to a country outside the European Economic Area for which the EU Commissionhas not recognized an adequate level of data protection (“ Third Country ”) is only permissible if
the recipient in the Third Country ensures adequate safeguards for the protection of personaldata. Regarding data transfers to the USA, the European Court of Justice in a judgement ofJuly 16, 2020 ( Schrems II ) annulled the EU-US Privacy Shield as basis for such transfer. Tranfers to
any Third Country can henceforth only be based on standard contractual clauses (“ SCC”) or
binding corporate rules (“ BCR”). However, in view of the court even SCCs require the data
exporter and the data importer to verify the adequate level of protection in the Third Countryand where necessary take supplementary measures or suspend data transfers. In view of theEuropean Data Protection Board, this also applies to BCR. As of the date of this Prospectus, weare assessing in which cases supplementary measures may be required or the ways we processpersonal data may have to be adjusted and closely monitor the guidance expected to beprovided by the data protection authorities on the consequences of the judgement.
We have implemented different measures in order to achieve compliance (including, but not
limited to, adjustments of internal processes, safeguarding of internal and external datatransfers, entering into data protection contracts, and monitoring by our legal and complianceteam) and are further developing our data protection systems, procedures and organization, forexample by designation of data protection officers where required by data protection laws orinternal data privacy managers in other jurisdictions. For the Intragroup Exchange of personaldata to a Third Country, we will use the Siemens AG Binding Corporate Rules by signing adoptionagreements alike SGRE. These apply to and are mandatory for (i) units of Siemens Energy AG andits affiliated companies located within the EEA, and (ii) affiliated companies located outside theEEA if the personal data originate from (a) Siemens Energy AG or (b) affiliated companies locatedwithin the EEA. In addition, we use an intercompany agreement for protection of personal datain company-wide IT systems (“ Framework Agreement Personal Data ”), which applies among and
between all Siemens Energy AG group companies. The Framework Agreement Personal Dataregulates processing and use of personal data as well as technical and organizational measures toprotect such data in accordance with data protection requirements. The GDPR introducedsubstantial sanctions for non-compliance. A violation of obligations under the GDPR mayconstitute an administrative offense which can result in fines or investigative measures imposedby the competent data protection authority as well as civil liabilities or even criminal sanctions.The IT application to which the Framework Agreement Personal Data applies is specified anddescribed in a data processing description, which together with the Framework Agreement
400
Personal Data forms the data processing agreement between and among the Siemens Energy AG
companies on processing personal data for a specified IT application.
Regarding our business in the USA, we are subject to numerous federal and state privacy laws
with general prohibitions on unfair or deceiving practices, including the prohibition to handlepersonal data in an unexpected manner and including data protection for specific sectors. Thereare specific rules on cybersecurity and notification requirements in case of a data breach. Eachstate has developed its own data breach notification requirements. Data privacy and protectionlaws are evolving in the U.S. and can vary significantly. For example, California recentlyimplemented the California Consumer Privacy Act (“ CCPA ”) which added further requirements
and penalties in the collection of California residents’ personal data. The CCPA applies tobusinesses collecting personal data of California residents and requires them to disclose how theyprocess the personal data of California residents. Furthermore, the CCPA provides Californiaresidents with additional data privacy rights including the right to access and delete theirpersonal data. Federal and state regulators are actively enforcing these requirements. Theauthorities may for non-compliance with federal or state privacy laws impose substantial fines. Inaddition, private parties may start lawsuits, including class-actions, based on tort law andstandards relating to unfair and deceptive acts and practices.
Private sector organizations in Canada are governed by both federal and provincial privacy laws.
The federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“ PIPEDA ”) applies to
personal information related to commercial activities, i.e., customers, vendors and business
partners. PIPEDA neither applies to personal information of employees nor to provinces that havesubstantially similar legislation. As of the date of this Prospectus, similar legislation is in place inthe provinces of Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta, with Ontario, New Brunswick, NovaScotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador having privacy legislation for health information whichhas been declared substantially similar to PIPEDA. All other provinces have not enactedsubstantially similar health information legislation and are, therefore, subject to PIPEDA. Inaddition, some provinces have passed privacy laws that apply to employee information. As of thedate of this Prospectus, these provinces are Alberta and British Columbia. In all cases, bothfederal and provincial privacy laws must be adhered to. PIPEDA requires organizations operatingin Canada to nominate a data privacy officer and implement a privacy panel as well as havingdata breach notification policies and procedures in place. Our Canadian companies have adoptedthe most stringent data protection requirements in order to avoid having to implement differentpolicies and procedures in provinces having their own substantially similar data privacy laws.
Regarding our activities in China, we are bound by Chinese data privacy law which consists of
numerous and industry-specific regulations complemented by standards. In addition, data privacyconsiderations can be inferred from general principles of civil law including tort law. The legallandscape is complex and subject to frequent changes. Therefore, uncertainty remains as to thespecific application of Chinese data privacy law as well as to the practical steps needed in orderto achieve compliance. On March 6, 2020, China’s State Administration for Market Supervisionand State Standardisation published revised personal data protection best practice guidelinescomprising recommended national standards for personal information security and aims toregulate the collection, storage, use, sharing, transfer and disclosure of personal information.
13.7 Anti-Bribery, Anti-Corruption, Antitrust and Competition
We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, antitrust and competitionlaws. Any violation of these laws in any jurisdiction in which we operate may have seriousconsequences for entities and/or individuals participating in such misconduct. For example, underGerman criminal law we must adhere to rules against corruption and bribery of public officials(Sections 332, 334 of the German Criminal Code ( Strafgesetzbuch )) or private sector employees or
business representatives (Section 299 of the German Criminal Code) as well as rules against thetaking and giving of bribes meant as an incentive to violating one’s official duties (Sections 331,333 of the German Criminal Code). These provisions may under certain conditions also apply tocircumstances that occur solely or partly on foreign territory. On June 16, 2020, the German
401
Federal Government adopted a bill revising the overall framework for sanctioning corporations
(Verbandssanktionengesetz ) including increased fines, which is now going through the legislative
process. Furthermore, the UK Bribery Act 2010 established company liability for corrupt actscommitted by persons acting on behalf of the company. The act prohibits bribery of publicofficials and business-to-business bribery. With global jurisdiction, companies can be held liablein the UK for acts of corruption committed by employees, agents or subsidiaries anywhere in theworld. In the USA, under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (“ FCPA ”), it is
also prohibited to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining orretaining business. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA now also apply to foreign firms andpersons who cause, directly or through agents, an act in furtherance of such a corrupt paymentto take place within the territory of the United States. The Chinese Criminal Law prohibits“official bribery” which applies to a state functionary or an entity as well as “commercialbribery” which applies to non-state functionaries. Under the Brazilian Criminal Code andBrazilian Anti-Bribery Law, individuals and legal entities can be liable for bribery of publicofficials in Brazil.
We are also subject to various antitrust and competition laws. In a broader sense these laws
include all legal provisions that concern the protection of a diverse and free competition.Antitrust law, in particular, aims to protect free competition. National and supranationalauthorities that monitor compliance with antitrust and competition laws may initiateinvestigations and proceedings into alleged infringements, such as anti-competitive agreementsbetween undertakings or the abuse of a dominant market position. Violations of antitrust andcompetition laws can have various consequences including criminal sanctions, administrativefines, disgorgement of profits, exclusion from public tenders, nullity of agreements and civilclaims for damages. Antitrust and competition laws in individual jurisdictions may also includerules requiring the approval by antitrust authorities regarding mergers and acquisitions or jointventures and enable the authorities to impose certain conditions or obligations in these cases.

14 GENERAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY AND THE
SIEMENS ENERGY GROUP
14.1 Formation, Incorporation, Commercial Register, Name
The Company was established by Blitzstart Holding AG on July 27, 2016 under the legal name
“Blitz 16-806 GmbH” in the form of a limited liability company ( Gesellschaft mit beschränkter
Haftung ) under German law and registered in the commercial register of the local court
(Amtsgericht ) of Munich under HRB 227428. Siemens acquired all shares of the Company on
August 9, 2016. Subsequently, the Company’s legal name was changed to “Kyros 52 GmbH” andits statutory seat was moved to Hanover where it was registered in the commercial register of thelocal court ( Amtsgericht ) of Hanover under HRB 215360. In preparation of the Spin-Off, the
Company’s legal form was changed to a stock corporation ( Aktiengesellschaft ), its seat was
moved to Munich and its legal name was changed to “Siemens Energy AG”. As of the date of theProspectus, the Company is registered in the commercial register of the local court ( Amtsgericht )
of Munich under HRB 252581.
The Company’s commercial name is “Siemens Energy”. In addition, some of the Company’s
subsidiaries use other commercial names reflecting other important Group brands, in particular“Siemens Gamesa”.
14.2 Our History
As Siemens Energy, we continue Siemens’ history in the energy business which began over 150years ago. Its technological origins are marked by an innovation with which Werner von Siemensrevolutionized electrical engineering in 1866. Building on the work of Michael Faraday, hediscovered the dynamoelectric principle and designed the predecessor of modern largegenerators: the dynamo machine. After around ten years of development and testing, thedynamo machine was ready for series production in 1875. This was the beginning of a new era inthe history of electrical engineering. The possibility of being able to generate and distributeelectrical energy in large quantities in an economical way fundamentally changed the economy.1866 can therefore rightly be regarded as the actual founding year of Siemens Energy. Sincethen, many technological milestones, of which only a small selection is mentioned here, are partof our heritage.
The construction and equipping of conventional power plants is the first pillar. In 1881,
Siemens & Halske supplied electrical equipment including generators for the world’s first publicpower plant in the southern English town of Godalming. In 1897, South Africa’s first publicpower plant was completed and many other power plant projects followed. Power engineeringalso contributed to Siemens’ return to world markets after World War I: In 1929, the Ardnacrushahydroelectric power plant on the Shannon River went into operation, thus ensuring theelectrification of the free state of Ireland. At almost the same time, Siemens built the West PowerPlant in Berlin with a capacity of 228 megawatts (MW), the most modern thermal power plant inEurope at the time. After World War II in 1956, the first Siemens gas turbine, the “VM1,” wastested in Muelheim an der Ruhr.
In the mid-1950s, Siemens entered the nuclear business with its first test facilities and in 1969
received an order to build the world’s then largest nuclear power plant in Biblis near Worms,Germany. In 1969, Siemens and AEG founded Kraftwerk Union AG, into which both partiestransferred their nuclear technology operations in 1973 and which Siemens fully consolidatedinto Siemens AG after AEG’s withdrawal in 1987. In 2011, Siemens decided to discontinue itsbusiness activities in turnkey nuclear power plants.
In 2002, as part of Siemens’ acquisition of Mannesmann Atecs AG, Siemens acquired the
turbocompressor business of Mannesmann Demag Delaval. This business was merged into theindustrial turbines and power plants division. In 2003, Siemens purchased Alstom IndustrialTurbines; a manufacturer of small, medium and industrial gas turbines. In 2018, Siemenscompleted work on the world’s three largest CCPPs in Egypt which increased power generation
403
capacity by 14.4 GW – enough to reliably and efficiently supply up to 40 million people with
electrical energy.
Transmission technology has long been a second important pillar for Siemens, in which it has
always sought to set standards. Prominent examples of its contribution to the field include thedevelopment of the expansion switch in 1930 or the first SF
6high-voltage switch in 1964. These
and other developments significantly contributed to efficient, reliable and flexible powerdistribution. An important highlight was the construction of the first HVDC transmission systemin 1975, which supported Siemens’ strong technology and market position in power transmission.In 2015, Siemens, working in a consortium with the Italian cable manufacturer Prysmian, installedthe first offshore grid connection worldwide that began commercial operations using high-voltage DC transmission technology.
In 1978, the construction at the time of the world’s largest hydroelectric power plant Italpú in
Brazil on the border between Brazil and Paraguay demonstrated the potential renewables canhave for electricity generation – a third important pillar of our offering. In 1994, a ceramic high-temperature fuel cell from Siemens achieved an output of 1.8 kilowatts (KW) for the first timeworldwide. In 2012, we built the world’s then largest rotor for the 6-MW offshore wind powerplant near Østerild in Denmark. Finally, in 2019, the world’s largest pilot plant for carbon-neutralproduction of hydrogen at that time (source: Power Engineering International, “World’s largest“green” hydrogen pilot begins operation in Austria”, November 19, 2019) went into operation inLinz, Austria.
In addition to these technological developments, the Siemens Energy business has also reached
numerous organizational milestones: The success of heavy current engineering stronglysupported the business of Siemens & Halske. Halske’s heavy current department merged withElektrizitäts-Aktiengesellschaft (EAG) to form Siemens-Schuckertwerke GmbH. The two worldwars were followed by a phase of reconstruction and corporate consolidation, which culminatedin the founding of Siemens AG in 1966. In 1998, Siemens acquired the fossil fuel power plantbusiness of the American Westinghouse group, thereby expanding its conventional power plantbusiness. In 2004, the acquisition of the Danish company Bonus Energy A/S laid the foundationfor success in the wind power business. In 2014, Siemens acquired the Rolls-Royce aero-derivativegas turbine and compressor business, thereby broadening its position in the oil and gas industry.In 2015, Siemens closed its acquisition of the U.S. company Dresser-Rand, a leading provider ofcompressors, steam and gas turbines.

The bonds may be issued in exchange for contributions in cash and/or consideration in kind.
Warrant bonds may be issued in exchange for consideration in kind to the extent that the termsand conditions of the warrants provide for full payment in cash of the option price per SiemensEnergy Conversion Share upon exercise.

The authorization for the issue of bonds expires on July 31, 2025.The terms and conditions of the bonds may also provide for a conversion obligation at the end of
the term (or at an earlier date or a specific event).

In the case of warrant bonds, option rights shall be attached to each bond certificate, in
particular in the form of one or more warrants, entitling the holder/creditor to subscribe toSiemens Energy Conversion Shares, subject to the terms and conditions of the bonds. In the case
413
of convertible bonds, the holders/creditors of the convertible bonds shall be entitled and/or
obliged to convert them into Siemens Energy Conversion Shares, subject to the terms andconditions of the bonds. In all cases, the conversion ratio or the exchange or subscription ratio isobtained by dividing the principal amount or the lower issue price of a convertible bond, or if awarrant is exercised, the amount owed under its terms and conditions, by the conversion oroption price stipulated for one Siemens Energy Conversion Share. The pro rata amount of theshare capital represented by the shares to be subscribed for on the basis of one convertible bondor, in the case of an exchange, of one warrant bond, must not exceed the principal amount orthe lower issue price of the bond.
The conversion/option price per share applicable at the time of issue must, except in cases of a
conversion obligation, not be less than 80.0% of the price of the Shares as quoted in Xetratrading (or a comparable successor system). The calculation shall be based on the average closingprice over the ten trading days prior to the date on which the Executive Board finally resolves toissue the bonds or on the Company’s notice of acceptance following a public request forsubmission of subscription offers. If shareholders’ subscription rights are not excluded, the priceon the trading days during the subscription period can be used as the basis instead (with theexception of the days in the subscription period necessary to publish the conversion/option priceon time in accordance with Section 186 paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act(Aktiengesetz )). In cases of bonds with a conversion obligation, the conversion price may at least
either equal the minimum price set out above or correspond to the average volume-weightedprice of the Shares in Xetra trading (or a comparable successor system) on at least three tradingdays immediately prior to calculation of the conversion price as defined in more detail by theterms and conditions of the bonds, even if this average price and the applicable conversion pricederived from it is below the minimum price (80.0%) set out above. Section 9 paragraph 1 andSection 199 paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ) remain unaffected.
The authorization also includes the option, subject to the terms and conditions of the bonds, to
provide dilution protection and/or other adjustments under certain circumstances. Dilutionprotection or other adjustments may be provided for in particular if the Company changes itscapital structure during the term of the bonds and/or warrants ( e.g., through a capital increase, a
capital decrease or a stock split), but also in connection with dividend payouts, the issue ofadditional convertible and/or warrant bonds, transformation measures and in the case of otherevents affecting the value of the option or conversion rights or obligations that may occur duringthe term of the bonds and/or warrants ( e.g., control gained by a third party). Dilution protection
or other adjustments may be provided in particular by granting subscription rights, byadjustments of the conversion/option price as well as by amending or introducing cashcomponents.
The Executive Board is authorized to determine the terms of issue and further terms and
conditions of the bonds or to establish such terms and conditions by mutual agreement with therespective issuing consolidated subsidiary. In particular, the terms and conditions of the bondsmay also provide for and stipulate the following:
 whether and under what conditions ( e.g., at the discretion of the issuer or the Company)
servicing may occur from conditional capital (in particular from the Conditional Capital 2020created in connection with this authorization), from authorized capital, from treasury shares,or instead of delivery of Siemens Energy Conversion Shares by paying compensation for thevalue in cash or delivery of other securities that can be traded at a trading venue within themeaning of Section 2 paragraph 22 of the German Securities Trading Act(Wertpapierhandelsgesetz ),

attached to each bond certificate and whether they are detachable when or after being issued,
 interest and term (be it unlimited or different) for the bonds or warrants, features of the bond component, which in particular may include hybrid bonds,
414
 whether, in the case of warrant bonds, the option price may be paid in whole or in part by
transfer of bond certificates (as payment),
 whether the conversion/option prices or the conversion/subscription or exchange ratios are to
be determined when the bonds are issued or during the term of the bonds or warrants andhow these prices/ratios are to be defined (in each case including any minimum and maximumprices and variable features or computation on the basis of future market prices); therequirements regarding the conversion/option price per Share described above remainunaffected,
 whether and how a conversion ratio should be rounded, whether an additional cash payment or a compensation in cash should be specified, in the case of mandatory conversions, how details are to be determined regarding the exercise,
fulfillment of obligations or rights, deadlines and determination of conversion or option prices,
 whether the bonds should be issued in euros or in the legal currency of an OECD country other

16.6 Authorizations to Acquire and Use Treasury Shares; Treasury Shares
Held
In the Spin-Off and Transfer Agreement, Siemens AG undertook to ensure that the Company will
be authorized to acquire and use treasury shares as further specified in the Spin-Off and TransferAgreement for the time period after Spin-Off Completion. Therefore, Siemens as shareholder ofthe Company will ensure to convene an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting prior to Spin-OffCompletion and to resolve to grant the following authorization.
1. The Company is authorized to repurchase Shares until the expiration of July 31, 2025, for
every permissible purpose, up to a limit of 10.0% of its share capital as of the time theresolution takes effect or as of the date on which the authorization is exercised, if the lattervalue is lower. The total number of Shares repurchased under this authorization and anyother Shares previously acquired and still held in treasury by the Company or attributable tothe Company pursuant to Section 71d, Section 71e of the German Stock Corporation Act(Aktiengesetz ) may at no time exceed 10.0% of the respective share capital.
2. Any repurchase of Shares shall be accomplished at the discretion of the Executive Board
either (1) by acquisition on the stock exchange, (2) through a public share repurchase offeror (3) through a public offer to swap Shares for shares in a listed company within themeaning of Section 3 paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ).
Offers under subsections (2) and (3) above can also be solicited by a request for submissionof offers.
a. If the Shares are to be acquired on the stock exchange, the purchase price paid on the
stock exchange per Share (excluding incidental transaction charges) may neither exceedthe stock market price of a Share on the trading day, as determined during the openingauction in Xetra trading (or a comparable successor system), by more than 10.0% nor fallbelow such market price by more than 20.0%.
b. If the Shares are to be acquired through a public share repurchase offer, the purchase
price paid per Share (excluding incidental transaction charges) may neither exceed theaverage closing price of a Share in Xetra trading (or a comparable successor system) onthe fourth, third and second trading day prior to the decision by the Executive Boardregarding the offer or acceptance of offers made by the shareholders, by more than10.0% nor fall below such closing price by more than 20.0%.
c. If the Shares are to be acquired through a public offer to swap Shares for shares in a
listed company within the meaning of Section 3 paragraph 2 of the German StockCorporation Act ( Aktiengesetz )( “exchange shares ”), the exchange price paid by the
Company (in the form of one or more exchange shares, any arithmetic fractions and anycash component) per Share (excluding incidental transaction charges) may neitherexceed the relevant value of a Share by more than 10.0% nor fall below the relevantvalue of a Share by more than 20.0%. The basis for calculating this relevant value foreach Share and for each exchange share is in each case the average closing price in Xetratrading (or a comparable successor system) on the fourth, third and second trading dayprior to the decision by the Executive Board regarding the offer or acceptance of offersmade by the shareholders. If the exchange shares are not traded in Xetra trading (or acomparable successor system), the relevant value shall be the closing price on the stockexchange where the exchange shares recorded their highest trading volume in thepreceding full calendar year.
The Executive Board shall define the arrangements for acquiring the Shares in more detail. If
the number of Shares tendered or offered by shareholders for purchase or exchange exceedsthe total volume which the Company intends to repurchase, the shareholders’ tender rightmay be excluded to the extent that the repurchase will be in proportion to the Sharestendered or offered by each shareholder. Furthermore, the tender, acceptance or offer of
416
small quantities of up to 150 Shares per shareholder may receive preferential treatment and
rounding according to commercial principles may be provided for.
If, after the publication of an offer, the market price differs from the price or from a price
range defined in connection with a request for submission of offers and these differencesmay be material to the success of the offer, the price or the price range may be adjustedduring the submission period or up to acceptance. In this case the provision that thepurchase or exchange price may neither exceed the relevant value of a Share by more than10.0% nor fall below it by more than 20.0% refers to the respective closing price of theShare, and potentially the exchange share, on the last trading day prior to the ultimatedecision of the Executive Board on the adjustment.
3. The Executive Board is authorized to use any Shares repurchased on the basis of this
authorization – in addition to selling them on the stock exchange or through an offer to allshareholders proportionately according to their percentage of ownership – for everypermissible purpose, in particular as follows:
a. Such Shares may be cancelled without an additional resolution by the Company’s
shareholders’ meeting being required for such cancellation or its implementation. Suchcancellation leads to a capital decrease; in this case, the Executive Board is authorized toreduce the share capital by the pro rata amount of the share capital attributable to thecancelled shares and the Supervisory Board is authorized to adjust the number of sharesand the share capital in the Articles of Association accordingly. The cancellation canupon decision by the Executive Board pursuant to Section 237 paragraph 3 no. 3 of theGerman Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ) also be carried out without a capital
decrease by adjusting the pro rata amount of the other shares of no par value relative tothe Company’s share capital pursuant to Section 8 paragraph 3 of the German StockCorporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ). In this case, the Executive Board is authorized to adjust
the number of shares of no par value specified in the Articles of Association.
b. Such Shares may be used in connection with share-based compensation programs and/or
employee share programs of the Company or any of its affiliated companies and issuedto individuals currently or formerly employed by the Company or any of its affiliatedcompanies as well as to board members of any of the Company’s affiliated companies. Inparticular, the Shares may be offered for acquisition, awarded and transferred for freeor against payment to said persons and board members, provided that the employmentrelationship or board membership must exist at the time of the offer, awardcommitment or transfer.
c. Such Shares may, with approval of the Supervisory Board, be sold against payment in
cash if the selling price is not significantly lower than the stock market price of a Share.The part of the share capital mathematically attributable to the shares used in this waymust not exceed 10.0% of the share capital. The share capital at the time theauthorization takes effect or, if this amount is lower, at the time at which thisauthorization is used, shall apply. When determining this limit, shares shall also be takeninto account which, during the term of this authorization to acquire shares until its use,are issued in direct or mutatis mutandis application of Section 186 paragraph 3 sentence
4 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ). The same applies to shares to be
issued or granted on the basis of a convertible bond or warrant bond issued during theterm of this authorization to acquire shares, with shareholders’ subscription rightsexcluded in accordance with the provisions of Section 186 paragraph 3 sentence 4 of theGerman Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ).
d. Such Shares may be used to service or secure obligations or rights to acquire Shares
arising particularly from or in connection with convertible bonds or warrant bonds ofthe Company or its consolidated subsidiaries. Moreover, the Executive Board shall beauthorized to exclude subscription rights in order to grant holders/creditors ofconversion or option rights or respective conversion obligations on Shares subscriptionrights as compensation against effects of dilution to the extent to which they would be
417
entitled after exercise of such rights or fulfillment of such obligations, and to use Shares
to service such subscription rights.
e. Such Shares may be used to list Shares on foreign stock exchanges on which they are
currently not admitted to trading. The price at which these shares are floated on foreignstock exchanges must not be more than 5.0% lower than the arithmetic mean of theprices (excluding incidental transaction charges) of the Shares in the closing auction inXetra trading (or a comparable successor system) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchangeduring the last three stock exchange trading days prior to the Shares being floated onthe foreign stock exchange.
4. The Supervisory Board shall be authorized to use Shares acquired on the basis of this
authorization as follows: such shares may be used to service obligations or rights to acquireShares that were or will be agreed with members of the Executive Board within theframework of rules governing Executive Board compensation. In particular, they may beoffered for acquisition, awarded and transferred to members of the Executive Board,provided that the employment relationship or board membership exists at the time of theoffer, award commitment or transfer.
5. The authorizations in this resolution may be exercised independently of each other, once or
several times, solely or jointly, in whole or in part also by any of the Company’s consolidatedsubsidiaries or by third parties acting on behalf of the Company or any of its consolidatedsubsidiaries. In addition, acquired Shares may also be transferred to consolidatedsubsidiaries.
6. Shareholders’ subscription rights relating to repurchased Shares shall be excluded to the
extent to which such Shares are used in accordance with the authorizations pursuant tosection 3. lit (b) through (e) and section 4. above. In addition, the subscription right withregard to fractional amounts may be excluded from an offer to acquire Shares made to allshareholders.
As of the date of the Prospectus, the Company does not hold any treasury shares.
16.7 General Provisions Governing a Liquidation of the Company
Apart from a liquidation as a result of insolvency proceedings, the Company may be liquidated
only with a vote of 75.0% or more of the share capital represented at the general shareholders’meeting at which such vote is taken. Pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act(Aktiengesetz ), in the event of the Company’s liquidation, any assets remaining after all of the
Company’s liabilities have been settled will be distributed pro rata among its shareholders. The
German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ) provides certain protections for creditors which
must be observed in the event of liquidation.
16.8 General Provisions Governing Share Capital Increases and Decreases
The German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ) provides that the share capital of a stock
corporation may be increased by a resolution of the general shareholders’ meeting. Suchresolution must be adopted by a majority of at least 75.0% of the share capital represented whenthe resolution is passed unless the stock corporation’s articles of association provide for adifferent majority. Our Articles of Association provide in Section 17 para. 2 that the resolutions ofthe general shareholders’ meeting are adopted by a simple majority of the votes cast unlessmandatory law or the articles of association require a higher majority or additional requirements(which is currently not the case under the Articles of Association of the Company). In addition,shareholders may resolve to issue authorized capital by a vote of 75.0% of the share capitalrepresented at the passing of the resolution authorizing the Executive Board to issue Shares, upto a specific amount within a period not exceeding five years. The nominal amount of suchissuance may not exceed 50.0% of the share capital in existence at the time of the authorization,that is, at the time the authorized capital is entered into the commercial register.
418
Additionally, shareholders may resolve to create contingent capital for the purpose of issuing
Shares (i) to holders of convertible bonds or other securities convertible into Shares of theCompany, (ii) as consideration in connection with a merger with another company or (iii) toexecutives and employees. A resolution to create contingent capital must be adopted by at least75.0% of the share capital represented at the passing of the resolution. The nominal amount ofthe contingent capital created for the purpose of share issues to executives and employees maynot exceed 10.0%, a contingent capital created for any other purpose may not exceed 50.0% ofthe nominal share capital in existence at the time such resolution is passed. The creation ofcontingent capital beyond this threshold is permitted only for the purpose of enabling thecompany to make an exchange in the event of its impending insolvency or for the purpose ofaverting over indebtedness.
A resolution to reduce the share capital must be adopted by at least 75.0% of the share capital
represented at the passing of the resolution.
16.9 General Provisions on Subscription Rights
According to the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ), every shareholder is generally
entitled to subscription rights to any new shares issued within the framework of a capitalincrease, including convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, profit-sharing rights or incomebonds. Such subscription rights are freely transferable and may generally be traded on Germanstock exchanges within a specified period prior to the expiration of such period.
The general shareholders’ meeting may pass a resolution excluding subscription rights if at least
75.0% of the share capital represented adopts the resolution. To exclude subscription rights, theExecutive Board must also make a report available to the shareholders justifying the exclusionand demonstrating that the Company’s interest in excluding the subscription rights outweighsthe shareholders’ interest in keeping them. The exclusion of subscription rights upon the issuanceof new Shares is permitted, in particular, if the Company increases the share capital against cashcontributions, the amount of the capital increase does not exceed 10.0% of the existing sharecapital and the issue price of the new Shares is not significantly lower than the stock exchangeprice of the Company’s existing shares.
16.10 Exclusion of Minority Shareholders
Under the rules of Sections 327a et seq . of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz )
regarding the so-called “squeeze-out” of minority shareholders, the general meeting of a stockcorporation may resolve upon request by a shareholder who holds 95.0% of the share capital(majority shareholder) that the shares held by the remaining minority shareholders betransferred to the majority shareholder against payment of adequate cash compensation. Theamount of the cash compensation to be granted to the minority shareholders must reflect thesituation of the company at the time the resolution is adopted by the general meeting. For thepurpose of calculating the compensation amount, the full enterprise value is relevant and willgenerally be determined by applying the discounted future earnings method(Ertragswertmethode ). The minority shareholders are entitled to file for valuation proceedings
(Spruchverfahren ) in the course of which the appropriateness of the cash compensation is
reviewed.
Under the German Transformation Act ( Umwandlungsgesetz ), a majority shareholder holding at
least 90.0% of a stock corporation’s share capital can require the general shareholders’ meetingto resolve that the minority shareholders must sell their stock to the majority shareholder againstthe payment of adequate compensation in cash, provided that (i) the majority shareholder is astock corporation, a partnership limited by shares (KGaA), or a European stock corporation (SE)having its seat in Germany, and (ii) the squeeze-out is performed to facilitate a merger under theGerman Transformation Act ( Umwandlungsgesetz ) between the majority shareholder and the
stock corporation. The general shareholders’ meeting approving the squeeze-out must take placewithin three months of the conclusion of the merger agreement. The procedure for thesqueeze-out is essentially identical to the squeeze-out under stock corporation law described
419
above, including the minority shareholders’ right to have the appropriateness of the cash
compensation reviewed.
Furthermore, pursuant to the provisions in Sections 39a and 39b of the German Securities
Acquisition and Takeover Act ( Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz ) regarding the
so-called “takeover law squeeze-out”, a bidder who, following a takeover offer or a mandatorytender offer, holds at least 95.0% of the voting share capital of the target company may, withina period of three months following the expiration of the acceptance period, apply to theRegional Court ( Landgericht ) of Frankfurt am Main for a court order to transfer to such bidder
the remaining voting shares against payment of adequate compensation. No resolution of thegeneral meeting is required. The consideration granted under the takeover offer or themandatory tender offer is considered adequate compensation if the bidder, based on such offer,has acquired at least 90.0% of the share capital subject to the offer. Furthermore, following atakeover offer or a mandatory tender offer, the shareholders of the target company who did notaccept such offer may accept the offer within three months after the expiration of theacceptance period (so-called “sell-out”), provided the bidder is entitled to file an application forthe transfer of the remaining voting shares in accordance with Section 39a of the GermanSecurities Acquisition and Takeover Act ( Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz ) (Section 39c
of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act ( Wertpapiererwerbs- und
Übernahmegesetz )).
Pursuant to the provisions of Sections 319 et seq . of the German Stock Corporation Act
(Aktiengesetz ) regarding the integration ( Eingliederung ) of a subsidiary, the general meeting of
a stock corporation may resolve the integration into another company provided that the futureprincipal company ( Hauptgesellschaft ) is a German stock corporation and holds at least 95.0% of
the shares of the company to be integrated. The shareholders of the integrated company areentitled to adequate compensation, which is generally to be granted in the form of shares of theprincipal company. The amount of compensation is to be determined by the so-called “mergervalue ratio” ( Verschmelzungswertrelation ) between the companies, i.e., the exchange ratio
which would have to be considered adequate in the event of a merger of the two companies.
16.11 Mandatory Takeover Bids
Pursuant to the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act ( Wertpapiererwerbs- und
Übernahmegesetz ), every person whose share of voting rights reaches or exceeds 30.0% of the
voting shares of the Company (after admission of the Company’s shares to trading on theregulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) must, within seven calendar days, publish thisfact, including the percentage of its voting rights, on the Internet and through electronic mediafor disseminating financial information. Subsequently, and unless an exemption from thisobligation has been granted by BaFin, such person must submit a mandatory public tender offerto all shareholders of the Company. The German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act(Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz ) contains several rules that provide for an
attribution and aggregation of voting rights in order to ensure that the shares are attributed tothe person actually controlling the voting rights attached thereto. If a person fails to give noticeof reaching or exceeding the 30.0% threshold or fails to submit a mandatory public tender offer,shareholder rights (including voting rights and, in certain cases, the right to collect dividends andliquidation proceeds) are suspended for the duration of non-compliance under certaincircumstances. In addition, a fine may be imposed.
16.12 Disclosure Requirements for Holdings of Shares and Other Instruments
After the Company’s Shares have been admitted to trading on the regulated market ( Regulierter
Markt ) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Company, as a listed company, and its shareholders
will become subject to the provisions of the German Securities Trading Act(Wertpapierhandelsgesetz ) governing disclosure requirements for shareholdings.
Section 33 of the German Securities Trading Act ( Wertpapierhandelsgesetz ) requires that anyone
who acquires, sells or whose shareholding in any other way reaches, exceeds or falls below 3.0%,
420
5.0%, 10.0%, 15.0%, 20.0%, 25.0%, 30.0%, 50.0% or 75.0% of the voting rights in an issuer
whose home country is Germany and whose shares are admitted to trading on an organizedmarket must immediately, and no later than within four trading days of such occurrence, notifythe issuer and at the same time BaFin. The notice period commences as soon as the personobliged to notify ( Meldepflichtiger ) knows, or, under the circumstances of the case should know,
that his or her voting rights reach, exceed or fall below the abovementioned thresholds, and nolater than two trading days after reaching, exceeding or falling below the threshold. Only in thecase where the voting rights reach, exceed or fall below the thresholds as a result of an eventaffecting all voting rights, then the notice period may commence at a later time. The notificationrequirement is set off by the establishment of an obligation to transfer such ownershipimmediately ( ohne zeitliche Verzögerung ).
Notice must be given using a standard form annexed to the German Securities Trading Reporting
Regulation ( Wertpapierhandelsanzeigeverordnung ). It must include the address of the individual
or entity, the share of voting rights held and the date of reaching, exceeding or falling below therespective threshold, and must be issued via a mandatory standard form. The Company mustpublish such notices immediately but no later than within three trading days after their receipt,via media outlets or outlets where it can be assumed that the notice will be disseminated in theEU (including, during the transitional period of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, the UnitedKingdom) and the non-EU parties to the agreement on the EEA (so-called “ Medienbündel ”). The
Company must also transmit the notice to BaFin and to the German Business Register(Unternehmensregister ) for storage.
For purposes of the notification requirements, the German Securities Trading Act
(Wertpapierhandelsgesetz ) contains various rules that require the attribution ( Zurechnung )o f
voting rights of certain persons associated with the shareholder or acting together with theshareholder. For example, shares held by a subsidiary (as defined in Section 35 of the GermanSecurities Trading Act ( Wertpapierhandelsgesetz )) are attributed to the parent company;
similarly, shares held by a third company for the account of another company are attributed tothe latter. Furthermore, any kind of cooperation among shareholders that is intended to effect apermanent and material change in the business strategy of the Company can result in anattribution of voting rights. This means that the cooperation does not necessarily have to concernthe exercise of voting rights specifically; coordination in individual cases, however, will nottrigger the attribution of voting rights.
Pursuant to Section 38 of the German Securities Trading Act ( Wertpapierhandelsgesetz ), similar
obligations to notify the Company and BaFin for reaching, exceeding or falling below theabovementioned thresholds (other than the 3.0% threshold) apply to direct and indirect holdersof certain instruments other than shares. This applies to instruments that grant upon maturity anunconditional right to acquire already issued voting shares of the Company, a discretionary rightto acquire such shares, or instruments that refer to such shares and have a similar economiceffect to the aforementioned instruments. Notifiable instruments include, inter alia , transferable
securities, options, futures contracts, swaps, forward rate agreements and contracts fordifference. The number of voting rights relevant for the notification requirement will generallybe calculated by reference to the full nominal amount of shares underlying the instrumentexcept where the instrument provides exclusively for a cash settlement. Details for suchcalculations are laid down in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 ofDecember 17, 2014.
Shares or instruments held for trading by a securities services company are not taken into account
for determining the notification obligation if it is ensured that the voting rights held by them arenot exercised, and that they amount to no more than 5.0% of the voting shares, or do not grantthe right to purchase more than 5.0% of the voting shares.
Notifiable holdings pursuant to Sections 33 and 38 of the German Securities Trading Act
(Wertpapierhandelsgesetz ) must be aggregated, leading to a notification obligation for total
holdings above a 5.0% threshold pursuant to Section 39 of the German Securities Trading Act(Wertpapierhandelsgesetz ).
421
Furthermore, a person obliged to notify ( Meldepflichtiger ) who reaches or exceeds the threshold
of 10.0% of the voting rights, or a higher threshold, is obligated to notify the issuer within 20trading days regarding the objective being pursued through the acquisition of voting rights, aswell as regarding the source of the funds used for the purchase pursuant to Section 43 of theGerman Securities Trading Act ( Wertpapierhandelsgesetz ). Changes in those objectives must also
be reported within 20 trading days. An issuer may stipulate in its Articles of Association that theaforementioned disclosure requirement does not apply.
In case that the disclosure requirements are not met, shareholder rights (including voting rights
and, in certain cases, the right to collect dividends and liquidation proceeds) are – subject tocertain exceptions – suspended for the duration of non-compliance. If the failure to comply withthe disclosure requirements specifically relates to the share of voting rights and is the result of awillful or grossly negligent conduct, the suspension period is extended by six months after theperson obliged to notify ( Meldepflichtiger ) files the required notification. In addition, a fine may
be imposed if a required notification is not at all, incorrectly or incompletely made, or not madein the right manner or in a timely fashion. BaFin also has the right to publish decisions onsanctions and measures with regard to violations of the disclosure obligations and personsresponsible for such violations.
16.13 Disclosure of Transactions of Persons Discharging Managerial
Responsibilities
Pursuant to Article 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 of April 16,
2014) (“ Market Abuse Regulation ”), persons discharging managerial responsibilities
(“Executives ”) shall notify the Company and BaFin of every transaction conducted on their own
account relating to shares or debt instruments of the Company or to derivatives or other financialinstruments linked thereto (so-called “directors’ dealings”). The same applies to persons closelyassociated with Executives who must notify the Company and BaFin if they enter into suchtransactions. Transactions that must be notified also include, among others, pledging or lendingof financial instruments, transactions undertaken by any person professionally arranging orexecuting transactions on behalf of an Executive or a closely associated person, including wherediscretion is exercised, as well as transactions made under a life insurance policy. The notificationrequirement applies to any subsequent transaction once a total amount of €20,000 has been
reached within a calendar year. Notification shall be made promptly and no later than threebusiness days after the date of the transaction.
For the purposes of the Market Abuse Regulation, Executive means a person within the Company
who is a member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the Company or asenior executive who is not such member but who has regular access to inside informationrelating directly or indirectly to the Company and who has power to take managerial decisionsaffecting the future developments and business prospects of the Company. A person closelyassociated with an Executive means certain family members, namely a spouse, a registered civilpartner ( eingetragener Lebenspartner ), a dependent child as well as a relative who has shared
the same household for at least one year on the date of the transaction concerned. A personclosely associated also includes a legal person, trust or partnership, the managerialresponsibilities of which are discharged by an Executive of the Company or by a family memberof his or hers. Finally, the term includes a legal person, trust or partnership which is directly orindirectly controlled by an Executive of the Company (or by one of its family members) or whichis set up for the benefit of such a person, or the economic interests of which are substantiallyequivalent to those of such a person.
The Company shall ensure that information of which it is notified is promptly made public. In any
case, it shall be made public no later than three business days after the transaction in a mannerwhich enables fast access to this information on a non-discriminatory basis in accordance withESMA’s implementing technical standards. Furthermore, according to the German SecuritiesTrading Act ( Wertpapierhandelsgesetz ), the Company shall without undue delay transmit the
information to the German Business Register ( Unternehmensregister ) and notify BaFin.
Non-compliance with the notification requirements may result in a fine.

17 Governing Bodies and Employees
17.1 Overview
The Company’s governing entities are its Executive Board, its Supervisory Board and the general
shareholders’ meeting ( Hauptversammlung ). The responsibilities of these entities are determined
by the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ), the Articles of Association, the internal
rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board ( Geschäftsordnung des Aufsichtsrats ) and the rules
of procedure for the Executive Board ( Geschäftsordnung des Vorstands ), which will be resolved in
the constituting session of the Supervisory Board following Spin-Off Completion.

The Articlesof Association or the Supervisory Board must, however, designate certain types of transactionsthat may only be undertaken with the approval of the Supervisory Board. Section 9 para. 2 of theCompany’s Articles of Association provides that the rules of procedure for the Company’sExecutive Board or Supervisory Board or resolutions of the Supervisory Board must make certaintransactions or types of transactions subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board. Matterssubject to the consent of the Supervisory Board are expected to include, among other things, theacquisition, disposal and transformation of companies, shareholdings and parts of companiesabove a certain threshold, the termination of the current area of business exceeding a certainrevenue share of total Group revenues of the preceding fiscal year and the conclusion offinancing agreements exceeding certain thresholds.
Members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board owe a duty of care, a duty of legality
and a duty of loyalty to the Company. Board members must consider a number of interests,including those of the Company and its shareholders, employees and creditors. The ExecutiveBoard must also take into consideration shareholders’ rights to equal treatment and equal accessto information. Should members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board breach theseduties, they will be jointly and severally liable to the Company for compensatory damages. TheDirectors’ and Officers’ (D&O) liability insurance policy which the Company intends to enter intowill provide financial loss coverage up to a certain amount for members of the Executive Boardand the Supervisory Board with regard to their activities. The Company will bear the cost of theseinsurance policies. However, it should be noted that applicable German law requires that each
424
member of the Company’s Executive Board remains personally responsible in the case of any
finding of personal liability of such member, as the case may be, for 10.0% of the total amountof such personal liability, up to an amount that equals 150.0% of such member’s total annualfixed remuneration.
Under German law, a shareholder is generally not able to take legal action against members of
the Executive Board or Supervisory Board if he or she believes that these persons have neglectedtheir duties towards the Company and this has resulted in damage to the Company. Companyclaims for compensatory damages against members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Boardmay, as a rule, only be asserted by the Company itself, in which case the Company is representedby the Executive Board when claims are made against members of the Supervisory Board and theSupervisory Board when claims are made against members of the Executive Board. According to aruling by the German Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ), the Supervisory Board is
obligated to assert claims for compensatory damages against the Executive Board that are likelyto be successful unless important Company interests would conflict with such an assertion ofclaims and such grounds outweigh, or are at least comparable to, the grounds in favor ofasserting claims. In the event that the competent corporate body decides not to pursue suchclaims, then such claims of the Company for compensatory damages must nevertheless beasserted against members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board if the generalshareholders’ meeting passes a resolution to this effect by a simple majority vote. The generalshareholders’ meeting may appoint a special representative to assert such claims. Shareholderswhose aggregate holdings amount to at least 10.0% or €1,000,000 of the Company’s share
capital may apply to the court to appoint a special representative to assert claims forcompensatory damages, who, in the event of such an appointment, becomes responsible for thismatter in place of the Company’s management. In addition, if there are facts supporting theclaim that the Company has been damaged by fraud or gross breaches of duty, shareholderswhose aggregate holdings amount to at least 1.0% or €100,000 of the Company’s share capital
have the option, under certain circumstances, of being granted permission by the competentcourt to file a lawsuit on their own behalf for compensatory damages for the Company againstmembers of the board. Such a lawsuit will be dismissed if the Company itself files a lawsuit forcompensatory damages.
The Company may only waive or settle any damage claims against members of the Executive
Board or Supervisory Board if three years have passed since the claims came into existence, andonly if a simple majority of the shareholders votes in favor of such waiver or settlement at theshareholders’ general meeting and provided that a minority of the shareholders whose sharescollectively reach the level of 10.0% of the share capital does not raise an objection which isentered in the minutes of the meeting.
Under German law, it is illegal for shareholders or any other individuals to attempt to influence
members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board, authorized representatives ( Prokuristen )
or other persons holding a commercial power of attorney to act in a way harmful to theCompany. Shareholders with a controlling influence may not use such influence to cause theCompany to act against its own best interests, unless any resulting damages are compensated for.Any person who uses his or her influence to cause a member of the Company’s Executive Boardor Supervisory Board, authorized representative or person holding a commercial power ofattorney to act in a manner harmful to the Company or its shareholders is obligated tocompensate the Company and its shareholders for any resulting damage. In addition, members ofthe Executive Board and Supervisory Board may be jointly and severally liable for breach of theirduties.

Dr.-Ing. Christian Bruch and Ms. Maria Ferraro were appointed as members of the Executive
Board with effect as of May 1, 2020. Dr.-Ing. Jochen Eickholt and Mr. Tim Oliver Holt wereappointed with effect as of April 1, 2020. Therefore, the current members of the Executive Boardreceived no compensation from the Company during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.See Note 26 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements included elsewhere in the Prospectusfor a description of the executive board compensation of Siemens AG that was attributable toSiemens Energy in the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Currently, the members of the Executive Board are also serving as managing directors of SEM
GmbH, which is the general partner of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, and are receiving the entiretyof their compensation under their employment contracts with SEM GmbH, with the exception ofMr. Tim Oliver Holt, who receives a portion of his compensation from Siemens Energy Inc. In thethree-month period ended June 30, 2020, the members of the Executive Board received a totalcash compensation of €5.5 million. Additionally, in the three-month period ended March 31,
2020, Dr.-Ing. Jochen Eickholt and Mr. Tim Oliver Holt received a total cash compensation of€0.3 million.
The members of the Executive Board have not been granted or received any compensation by
Siemens Energy AG. It is planned that Siemens Energy AG will assume responsibility forremunerating the members of the Executive Board shortly after Spin-Off. Once the members ofthe Executive Board will be compensated by Siemens Energy AG, they will no longer receiveremuneration for their position as managing directors of SEM GmbH. Pending the final approvalby the Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy AG after the Spin-Off, the remuneration system forExecutive Board members shall be structured as set out below:
17.2.3.1 Remuneration System
The remuneration system for the Executive Board supports the achievement of Siemens Energy’s
strategic goals and sets incentives for sustainable value creation while also discouraging excessiverisk-taking. The proposed target compensation structure for the Executive Board membersconsists of non-performance and performance-based components: approximately 30.0% basecompensation, 30.0% short-term variable compensation (“ Bonus ”) as well as 40.0% long-term
share-based compensation (“ Stock Awards ”). The remuneration system for the Executive Board
has the following components:
17.2.3.1.1 Non-Performance-Based Components
The members of the Executive Board receive a fixed base salary in cash which is paid in twelve
equal installments. The annual base salary for Dr.-Ing. Bruch is €1,440,000, for each of
Ms. Ferraro, Mr. Holt and Dr.-Ing. Eickholt it is €720,000.
Additionally, non-monetary benefits and perquisites (“ Fringe Benefits ”) are granted, such as
provision of a company car, contributions towards the cost of insurance, reimbursement of feesfor tax advice, accommodation and moving expenses (including any taxes that have beenassumed in this regard), as well as costs connected with preventive medical examinations. The
430
value of such Fringe Benefits must not exceed a specific maximum as determined prior to a given
fiscal year by the Supervisory Board in relation to the base salary.
17.2.3.1.2 Performance-Based Components
Performance-based components include a short-term incentive (Bonus) and a share-based long-
term incentive (Stock Awards):
Short-term incentive (Bonus). The Bonus rewards the contribution made in the previous fiscal
year to achieving Siemens Energy’s strategic goals. This contribution is measured by threeequally-weighted components: return on capital employed, Adjusted EBITA margin andindividual targets of either financial or non-financial nature. The level of target achievement foreach of the three components can vary between 0.0% and 150.0%. For a 100.0% targetattainment (target amount), the amount of the Bonus equals the amount of base compensation.The Bonus is paid out in cash. Despite the attainment of the set targets, the Supervisory Boardcan reduce the amount due under the Bonus (down to zero) or seek to recover pastcompensation already paid out in case of severe breaches of duty, severe violations of compliancerules and/or severe unethical behavior of a member of the Executive Board. The Bonus is cappedat the maximum possible level of target achievement, i.e., at 150.0%.
Share-based long-term incentive (Stock Awards). The Stock Awards reward a sustainable
development of Siemens Energy by measuring the achievement of financial and non-financialtargets over a four-year period. They are annual grants of forfeitable stock commitments madeto each Executive Board member at the beginning of a fiscal year. After a four-year vestingperiod, beneficiaries receive one share in the Company for each Stock Award or an equivalentamount in cash. The preliminary number of Stock Awards to be fulfilled after the vesting perioddepends on the Company’s performance during the vesting period as measured in threecomponents: total shareholder return relative to the STOXX Global 1800 Industrial Goods andServices (70.0%) and the MVIS US-Listed Oil Services 25 (30.0%), i.e., the change in price of a
Siemens Energy Share during the vesting period plus all dividends distributed during this period,compared with the shareholder return of the two indices (40.0%), Siemens Energy’s averageearnings per share compared with a pre-determined target (40.0%), and performance accordingto targets based on ESG factors (20.0%). The level of target achievement for each of the threecomponents can vary between 0.0% and 200.0%. Overall target achievement is the weightedaverage of the target achievement levels of the three components.
Each member of the Executive Board has a target amount for each annual Stock Awards tranche.
The annual target amount equals €1,920,000 for Dr.-Ing. Bruch, for each of Ms. Ferraro, Mr. Holt
and Dr.-Ing. Eickholt it is €960,000. This target amount is multiplied using the maximum possible
target achievement rate of 200.0% (“ Maximum Grant Amount ”). Stock Awards for this Maximum
Grant Amount are then granted to the beneficiary whereby the number of Stock Awards iscalculated by dividing the Maximum Grant Amount by the share price on the grant date, less thevalue of discounted dividends. Beneficiaries are not entitled to dividends during the vestingperiod. If the target achievement after the vesting period is less than 200.0%, the number ofStock Awards initially granted will be reduced accordingly, and the number of sharescorresponding to the reduced number of Stock Awards will be transferred. The value of SiemensEnergy AG shares to be transferred after the end of the vesting period is further limited to amaximum of 250.0% of the target amount. If this cap is exceeded, a corresponding number ofStock Awards will be forfeited without refund or replacement.
The long-term incentive does not allow for the Supervisory Board to make discretionary
adjustments to target achievement or pay-out levels except in exceptional circumstances ( e.g.,
severe economic crises). However, the Supervisory Board can reduce the amount due under thelong-term incentive (down to zero) or seek to recover past compensation already paid out in caseof severe breaches of duty, severe violations of compliance rules and/or severe unethical behaviorof the respective beneficiary.
431
17.2.3.1.3 Pension Benefit Commitments
The Supervisory Board decides annually whether to grant members of the Executive Board a
contribution to Siemens Energy’s pension plan. At its discretion, the Supervisory Board mayinstead elect to grant members an amount in cash (“pension substitute”). If pensioncontributions are made, these are credited to each Executive Board member’s personal pensionaccount. Executive Board members are eligible to receive benefits under the pension plan at theage of 62.
17.2.3.1.4 Maximum Amount of Total Compensation
In addition to the caps for Fringe Benefits, Bonus and Stock Awards, a maximum amount of total
compensation is agreed annually. The target compensation comprises the base salary, maximumFringe Benefits, target amounts for the Bonus and Stock Awards and pension contributions orpension substitutes (if any). If compensation exceeds this maximum, the respective amount inexcess of the maximum is forfeited without refund or replacement. For the fiscal year 2021, themaximum compensation amounts may be increased on a one-off basis by any Spin-Off incentive(see “ 17.2.3.4 Spin-Off Incentive in Connection with the Spin-Off ”).
17.2.3.2 Commitments in Connection with Termination of Executive Board Membership
The Executive Board contracts do not provide any possibility for ordinary termination with notice.
The mutual right to terminate the Executive Board contract without notice for cause remains ineffect. In the event of early termination of the appointment, the Executive Board contract is alsoterminated early unless the Supervisory Board adopts provisions to the contrary.
In the event of early termination of the Executive Board contract by mutual agreement, effective
with the Spin-Off Completion, the Executive Board contracts will stipulate a severance payment.It is intended that the amount of this payment be limited in line with the recommendations ofthe German Corporate Governance Code (severance cap), i.e., to two times annual compensation,
but not more than the value of the remaining term of the contract.
No severance payments or special pension contributions will be made in case of an early
termination at the request of the Executive Board member or termination for cause by theCompany.
There are to be no special provisions for members of the Executive Board in the event that a
change of control occurs, that is neither special rights to terminate the contract nor severancepayments.
17.2.3.3 D&O Insurance
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board members and certain employees of the Siemens
Group are currently covered by a group liability insurance policy with regard to theirmanagement activities. This policy which is concluded for one-year terms at a time coverspersonal liability for financial loss associated with performing the respective activity. The policyprovides for a deductible/retention that conforms to the requirements of the German StockCorporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ). Siemens Energy intends to provide a similar insurance coverage
under a Siemens Energy group liability insurance policy upon the Spin-Off Completion.
17.2.3.4 Spin-Off Incentive in Connection with the Spin-Off
Prior to Spin-Off Completion, the Executive Board members were granted a Spin-Off incentive,
i.e., a transaction bonus, by SEM GmbH. Accordingly, amounts ranging from 100% to 200% of a
target amount individually determined for each Executive Board member will be paid out subjectto the target being achieved. The target amount is €1,500,000 for Dr.-Ing. Christian Bruch and
€750,000 each for Dr.-Ing. Jochen Eickholt, Maria Ferraro and Tim Oliver Holt. The target
amount will be paid out if two conditions are met. The first condition must be met as of Spin-OffCompletion. It is fulfilled if the value of Siemens Energy for determining the financial result ofthe Spin-Off as determined by an independent company valuation (the “ Market Value ”)
432
exceeds Siemens Energy’s book value as determined under IFRS by a certain threshold amount.
Any amounts exceeding this threshold amount are subtracted from the Market Value todetermine, the “ Adjusted Market Value ”. The second condition is met if the Company’s stock
market value as determined on the basis of the average volume-weighted price of the Sharesduring the first 120 calendar days after Listing reaches or exceeds the Adjusted Market Value. Ifthese target values are not achieved, no Spin-Off incentive will be paid out. If the target valuesare exceeded, a maximum of up to 200% of the target amount will be paid out. Values between100% and 200% are determined by linear interpolation. The Executive Board members areobliged to reinvest the net profits from the Spin-Off incentive in Shares of the Company. It isintended that the obligation to settle the Spin-Off incentive will be assumed by Siemens EnergyAG after Spin-Off Completion.
17.2.3.5 Treatment of Siemens Entitlements after the Spin-Off Completion
Siemens AG and its group companies have granted or will grant prior to the Spin-Off Completion
under the share plans of Siemens Group various entitlements to shares of no par value(registered shares) in Siemens AG to members of the Executive Board and employees of SiemensAG as well as to members of corporate bodies and employees of Siemens Group companies,including members of corporate bodies and employees of the Siemens Energy Group (the“Beneficiaries ”) in the context of share-based compensation programs and employee
participation programs, respectively (together the “ Stock Entitlements ”).
The Stock Entitlements of Beneficiaries of the Siemens Energy Group who leave the Siemens
Group as a direct consequence of the Spin-Off Completion (because either their employingcompany is no longer part of the Siemens Group or their contract provides for a termination as aresult of the Spin-Off) will be forfeited in accordance with the rules of the respective share plan.However, these Beneficiaries are entitled to cash compensation, upon the Spin-Off Completionfor the Stock Entitlements from that entity of the Siemens Group or the Siemens Energy Groupwhich is bound by the Stock Entitlement. As of August 26, 2020, we expect that the net cashoutflow for the cash compensation to be paid by Siemens Energy Group will amount toapproximately €229 million.
17.2.4 Shareholdings of Executive Board Members and Share Ownership Obligation
The members of the Executive Board do not, apart from Siemens AG shares, directly or indirectly,
hold any Shares or options on Shares of the Company as of the date of the Prospectus. Themembers of the Executive Board in total hold 27,546 shares in Siemens AG for which 13,772shares in Siemens Energy AG will be issued upon Spin-Off Completion.
Subject to formal approval of the Executive Board members’ compensation by the Supervisory
Board following Spin-Off Completion, under the Siemens Energy Share Ownership Guidelines,the Executive Board members shall be obligated to continually hold Siemens Energy AG shares ofan amount equal to a multiple of their base salary – 300.0% for the CEO and 200.0% for theother members of the Executive Board – during their term of office. An initial approximatelyfour-year build-up phase beginning with the trading of the Shares on the Frankfurt StockExchange allows Executive Board members to acquire the necessary shares over time.

17.3 Supervisory Board
17.3.1 General
Currently the Supervisory Board consists of three shareholder representatives. Upon Spin-Off
Completion, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Companyand the Company will therefore become subject to the German Co-Determination Act(Mitbestimmungsgesetz ). In accordance with Sections 95 and 96 of the German Stock Corporation
Act ( Aktiengesetz ) and Section 7 of the German Co-Determination Act ( Mitbestimmungsgesetz ),
the Supervisory Board will in future consist of twenty members (ten shareholder representativesand ten employee representatives). The shareholder representatives are elected by theshareholders at the general shareholders’ meeting. The new composition of the SupervisoryBoard must be determined in a formal procedure, so-called “status proceedings”(Statusverfahren ), that will be initiated by the Executive Board of Siemens Energy AG
immediately after the Spin-Off Completion.
The shareholders’ meeting of Siemens Energy AG on August 20, 2020 has amended the Articles of
Association regarding the Supervisory Board so that the Supervisory Board consists of tenmembers (“ First Amendment of the Articles of Association ”). The First Amendment of the
Articles of Association was registered with the commercial register on September 1, 2020.Furthermore, in anticipation of the Spin-Off Completion, the shareholders’ meeting of SiemensEnergy AG on August 20, 2020 has amended the Articles of Association regarding the SupervisoryBoard so that the Supervisory Board will in the future consist of twenty members (tenshareholder representatives and ten employee representatives) (“ Second Amendment of the
Articles of Association ”). The Second Amendment of the Articles of Association is subject to the
provision that it will be registered with the commercial register in such manner as to ensure thatit only becomes effective upon the Spin-Off Completion and completion of the statusproceedings. The current and future composition of the Supervisory Board is as follows:
 The three current members of the Supervisory Board will resign upon the Spin-Off Completion. The general shareholders’ meeting has already elected ten new members of the Supervisory
Board. The election is conditional on the Spin-Off Completion. The term of office of thesemembers of the Supervisory Board will end upon the registration of the Second Amendment ofthe Articles of Association described above. However, under a corresponding conditionprecedent, they have also been elected for another term of office beginning with theregistration of the Second Amendment of the Articles of Association until the end of thegeneral shareholders’ meeting that resolves on the discharge for the fiscal year endingSeptember 30, 2020 (“ AGM 2021 ”).
 After completion of the status proceedings, the Company plans to have employee
representatives be appointed by the competent court (the “ Court Appointment ”) until such a
time as regular employee representatives can be elected in accordance with the provisions ofthe German Co-Determination Act ( Mitbestimmungsgesetz ) (the “ Employee Election ”).
The Supervisory Board members that are shareholder representatives are elected by the
shareholders in the Company’s general shareholders’ meeting. Unless the general shareholders’meeting has set a shorter term, the term of each Supervisory Board member, as well as the termof each substitute member, expires at the end of the annual general shareholders’ meetingratifying the activities of the Supervisory Board for the fourth fiscal year following thecommencement of the member’s term of office, not including the fiscal year in which the termcommences. The election of a successor for a member leaving his or her office before the end ofhis or her term of office is valid for the remainder of the term of office of the departing member.Re-election is possible.
The Articles of Association provide that Supervisory Board members and substitute members of
the Supervisory Board may resign, without good cause on one month’s notice, by providingwritten notice to the Supervisory Board chair. The shareholders’ meeting may appoint substitutemembers for one or more Supervisory Board members, who, in accordance with the orderdetermined by election, may become members of the Supervisory Board if elected shareholder
434
representatives leave office before the end of their term or if the election has been set aside by a
court. The term of the substitute member expires as soon as a successor for the departingSupervisory Board member is appointed but no later than the expiration of the departingSupervisory Board member’s term.
At least one member of the supervisory board of a publicly traded company must have expertise
in the field of accounting or auditing. It must be ensured that at least one member of theSupervisory Board has this required financial expertise. Under mandatory statutory provisions andthe Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board is authorized to establish internal rules ofprocedure ( Geschäftsordnung ). The Supervisory Board’s will adopt internal rules of procedure
after the Spin-Off.
Following completion of the status proceedings described above and appointment of the
employee representatives to the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board will elect a new chairand deputy chair from among its members. The election of the chair and first deputy chair will,pursuant to Section 27 of the German Co-Determination Act ( Mitbestimmungsgesetz ), in the
future require a two-thirds majority vote. If either the chair or first deputy chair is not elected bya vote of two-thirds of the members of the Supervisory Board, the shareholder representativeswill elect the chair and the employee representatives will elect the first deputy chair by a simplemajority of the votes cast. The Supervisory Board may elect one or more other deputy chairs bysimple majority vote. The Supervisory Board is authorized to make amendments to the Articles ofAssociation that only affect their wording. Meetings of the Supervisory Board are called by itschair or, if he is unavailable, by a deputy chair, giving at least 14 days’ advance notice (notincluding the day on which the invitation is sent and the day of the meeting itself). In urgentcases the chair can shorten the notice period. The chair may call a meeting in writing, orally, byphone, telefax, e-mail or any other common means of communication. Pursuant to the Articles ofAssociation that enter into force upon the Spin-Off Completion and completion of the statusproceedings, at least half of the members of which the Supervisory Board is required to comprisemust participate in voting on a resolution to constitute a quorum. For calculating the quorum,any member who is present but abstains from voting is deemed to have participated in the vote.Unless otherwise required by law or by the Articles of Association, resolutions of the SupervisoryBoard are passed by a simple majority of the votes cast. For purposes of passing a resolution,abstentions do not count as votes cast. If a vote of the Supervisory Board results in a tie, thenpursuant to the Articles of Association that enter into force upon the Spin-Off Completion andcompletion of the status proceedings, the chair’s vote counts twice if a second vote on the samemotion also results in a tie. The Articles of Association provide that if all members participate orif adequate prior notice is given, then without a meeting and on the chair’s instructionresolutions may be passed in writing, orally, by phone, telefax or e-mail or any other commonmeans of communication or any combination thereof.

Pursuant to Section 12 of the new version of the Articles of Association that will come into force
upon the Spin-Off Completion and completion of the status proceedings, the members of theSupervisory Board of Siemens Energy AG will receive a fixed annual compensation as follows: thebase compensation will be €240,000 for the chair of the Supervisory Board, €180,000 for each

Board members under which a Supervisory Board member would receive benefits from theCompany or its subsidiaries on termination of his or her service as Supervisory Board member.Any envisaged D&O liability insurance that provides coverage for liability claims arising out oftheir activities as members of the corporate bodies shall also cover the members of theSupervisory Board of Siemens Energy AG.
17.3.5 Shareholdings of Supervisory Board Members
None of the above-mentioned current and future members of the Supervisory Board hold any
Shares or options on Shares of the Company as of the date of the Prospectus. See“15 Shareholder Structure ”. However, individual members of the Supervisory Board hold 252,692
Siemens AG shares in total, for which 126,341 Shares in Siemens Energy AG will be issued uponthe Spin-Off Completion, if the shares are still held on such date.
17.4 Certain Information on the Members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory
Board
During the last five years, no current member of the Executive Board or current or future
member of the Supervisory Board (see “ 17.3.2 Current and Future Members of the Supervisory
Board ”) has been convicted of any fraudulent offenses. In addition, in the last five years, no
official public incriminations and/or sanctions have been pending or imposed by statutory orregulatory authorities (including professional associations) against a current member of theExecutive Board or current or future member of the Supervisory Board. With the exception ofMr. Zwirn, who acted as non-executive director at SunEdison, Inc. whilst it reorganized underChapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code beginning in 2016, no current member of the ExecutiveBoard or current or future member of the Supervisory Board, acting in the capacity of a memberof a management or supervisory entity or as senior manager, has been associated with anybankruptcies and/or insolvencies, receiverships or liquidations. No current member of theExecutive Board or current or future member of the Supervisory Board has ever been deemed bya court to be unfit for membership in a management or supervisory entity of a company or to beunfit to exercise management duties for or manage the business of an issuer during the past five
448
years. At the date of this Prospectus, no family relationships exist among the members of the
Executive Board, among the members of the Supervisory Board or among the members of theExecutive Board on the one hand and the members of the Supervisory Board on the other hand.
All current and six future members of the Supervisory Board are at the same time affiliated with
Siemens AG, either because they are members of the executive board or the supervisory board ofSiemens AG or employees of Siemens, which after the Spin-Off Completion will initially hold aninterest of 35.1% in Siemens Energy AG. The interests of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AGmay not always be aligned. This is a potential conflict of interest for the current members of theSupervisory Board as well as for Mr. Joe Kaeser, Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas, Mr. Matthias E.Rebellius, Dr. Andrea Fehrmann, Mr. Jürgen Kerner and Mr. Hagen Reimer in respect of theirduty as members of the Supervisory Board to act in the best interests of the Company. However,it should be noted that Supervisory Board members may not act in their own interests or in theinterests of persons or companies with whom they have a close relationship if those interestsconflict with those of the company or serves to attract business opportunities to such memberswhat would otherwise have gone to the company. Apart from that, there are no conflicts ofinterest or potential conflicts of interests between the duties of members of the Executive Boardand duties of members of the Supervisory Board vis-à-vis Siemens Energy AG and their private
interests or other obligations.
Beyond the service agreements of the members of the Executive Board, there are no further
service or employment agreements between the Company, its subsidiaries, and any of itsExecutive Board members under which an Executive Board member would receive benefits fromthe Company or its subsidiaries on termination of his or her service as board member.
17.5 Corporate Governance
The German Corporate Governance Code ( Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex ) (the
“DCGK ”), in its most recent version of December 16, 2019 and as published in the German
Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ) on March 20, 2020, includes recommendations and suggestions
for managing and supervising companies listed on German stock exchanges. It is based oninternationally and nationally recognized standards of good, responsible corporate management.The DCGK contains recommendations (“shall provisions”) and suggestions (“should provisions”)for corporate governance in relation to shareholders and the shareholders’ meeting, theexecutive board and the supervisory board, transparency and accounting as well as auditing offinancial statements. While compliance with the recommendations or suggestions of the DCGK isnot mandatory, the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ) requires the management and
supervisory boards of a listed company to disclose each year which recommendations were andwill be complied with and which recommendations were not or will not be applied and why(so-called “declaration of conformity”). Deviations from the suggestions contained in the DCGKneed not be disclosed. The declaration of conformity must be made publicly available on theCompany’s website at all times.
Prior to the listing of the Shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Company is not subject to
the obligation to render a declaration as to compliance with the DCGK. As of the date of thisProspectus, the Company – as a corporation whose shares are not yet listed – does not complywith the recommendations of the DCGK.
The Company will fully meet the obligation as a listed company to submit, publish and provide
shareholders with permanent access to disclosure in accordance with Section 161 of the GermanStock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ) during the course of the current fiscal year. The Executive
Board and Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy AG believe in the objectives of the DCGK tofoster a responsible and transparent corporate management and control directed towardsachieving a sustained increase in shareholder value.
The Company intends to comply after the listing of the Shares with all recommendations in the
DCGK, except for the following:
 Item C.5: According to the DCGK’s recommendation, members of the management board of a
listed company shall not have, in aggregate, more than two supervisory board mandates in
449
non-group listed companies or comparable functions, and shall not accept the chairmanship of
a supervisory board in a non-group listed company. It is envisaged that our designatedchairman of the Supervisory Board will continue to be a member of the executive board ofSiemens AG until February 2021. During this time period, the chair of the Supervisory Boardwill (i) hold more than two supervisory board mandates and (ii) be a chairman of a supervisoryboard whilst being a member of the management board of another listed company.
 Item C.10, sentence 1 of the DCGK and Item D.4, sentence 1 of the DCGK: According to the
DCGK’s recommendation, the chair of the supervisory board and of the audit committee shallbe independent. The chair of the Supervisory Board and the chair of the Supervisory Board’saudit committee may not fulfill, subject to final assessment by the Supervisory Board, therequirement of independence as they are associated with our shareholder Siemens AG.

17.6.1 Gas and Power Employees
During the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 and the fiscal year 2019, our Gas and Power
segment had an average number of employees (based on headcount) of 66 and 65 thousand.
In the fiscal year 2019, the average number of employees (based on headcount) per division was
20 thousand in Transmission, 27 thousand in Generation and 17 thousand in IndustrialApplications. The related total average number of employees (based on headcount) in serviceamounted to 21 thousand. This comprises employees from the service businesses from thedivisions Transmission, Generation and Industrial Application as well as Digitalization.
Our Gas and Power segment has in the past implemented several restructuring plans that led to
headcount reductions, see “ 9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special
Items ”.
17.6.1.1 Gas and Power Labor Relations
Some Gas and Power employees are organized in country-specific union organizations. In
Germany, Gas and Power employees are organized in the German Metalworker’s Union(Industriegewerkschaft Metall ). We are a member of various regional employers’ associations.
Members of these organizations are subject to the respective collective bargaining agreements.
In certain cases, our employees are represented by employee representatives on the boards of
our Group companies. In particular, following the Spin-Off, 50% of the members of theSupervisory Board will be employee representatives.
Our German Gas and Power employees are also represented by works councils. Pursuant to the
German Works Constitution Act ( Betriebsverfassungsgesetz ), works councils have numerous
rights relating to the notification and co-determination in personnel, social and economicmatters. For instance, works councils are required to be notified in advance of any dismissal of anemployee, must confirm hiring and relocations of employees. Co-determination rights in socialmatters are for example related to the establishment of work schedules and rules of conduct.
Our German Gas and Power senior managers are represented by the company spokespersons’
councils ( Sprecherausschüsse für leitende Angestellte ). They have numerous notification and
consultation rights regarding personnel and economic matters.
If a European works council is established after the Spin-Off, our employees in member states of
the European Union and other contracting states to the agreement on the European EconomicArea are represented by it. The European works council has information and consultation rightsregarding cross-border matters with impact on employees.
Good relationships with our employees are especially important to us and we believe that our
employee relations are positive.
17.6.1.2 Gas and Power Employee Stock Participation Plans
Until Spin-Off Completion, many of our Gas and Power employees have been or will be granted
entitlements to Siemens shares under various Siemens employee programs. Following Spin-OffCompletion, our employees are no longer eligible to participate in Siemens employee programs.Any outstanding entitlements under these programs will then be compensated in cash (see“17.2.3.5 Treatment of Siemens Entitlements after the Spin-Off Completion ”).
Siemens Energy intends to implement employee share programs (to be settled in Shares or in
cash) for the Gas and Power employees in certain jurisdictions during the course of the fiscal yearending September 30, 2021. Those share programs are intended to give employees (includingmanagers) the opportunity to participate sustainably in the Group’s success. Accordingly, SiemensEnergy plans to implement a matching program (see “ 17.6.1.2.1 Matching program ”), stock
awards (see “ 17.6.1.2.2 Stock awards ”) and a jubilee share program (see “ 17.6.1.2.3 Jubilee share
program ”). Additionally, managers and employees may participate in one-time Spin-Off incentive
programs (see “ 17.6.1.2.4 Employee Spin-Off incentive ”).
451
17.6.1.2.1 Matching program
Under the matching program, eligible employees (including managers but excluding members of
the Executive Board) of Siemens Energy can invest up to five percent of their annual (gross) totaltarget cash compensation in shares of the Company. For each three shares so acquired (the“Investment Shares ”), the employee receives one matching share in the Company (“ Matching
Share ”) or, in exceptional cases, an equivalent payment in cash. As a general rule, the Investment
Shares and Matching Shares will be subject to a mandatory blocking period of one year.Employees of a Group company located in Germany may take advantage of tax benefitsapplicable to employee share investments of up to €360 per annum. In these cases, participants
may choose to invest €100 or €260. When investing €100, participants receive two Matching
Shares per Investment Share that is acquired using that investment amount; for a furtherinvestment amount of €160, they receive one Matching Share per share that is acquired using
the further investment amount. Shares so acquired will not be subject to a blocking period. Theseinvestment amounts will count against the five percent threshold of the annual (gross) totaltarget cash amount mentioned above. For investment amounts exceeding €260, the general
rules detailed above apply.
17.6.1.2.2 Stock awards
Employees holding upper management level positions will receive forfeitable performance-
oriented stock commitments. The terms and conditions of these commitments are largelyidentical with the stock awards granted to members of the Executive Board (see“17.2.3.1.2 Performance-Based Components ”). Other employees of senior management and
further selected employees may receive non-performance-oriented stock awards. These stockawards follow a ratable vesting scheme, i.e., each year the employee receives a number of shares
in the Company corresponding to 25% of the initially granted number of stock awards or, inexceptional cases, an equivalent payment in cash. Additionally, stock awards following thedescribed ratable vesting scheme can be granted to employees to honor outstandingperformance.
17.6.1.2.3 Jubilee share program
A jubilee share program is intended to be implemented for employees in Germany which
provides that eligible employees will receive jubilee shares for their 10th, 25th, 40th and 50thservice anniversary.
17.6.1.2.4 Employee Spin-Off incentive and Share Buy Back Programs
(1) Building Siemens Energy Incentive ProgramUnder the Building Siemens Energy Incentive Program a low triple digit number of key
employees who contributed essentially to the preparation of the Spin-Off were granted aone-time spin-off incentive. The initial value of the incentive consists of a percentage of thebeneficiary’s base salary at the grant date (“ BSEI Target Amount ”). It consists of two elements: a
short-term cash component that corresponds to 25% of the BSEI Target Amount and will be paidfollowing Spin-Off Completion and a long-term equity component which corresponds to 75% ofthe BSEI Target Amount and is composed of forfeitable stock awards (“ BSEI Stock Awards ”). The
number of BSEI Stock Awards will be determined by dividing 75% of the BSEI Target Amount bythe volume-weighted average price (“ VWAP ”) of the Shares during the first 120 trading days of
after the Listing. Each BSEI Stock Award entitles the holder to one share in the Company or, inexceptional cases, an equivalent payment in cash. The BSEI Stock Awards will be settled after avesting period of three years starting with Spin-Off Completion. The settlement of the BSEI StockAwards is subject to the development of the Share price during the first three years following theListing. The number of BSEI Stock Awards settled can range from a minimum of 33% to amaximum of 300%. The minimum number of Stock Awards will be settled if the VWAP of theShares during the last 60 trading days of the vesting period is lower than the VWAP during thefirst 120 trading days after the Listing. The maximum number of Stock Awards will be
452
settled if the price of the Shares has at least doubled whereas a value cap of 4.75 times the BSEI
Target Amount applies. The maximum contribution to the employees under this program isexpected to amount to approximately €100 million.
(2) All Employee Program, German All Employee Program and 2020 Special Payment
In certain jurisdictions, similar employee Spin-Off incentive programs will be set up that provide
for stock awards on substantially the same terms, but without a short-term cash component (the“All Employee Program ”). The individual target amount is defined as 3% of the annual (gross)
total target cash compensation of each participant as of September 1, 2020 (“ All Employee
Program Target Amount ”). The number of shares transferred to each participant is subject to the
share price development over a time frame of three years after the Listing. The number of Sharestransferred can range from a minimum of 100% to a maximum of 300%. The minimum numberof Shares will be transferred if the VWAP of the Shares during the last 60 trading days prior toSeptember 25, 2023 is lower than the VWAP during the first 120 trading days after the Listing.The maximum number of Shares will be settled if the price of the Shares has at least doubledwhereas a value cap of 6.0 times the All Employee Program Target Amount applies. Themaximum contribution to the employees under this program is expected to amount toapproximately €680 million.
Under the “ German All Employee Program ”, the number of Shares transferrable to the
participants at the end of the vesting period ranges from 100% to a maximum of 200%. 100% ofShares will be transferred if the VWAP of the Shares during the last 60 trading days prior toSeptember 25, 2023 is equal to or exceeds 150% of the VWAP during the first 120 trading daysafter the Listing, while the maximum 200% of Shares will be settled if the price of the Shares hasat least doubled. A value cap of 4.0 times the All Employee Program Target Amount applies.
Additionally, employees of the participating German Group companies may also participate in a
separate share program (“ 2020 Special Payment ”). The program allows these employees to
benefit from certain tax rules recently introduced by the German legislator with a view tomitigating COVID-19-related detriments. Participants of the 2020 Special Payment will receiveShares representing a value of 2.6% of their total target cash compensation as of September 1,2020) but at least €1,000 on November 26, 2020.
(3) Share Buy Back Program
Siemens Energy AG will implement a program to repurchase its own Shares immediately after
occurrence of the Listing. The repurchase program is expected to run from September 28, 2020until March 31, 2021 at the latest. During this period, Shares shall be repurchased for up to€393 million, but not more than 72,664,519 Shares. The repurchase program will serve to
distribute Shares to members of the Executive Board and employees of the Siemens EnergyGroup (see, for example, “ 17.2.3.1.2 Performance-Based Components ” and “ 17.6.1.2.4 Employee
Spin-Off incentive ”). The repurchase of Shares can be stopped, interrupted and continued at any
time in accordance with applicable legal requirements. The purchase price per Share paid on thestock exchange (excluding ancillary acquisition costs) may not be more than 10% higher or 20%lower than the price of a Share determined on the relevant trading day by the opening auctionin Xetra trading (or in a comparable successor system). Depending on prevailing trading volumesand subject to applicable trading conditions, Siemens Energy AG intends to repurchase asubstantial part of the volume at the beginning of the repurchase period.
17.6.2 SGRE Employees
17.6.2.1 SGRE Headcount
During the nine-month period ended June 30, 2020 and the fiscal year 2019, our SGRE segment
had an average number of employees (based on headcount) of 25 and 24 thousand, respectively.
Our SGRE segment has in the past implemented several restructuring plans that led to headcount
reductions, see “ 9.4.10 Integration and Operational Improvement Measures; Special Items ”.
453
On the other hand, the acquisition of selected European assets of Senvion (see
“12.9.3 Acquisition of Selected European Assets of Senvion ”) included the onboarding of close to
2,000 of Senvion’s former employees.
17.6.2.2 SGRE Labor Relations
Labor relations between SGRE and its employees are regulated by the legal regulations of each
country and such agreements and arrangements as may have been reached with employees’representatives. At international level and due to its European footprint, SGRE is currently stillpart of the Siemens AG European Works Council, where it is playing an active role in providingemployees with information and consultation rights. Within that framework it has agreed withits employees’ representatives to establish a specific working group aimed at establishing a closerand more flexible space for social dialogue. SGRE has a working group for the communicationand discussion of labor-related topics affecting more than one European country; this workinggroup will continue to be in existence within SGRE after the separation from Siemens, butindependently from the Siemens AG European Works Council.
Since November 2019, a renewed and upgraded Global Framework Agreement between SGRE, its
labor representatives and IndustriALL Global Union (the “ GFA”) is in place. IndustriALL is the
global trade union with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, that encompasses Gamesa’s (andnow SGRE’s) industrial activity. SGRE believes that the new GFA is still the only global agreementof its kind to guarantee labor rights by a company in the renewable energy sector. The GFAAgreement applies to all companies in the SGRE group (including any potential new group entityresulting after a merger, acquisition or restructuring) and to all its employees worldwide duringthe fulfillment of their functions and in their work, commercial and professional relationships. Itcontains provisions that strengthen the rights of workers and trade unions, strengthens social,labor and environmental rights already contained in SGRE’s Business Conduct Guidelines issued in2018 (including the employees’ rights to freedom of association, union membership andcollective bargaining), makes health and safety at work, working conditions and equalopportunities key issues for company action, and guarantees implementation and promotes theconditions for a social dialogue at the international level. The GFA will be valid for four yearsfrom the date of signature. At the request of either party, negotiations to revise the GFA may beagreed. During the year preceding the end of the GFA’s term, and no later than six months priorto such date, the management of SGRE, the IndustriALL Global Union and the representativeunion organizations will meet to examine whether the GFA shall be renewed or not.
SGRE is a member of the UN Global Compact, so that its ten Principles and the Global Industrial
Union Framework Agreement are binding for SGRE. This means that all of SGRE’s employees areactively covered by a legally binding and freely negotiated collective agreement.
At a national level, the situation varies due to the large number of countries and practical
differences among them. Roughly half of SGRE’s employees were covered by collectivebargaining agreements at a local level as of the end of the fiscal year 2019.
17.6.2.3 SGRE Incentive and Benefit Plans
In addition to the fix remuneration, SGRE has defined a globally applicable short-term incentive
program for about 30% of its total staff. The target structure for this program is composed of70% overall SGRE performance indicators and 30% individual targets.
SGRE has a long-term incentive plan (the “ Long-Term Incentive Plan ” or the “ Plan”) in place,
originally approved by SGRE’s general shareholders’ meeting on March 23, 2018, whichcontemplates the delivery of shares of the SGRE S.A. linked to the achievement of certainstrategic objectives after measurement periods of three years. This Long-Term Incentive Plan isaddressed to a maximum of 300 beneficiaries, including the Chief Executive Officer, seniorexecutives, certain directors and employees of SGRE S.A. and, where appropriate, of subsidiariesof the SGRE group. The Plan has a total duration of five years divided into three independentcycles with a measurement period of three years for each cycle ( i.e., 2018-2020, 2019-2021 and
2020-2022). The settlement period of the Plan will fall during the fiscal years 2021 for the first
454
cycle, 2022 for the second cycle and 2023 for the third cycle. The shares will be delivered within
sixty calendar days from the date on which SGRE S.A.’s board of directors prepares the financialstatements for the relevant period, in order to determine the degree of achievement of theobjectives for each cycle (“ Delivery Date ”). The Plan will end on the Delivery Date for the cycle
relating to the first cycle ( i.e., following the preparation of the financial statements for the fiscal
year ending September 30, 2022). The designation of an individual as a beneficiary of a Plan cyclewill not necessarily entitle participation in other Plan cycles. The Plan was amended pursuant to aresolution of SGRE S.A.’s general shareholders’ meeting held on March 27, 2019; the amendmentsapply for the second and third cycles of the Plan. The number of employees entitled to the plan’sfirst cycle is 174, for the second cycle 191 and 183 for the third cycle. The Plan (as amended) maynot exceed, in total, the delivery of 7,560,000 shares. SGRE S.A. will allocate treasury shares tocover the Plan or otherwise meet the commitments derived from the Plan with a financialinstrument that provides adequate coverage.
Furthermore, certain SGRE employees that have transferred from other Siemens Group entities
participate in share-based payment awards implemented by Siemens. In such cases, Siemensdelivers the respective shares on behalf of SGRE. Due to the limited extent of participation inthese share-based programs, the effect on SGRE’s consolidated financial statements for the pastthree fiscal years is not significant. Any outstanding entitlements under these programs will besettled in cash after the Spin-Off Completion (see “ 17.2.3.5 Treatment of Siemens Entitlements
after the Spin-Off Completion ”).
Moreover, SGRE offers benefits which differ on a local basis and are dependent on each country’s
regulations and general market practices. Such benefits may include post-employment benefits(pension plans), health, life and disability insurance and others.
SGRE provides post-employment defined benefit plans to almost all of its employees in Germany.
Outside Germany, predominantly service gratuities and severance indemnities pursuant to legalrequirements or arrangements applicable to the industry are provided by a limited number ofSGRE entities in different jurisdictions. SGRE’s major plans are funded with assets in specificentities. In accordance with local laws and bilateral agreements with benefit trusts (trustagreements), those plans are managed in the interest of the beneficiaries. SGRE’s defined benefitplans cover about 6,000 participants for the fiscal year 2019 (2,800 and 3,000 participants for thefiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively), which almost only comprises active employees.
In Germany, SGRE provides pension benefits through the plan SGRE “ Beitragsorientierte Siemens
Altersversorgung ” (hereinafter, “ SGRE BSAV ”), frozen legacy plans and deferred compensation
plans. The majority of SGRE’s active employees in Germany participate in the SGRE BSAV. Thosebenefits are predominantly based on contributions made by SGRE and returns earned on suchcontributions, subject to a minimum return guaranteed by SGRE. The frozen plans expose theemployer to investment risk, interest rate risk and longevity risk. The effects of compensationincreases are substantially eliminated. The pension plans are funded via contractual trustarrangements. No legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply. SGRE expects to payemployer contributions to the German defined benefit plans in the fiscal year 2020 in theamount of approximately €4 million. The pension obligations of SGRE vis-à-vis the SGRE BSAV
participants shall remain unaffected by the Spin-Off.
SGRE also intends to implement two different share plans: an Employee Share Plan and a Share-
Based Recognition Program. Under the Employee Share Plan, an investment will be rewardedwith free SGRE S.A. shares (for every three shares acquired, one free share will be granted after atwo-year holding period). The Employee Share Plan is currently expected to be implemented bySGRE in November 2020 in selected countries, with no specific limitation on the number ofparticipants. The annual cost to SGRE relating to SGRE’s investment for the Employee Share Planmay not exceed €4 million in the aggregate (reflecting a maximum employee investment
totaling €12 million). The Share-Based Recognition Program aims at rewarding outstanding
performance by granting beneficiaries recognition stock awards which will be converted into freeSGRE S.A. shares after two years. According to the current plan, the Share-Based RecognitionProgram could be implemented in September 2020 (with the recognition stock awards under the
455
plan being granted in October 2020). It is currently envisaged that SGRE S.A. will nominate an
estimated number of 100 employees for the Share-Based Recognition Plan, and the selectioncriteria is expected to be based on SGRE’s corporate values. The number of recognition stockawards to be granted to each beneficiary is expected to range from a minimum of 5% to amaximum of 35% of the annual base salary. According to the current plan, the Share-BasedRecognition Program will have a duration of two years from the moment of granting therecognition stock awards until the moment when they will be converted into SGRE S.A. shares.The annual cost of the stock awards granted cannot exceed €1 million per year. Both share plans
would need annual SGRE Board of Directors’ approval to be implemented in the subsequent year.

18 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED-PARTY
TRANSACTIONS
In accordance with IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”, transactions with persons or companies
which are, inter alia , members of the same group as a company or which are in control of, or
controlled by a company must be disclosed unless they are already included as consolidatedcompanies in a company’s financial statements. Control exists if a shareholder owns more thanone half of the voting rights in a company or, by virtue of an agreement, has the power tocontrol the financial and operating policies of a company’s management. The disclosurerequirements under IAS 24 also extend to transactions with associated companies (including jointventures) as well as transactions with persons who have significant influence on a company’sfinancial and operating policies, including close family members and intermediate entities. Thisincludes members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and close members of theirfamilies, as well as those entities over which the members of the Executive Board and SupervisoryBoard or their close family members are able to exercise a significant influence or in which theyhold a significant share of the voting rights.
Set forth below is a summary of such transactions of Siemens Energy with related parties for the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 as well as for the current fiscal year 2020up to the date of this Prospectus. Further information, including quantitative amounts, of relatedparty transactions are contained in Note 26 to our Audited Combined Financial Statements andNote 10 to our Unaudited Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements, which are includedin “21 Financial Information ” of this Prospectus on page F-2 et seq. Business relationships
between companies of the Siemens Energy Group are not included.
18.1 Transactions and Relationships with the Siemens Group
Prior to the Spin-Off Completion, Siemens Energy AG is a wholly-owned directly and indirectlyheld subsidiary of Siemens AG. By and large, Siemens Energy AG has not conducted and will notconduct its own business or operations prior to the Spin-Off Completion, which is why thefollowing discussion focuses on SE Global GmbH & Co. KG and its subsidiaries. Until the Spin-OffCompletion, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG also remains a subsidiary of Siemens AG.
As part of the Siemens Group, the Group’s companies had various business relationships with
other companies of the Siemens Group in the past and will continue to have significantrelationships with the Siemens Group following the Spin-Off Completion.
18.1.1 Ongoing Relationships with the Siemens Group
18.1.1.1 Relationships with and Services Provided by the Siemens Group to Siemens Energy
Before the Spin-Off, the Siemens Group and Siemens Energy entered into various agreements, in
limited cases also concerning or involving SGRE as a party, mainly covering general administrativeand specific technical matters, services and treasury matters provided by Siemens, in particularrelating to guarantees, sureties, standby letters of credit and other securities (together“Securities ”), financing, letters of credit, hedges, procurement, supply, IP rights, real estate,
general administration, IT and technical support, including cybersecurity, R&D as well as the“internet of things”. Siemens AG and Siemens Energy strive to maintain a strong partnership, inparticular for the first quarters after Spin-Off Completion, with numerous agreements in placegoverning their ongoing relationship, in particular:
18.1.1.1.1 Agreements in relation to the Carve-Out and the Spin-Off
(1) Master Separation AgreementOn March 31, 2020, Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG concluded a framework
agreement (the “ Master Separation Agreement ”) to address certain consequences arising from
the Carve-Out. Pursuant to the Master Separation Agreement, Siemens AG and SE GlobalGmbH & Co. KG are each jointly and severally liable for the obligations of their respective
457
subsidiaries under the Carve-Out-related agreements. Consequently, Siemens AG and SE Global
GmbH & Co KG are, amongst others, liable for the respective indemnity obligations agreed uponunder the local asset transfer agreements (“ LATAs ”).
Furthermore, Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG have agreed to indemnify Siemens
Energy and Siemens, respectively, from and against any losses, liabilities, damages, costs andexpenses arising out of or in connection with the businesses allocated to Siemens or SiemensEnergy as part of the Carve-Out if no other specific rule under the respective local asset transferagreement applies stipulating a different allocation of losses, liabilities, damages, costs andexpenses, provided that the respective joint and several liability of Siemens AG and SE GlobalGmbH & Co. KG under the Carve-Out-related agreements as described above remains unaffected.For the assertion of indemnification claims, a mechanism for the pooling of claims wasestablished at the level of the parties to the Master Separation Agreement.
The Master Separation Agreement also sets out the framework for the financing, cash
management and hedging of Siemens Energy Group (without SGRE) and the granting ofSecurities, including supply chain finance arrangements, for Siemens Energy (without SGRE) untilthe Spin-Off Completion and for the continuation until expiry, termination and redemptionthereof (see “ 18.1.1.1.3(1) Securities issued by banks or the Siemens Group ”).
The Master Separation Agreement also contains provisions regarding service agreements for a
transitional period of generally twelve months after the Spin-Off Completion by providing theframework for such agreements via transitional service terms & conditions. These serviceagreements may cover, among other things, data separation and migration, real estate and leaseagreements, stock-based participation programs, taxes, insurance, certain separation costs andfuture cooperation. For further information regarding Securities as well as bank and groupguarantees, see “ 18.1.1.1.3(1) Securities issued by banks or the Siemens Group ”.
(2) Spin-Off and Transfer Agreement (Abspaltungs- und Übernahmevertrag)
On May 22, 2020, Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG entered into the Spin-Off and Transfer
Agreement which was approved by the shareholders’ meetings of Siemens Energy AG andSiemens AG on May 22, 2020 and July 9, 2020, respectively. The Spin-Off and Transfer Agreementis yet to be registered with the commercial registers of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG inorder to become effective ( i.e., the Spin-Off Completion) which is expected to occur on
September 25, 2020. The agreement contains, among other things, the mandatory provisionspursuant to the German Transformation Act ( Umwandlungsgesetz ). This includes provisions on
the assets to be spun off as well as details of the transfer and consideration to be granted inreturn, including the allotment ratio of 2:1, i.e., two Siemens AG shares entitle to one Siemens
Energy AG share. Further, the Spin-Off and Transfer Agreement describes special rights, benefitsand consequences of the Spin-Off for employees and their representative bodies. The Spin-Offand Transfer Agreement further provides that Joe Kaeser shall act as chair of the SupervisoryBoard, while Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas is expected to head the audit committee. It contains anumber of annexes, such as: (i) the contribution agreement to create the Siemens Energy AGshares remaining with Siemens (see “ 5.2.3 The Capital Increases Against Contribution in Kind ”),
(ii) the rules applicable under stock entitlements, (iii) the Group Separation Agreement (asdefined below), (iv) the Deconsolidation Agreement (as defined below) and (v) the Articles ofAssociation of Siemens Energy AG and capital-related authorizations.
(3) Group Separation Agreement (Konzerntrennungsvertrag)
On May 22, 2020, Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG entered into a group separation
agreement ( Konzerntrennungsvertrag ) (the “ Group Separation Agreement ”) which governs the
legal relations between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG for the period after the Spin-OffCompletion.
458
The main elements of the Group Separation Agreement are:
 The parties shall indemnify each other and the companies within the relevant other party’s
group against any statutory or non-contractual liability with respect to liabilities that aroseprior to the Spin-Off Completion and that are attributable to the other parties’ business.
 In the context of the Listing, the parties agreed to take out a prospectus liability insurance. Any
liability not covered by the prospectus liability insurance ( i.e., if and to the extent no insurance
exists or no adequate compensation can be obtained for the respective damages) shall be splitbetween Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG at a ratio of 0.45 to 0.55.
 Siemens Energy AG is obligated to provide any information required by Siemens AG to satisfy
the requirements under IFRS with regard to its shareholding in Siemens Energy AG. This alsoapplies outside of the regular reporting of Siemens Energy AG to Siemens AG, in particular forthe purpose of timely responses to questions of the German Financial Reporting EnforcementPanel ( Deutsche Prüfstelle für Rechnungslegung ). Siemens Energy AG must also provide
information with regard to expected earnings per share which Siemens AG requires for its ownfinancial reporting. Siemens AG shall reimburse Siemens Energy AG for any external costsincurred by preparing the information. Furthermore, Siemens AG has undertaken to onlypublish information that directly, indirectly or by inference refers to the results of SiemensEnergy AG after Siemens Energy AG has published those results or with consent of SiemensEnergy AG. Siemens AG is obligated to provide information required by Siemens Energy AGwith regard to Siemens AG’s role as shareholder, in particular information on related party-transactions.
 Siemens Energy AG shall procure that certain assets contributed to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG
are recognized at their tax book values and that the required application with the competenttax office is filed in time. If Siemens Energy AG violates these obligations and taxes areimposed on Siemens AG or SBI GmbH, both of which hold shares in the Company, or their losscarry forwards for corporate income and trade tax purposes are reduced, Siemens Energy AGshall compensate Siemens AG or SBI GmbH. SBI GmbH has also contributed a limitedpartnership interest ( Kommanditanteil ) in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG to Siemens Energy AG in
return for being granted shares in Siemens Energy AG. In this regard, Siemens Energy AG isobligated to recognize this partnership interest at tax book value and file the requiredapplication with the competent tax office in time. If these obligations are violated, SiemensEnergy AG is liable to Siemens AG or SBI GmbH for taxes imposed on them or their loss carryforwards for corporate income tax purposes are reduced. The Group Separation Agreementfurther contains provisions in relation to shares held by Siemens AG or SBI GmbH that aresubject to a lock-up period ( sperrfristbehaftete Anteile ) for tax purposes in connection with the
separation of the Siemens Energy business. If a contribution gain ( Einbringungsgewinn )i s
assessed, the tax consequences at the level of Siemens AG and SBI GmbH together with thetrade tax arising at the level of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG may result in a total cash-out of upto a medium three digit million euro amount. Such tax cash-out may be compensated onlypartially by corresponding tax benefits, for which the cash effect may only arise over time. Incase Siemens Energy AG caused such assessment of the contribution gain ( e.g., by violating the
obligation to procure that Siemens Energy entities apply for tax book values or by triggeringan event pursuant to section 22 (1) sentence 6 of the German Transformation Tax Act(Umwandlungssteuergesetz )), Siemens Energy AG shall compensate Siemens AG or SBI GmbH
for the resulting tax consequences. In case such contribution gain is caused by Siemens AG orSBI GmbH, Siemens Energy AG may have a compensation claim against Siemens AG for tradetax or the reduction of trade tax loss carry-forwards resulting therefrom, whereas such claim isgenerally reduced by potential tax benefits arising for Siemens Energy AG and/or SE GlobalGmbH & Co. KG in case of a recognition of an increase amount in accordance withsection 23 (2) of the German Transformation Tax Act ( Umwandlungssteuergesetz ) (“step-up”).
To the extent that the potential step-up benefit exceeds the amount, which Siemens AG wouldhave to pay to Siemens Energy AG without the deduction of the step-up benefit, SiemensEnergy AG is obliged to pay to Siemens AG an amount equal to this difference, even though
459
the step-up benefit may not have materialized in a cash effect yet but would only materialize
over time. Finally, the parties of the Group Separation Agreement ( Konzerntrennungsvertrag )
shall cooperate with regard to tax matters and in case one party does not comply with itscooperation obligations, it shall indemnify the other party, i.e., if Siemens Energy AG is not
compliant it has to indemnify Siemens AG or the affected Siemens Group entity.
 Furthermore, the Group Separation Agreement specifies a mechanism for dispute resolution
and certain confidentiality standards regarding the Group Separation Agreement and itsperformance, including the sharing of information pursuant to the Group SeparationAgreement.
(4) Deconsolidation Agreement (Entherrschungsvertrag)
On May 22, 2020, Siemens AG and its subsidiary SBI GmbH entered into a deconsolidation
agreement ( Entherrschungsvertrag ) with Siemens Energy AG (the “ Deconsolidation
Agreement ”). Under the Deconsolidation Agreement Siemens AG and SBI GmbH have
undertaken vis-à-vis the Company to restrict the exercise of their voting rights, including voting
rights held by other Siemens Group companies at any time, in the Company to a level ensuringthat Siemens is not able or deemed to be able to exercise any controlling influence on theCompany and/or Siemens Energy Group companies after the Spin-Off Completion. TheDeconsolidation Agreement provides three main elements for this purpose:
 Siemens AG and SBI undertake that they shall restrict the exercise of voting rights from Shares
held by them in any shareholders’ meeting of the Company on the resolution of certainagenda items to an extent that shall ensure that such votes (together with votes from Sharesheld by affiliated companies and certain other related parties such as Siemens Pension-Truste.V.) can no longer carry a vote on its own. This applies to resolutions of the shareholders’meeting of the Company on the (i) appointment and removal of members of the SupervisoryBoard, (ii) certain management measures that are brought before the shareholders’ meeting ofthe Company, (iii) discharge ( Entlastung ) of members of the Executive Board and Supervisory
Board and votes of no confidence ( Vertrauensentzug ) with regard to members of the Executive
Board, (iv) remuneration of members of the Supervisory Board and remuneration system formembers of the Executive Board (including reductions permissible in exceptional circumstancesunder the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ) and (v) adoption of the annual
financial statements ( Jahresabschlüsse ), if exceptionally the shareholders’ meeting resolves on
such approval.
 Siemens undertakes to ensure that no more than three shareholder representatives who are
dependent on Siemens AG are members of the Supervisory Board at the same time. TheDeconsolidation Agreement contains undertakings of Siemens to achieve this goal as well ascriteria for the assessment of dependence. For purposes of the Deconsolidation Agreement,membership in the supervisory board of Siemens AG alone does not preclude independence.
 For the (re)election or removal of one member of the Supervisory Board (so-called “Special
Supervisory Board Member” – besonderes Aufsichtsratsmitglied ) who must be independent
from Siemens AG, Siemens shall exercise only a further reduced number of voting rightscompared to the general restriction on the exercise of voting rights at shareholders’ meetingsdescribed above. For resolutions on other independent Supervisory Board members the generalundertaking with regard to the restriction of voting rights applies.
In addition, the Deconsolidation Agreement contains rules for the transferability of shares in the
Company within the Siemens Group, the right of other shareholders of the Company to requestcompliance with the Deconsolidation Agreement as well as concluding provisions, in particularon the term, modalities of termination of the agreement and standard final provisions.
The Deconsolidation Agreement takes effect as of the Spin-Off Completion and has an initial
term until the end of the fifth annual shareholders’ meeting after the first shareholders’ meetingof the Company following the Spin-Off Completion at which an election of shareholderrepresentatives to the Supervisory Board was on the agenda. Prior to the end of that term, no
460
ordinary termination is possible. Thereafter, the Deconsolidation Agreement shall be extended
for revolving periods leading up to the end of each fifth annual shareholders’ meeting followingthereafter, unless terminated by any party prior to its expiry. The Deconsolidation Agreement canbe terminated for good cause, in particular at any time by any party if a sale of shares in theCompany by Siemens (including SBI GmbH) results in Siemens holding less than 15% of the sharesin the Company at the time of termination. Any termination is subject to merger controlclearance under competition law in certain jurisdictions specified in the DeconsolidationAgreement or if requested by either party.
(5) Agreements with regard to Siemens Energy’s Gas and Power Business in Algeria, Greece,
Indonesia and Pakistan
Mainly due to complex carve-out situations, local law restrictions or timing reasons, in particular
in Algeria, Greece, Indonesia and Pakistan, Siemens retained the gas and power business (forIndia, see “ 18.1.1.1.1(6) Agreements Related to the Conduct of Siemens Energy’s Gas and Power
Business in India ”), which is carried out by local Siemens Group companies (each a “ Local Siemens
Distributor ”). In these and certain other countries, Siemens Energy’s gas and power business is
carried out under agency and distributorship agreements that were concluded between SEGlobal GmbH & Co. KG and the respective Local Siemens Distributor (each an “ Agency and
Distributorship Agreement ”). The Agency and Distributorship Agreements were concluded under
framework agreements made between Siemens AG, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG and the respectiveLocal Siemens Distributor or between Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG (each a“Distributor Framework Agreement ”). Under the Agency and Distributorship Agreements, SE
Global GmbH & Co. KG appoints the respective Local Siemens Distributor, subject to certainexceptions, for the sale of products, systems and services relating to the gas and power businessof Siemens Energy (the “ Contractual Products ”) and the Local Siemens Distributor shall advertise,
promote, mediate and sell the Contractual Products. The Agency and Distributorship Agreementsalso govern, among other things, the use of the “Siemens Energy” trademark, the cooperationwith Siemens Energy Group companies, the training of personnel, the maintenance of anadequate sale force and a fee to be paid by Siemens Energy to the Local Siemens Distributor. Theterritorial scopes of the Agency and Distributorship Agreements for Algeria, Indonesia andPakistan in general cover only the respective countries, with certain specified legacy projects thatmay be completed outside such respective countries. In Greece, the territorial scope also coversCyprus (with the exception of the area administered by Turkish Cypriots north of the UnitedNations Buffer Zone), Albania and North Macedonia. The right to sell the Contractual Products isgenerally exclusive for Algeria, Indonesia and Pakistan, with certain exceptions applying underthe Agency and Distributorship Agreements, and generally non-exclusive for Greece. Under allAgency and Distributorship Agreements, Siemens Energy retains the right to directly sell certainContractual Products.
After termination of the Distributor Framework Agreements, which may occur in connection with a
termination of the associated Agency and Distributorship Agreement, Siemens Energy is obligatedto acquire the gas and power business of the Local Siemens Distributor at fair market value.
(6) Agreements Related to the Conduct of Siemens Energy’s Gas and Power Business in India
In India, business activities of Siemens Energy’s Gas and Power segment (with the exception of
the activities of Dresser-Rand India Private Limited which manufactures compressors and is mainlyactive in the oil & gas business) shall continue to be carried out by the local Siemens companySiemens India under an agency and distributorship agreement entered into between SE GlobalGmbH & Co. KG and Siemens India on March 30, 2020 (the “ Agency and Distributorship
Agreement India ”). With regard to the gas and power business, Siemens India does not only act

Furthermore, in order to faciliate their cooperation, the parties have entered into and mayin the future enter into agreements under which the Group provides technology and know-how,technical support, access to IT infrastructure as well as support in respect of bid qualification andproject execution.
(cc) Shareholders’ Agreement India
Under the Shareholders’ Agreement India, Siemens Group and Siemens Energy Group shall
coordinate their actions with respect to the exercise of their shareholder rights. SE GlobalGmbH & Co. KG shall procure that Siemens Energy in certain matters votes alongside Siemens AG.However, with regard to certain reserved matters relating to the Gas and Power business ofSiemens India, both parties have undertaken to exercise their voting rights only consensually. Ifno agreement can be reached, both parties shall refrain from voting on such matters. TheShareholders’ Agreement India also regulates the transferability of the shareholdings of Siemensand Siemens Energy.
Under the Shareholders’ Agreement India, Siemens has the option to purchase the shares held by
Siemens Energy in Siemens India if SE Global GmbH & Co. KG is in material breach of theShareholders’ Agreement India; this also extends to Siemens terminating the Agency andDistributorship Agreement India or certain existing technical assistance and license agreementsfor cause if Siemens Energy has set such cause. Siemens Energy has the option to sell its shares inSiemens India to Siemens if Siemens AG is in material breach of the Shareholders’ AgreementIndia and this also extends to Siemens Energy terminating the Agency and DistributorshipAgreement India or certain technical assistance and license agreements for cause if Siemens hasset such cause. Both these options (the “ Transfer Options India ”) are subject to further conditions
and certain remediation measures. The Shareholders’ Agreement India may be terminated byeither party (i) if another shareholder holds more than 25% in Siemens Energy or (ii) at any timeafter May 19, 2023.
In the event of either a termination of the Shareholders’ Agreement India or an exercise of either
of the Transfer Options India, the business activities attributable to Siemens and Siemens Energyin India shall be separated. The separation shall, subject to a final agreement between SiemensAG and Siemens Energy, the respective governmental and corporate approvals and the thenapplicable rules and regulations, including tax laws and takeover regulations, be carried out bytransferring the gas and power business of Siemens India into a subsidiary of Siemens India,which shall become a listed company.
After that, Siemens and Siemens Energy shall transfer their respective shareholdings in Siemens
India and the new listed company at respective fair market values, as further specified in theShareholders’ Agreement India.
Under the Shareholders’ Agreement India, the parties shall also indemnify each other against any
adverse tax consequences and brokerage fees arising in connection with the separation of theSiemens and Siemens Energy business activities in India. Siemens Energy shall also indemnifySiemens against adverse tax consequences if the Shareholders’ Agreement India is terminatedafter a change of control event. In the event of a regular termination at any time after May 19,2023, the terminating party shall indemnify the other party against indemnifiable taxes.
463
(7) Contributions (Agreements, Amendment(s)) / LATAs
In all other countries in which the respective local Siemens Energy business was not conducted in
a separate legal entity, the relevant local Siemens Energy business was separated from the otherSiemens business in general as of March 31, 2020 (Local Carve-Outs). The separations were largelyimplemented by formation of new local legal entities to which the local Siemens Energy businesswas transferred either through corporate or transformation law measures under local law ( e.g.,
through spin-offs) or based on purchase agreements (carve-outs). Certain carve-outs may beaccompanied by additional follow-up measures, such as the registration of branches, to make therespective local businesses fully operational. In a classic carve-out, generally Siemens would beheld liable for obligations or otherwise affected by consequences arising from former activitiesthat are attributable to Siemens Energy. It has therefore been agreed in each case that therespective local Siemens Energy company will indemnify Siemens from any such liability.
In other countries, Siemens’ businesses pertaining to Siemens Energy’s gas and power business
were separated by means of a so-called “reverse carve-out” (shares in companies in relation toSiemens’ local business were transferred to Siemens Energy, with the local Siemens businessbeing carved-out into a Siemens Group company) and transferred under LATAs. These LATAswere entered into between the respective local transferring company of the Siemens Group, astransferor of the assets, and the respective local acquiring company of the Siemens Group foreach country as transferee (see “ 5.2.2 Rest of World Carve-Out ”). The transfers were carried out
in the form of sales, contributions in kind, demergers or similar methods or contractualrelationships under local law of the countries in which the transferred businesses are located. Theshares in the local Siemens Energy Group companies, which, following the execution of theLATAs, basically only hold the respective local Siemens Energy business, were transferred toSiemens Gas and Power Holding B.V. by selling the shares in the local Siemens Energy Groupcompany on the basis of purchase agreements (Local Share Transfer Agreements, “ LSTAs ”). In
some cases, the respective local Siemens Energy Group company was already formed and fundedfor the acquisition of the respective local Siemens Energy business. In other cases, certain localSiemens Energy businesses, especially the local Siemens Energy business in the United States,were not separated by way of a local Carve-Out; instead the shares in the already existing localSiemens Energy Group companies were contributed into or transferred to SE Global GmbH & Co.KG or Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V., and, in some of these cases, minor business activitiesnot related to the Siemens Energy business were agreed to be wound down.
Depending on the relevant jurisdiction, the business transferred pursuant to the LATAs included
the transfer (or assumption of) tangible assets, IP, contracts, liabilities, real estate, leases or realestate-related services, employee relationships and related liabilities, litigations, permits and allother relevant assets. The consideration for the transfers was in most cases based on a valuationof an independent auditor or on internal valuations.
As a consequence, in reverse carve-out situations, Siemens Energy may be held liable for
obligations, or may be affected by other consequences from earlier activities that areattributable to the local remaining Siemens business and thus, the LATAs specify that the SiemensGroup shall indemnify Siemens Energy against any liabilities arising out of or in connection withthe transferred businesses, with the exception of tax liabilities pertaining to periods untilcarve-out effective date, that must generally be borne by the company upon which they areimposed. These rules apply in reverse to classic carve-outs, i.e., Siemens Energy is then obligated
to indemnify Siemens with the aforementioned exception for tax liabilities. The LATAs alsoexpressly regulate the allocation of potential liabilities relating to litigation cases pending as ofthe effective date of the relevant LATA that were attributable to the transferred business. Withrespect to pending litigation, the general principle of the LATAs is that each party shall be putinto the economic position it would assume if the pending litigation had been transferred. Incertain countries, such as Brazil, where a reverse carve-out took place, this principle also appliesunder the relevant LATAs with respect to litigation arising in connection with the businessescarved out into a Siemens Group company (see “ 12.8 Legal and Administrative Proceedings ”).
464
Under the LATAs, none of the transferring Siemens Group companies made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, or assumed any responsibility or liability for, or as to, the status ofthe acquired business or any part thereof.
A separate local asset transfer agreement in relation to the so-called “T3000 business” (business
of development and maintenance of power plant control systems) has been concluded betweenSiemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co KG on March 31, 2020, which becomes effective onAugust 1, 2020. Under this agreement, certain tangible assets, contracts, including all receivablesand liabilities, employees and IP rights owned by Siemens AG relating to T3000 business havebeen transferred to SE Global GmbH & Co KG. Siemens AG received certain back-licenses inrelation to the transferred IP rights and improvements and modifications of inventionsunderlying the IP rights made by Siemens Energy that allow Siemens AG to continuedevelopment of T3000 technology and its use in its own solutions. However, it does not allowSiemens AG to provide maintenance of certain power plants using the T3000 technology inunmodified form or to use or market T3000 solution in unmodified form. In addition the sameparties have entered into a related long term services agreement. Further related agreements,e.g., a supply agreement and a cooperation agreement, will have been concluded or should be
concluded until the end of September 2020. These agreements predominantly govern the supplyof certain T3000 related products by Siemens AG to Siemens Energy as well as certain forms ofsupport by Siemens Energy to Siemens AG in relation to hardware and software products.
Furthermore, the Siemens operations IT as well as controlling and finance units were transferred
as of August 1, 2020 as well. Conversely, there was a retransfer from SE Global GmbH & Co. KG toSiemens AG of an operating unit in the area of operational project logistics as of August 1, 2020.
For risks relating to erroneous transfers of assets or liabilities or failures to transfer assets or
liabilities, see “ 3.5.7 We are exposed to risks arising from indemnities which we have granted to
Siemens in connection with our separation from Siemens. In addition, as part of this separation,assets or liabilities may have been incorrectly allocated, which may require us to transfer certainassets to or assume further liabilities from Siemens. ”. Furthermore, we may agree with Siemens
on the transfer of further assets and liabilities in the future.
(8) German Contribution Agreement
On December 20, 2019, Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG concluded a contribution
agreement agreeing the details of the Germany Carve-Out (the “ German Contribution
Agreement ”). Under the German Contribution Agreement, Siemens AG transferred all assets
directly held by Siemens AG and attributable to Siemens’ German Gas and Power business to SEGlobal GmbH & Co. KG, except for real estate (see “ 18.1.1.1.1(10) Transfer of Real Estate ”) and
certain newly created central departments for Siemens Energy (the “ German GP Business ”). The
asset transfers became effective on January 1, 2020 and as consideration, Siemens AG’s limitedpartner interest ( Kommanditanteil ) in SE Global GmbH & Co. KG was increased.
In particular, the following transfers were regulated by the German Contribution Agreement: Tangible assets (including loose plant, machinery, equipment, tools, vehicles, assets under
construction), IT hardware and other tangible IT systems (excluding software), raw materialsand supplies, spare parts, works in progress, finished goods and merchandise, including anyrelated rights, title and interest, all books of accounts and other files, records and documentswere transferred to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG.
 Siemens AG transferred shares in legal entities directly held by it and allocated to the German
GP Business to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG as well as a shareholding of approximately 30% inSGRE S.A. Among other shareholdings, Siemens also transferred its minority interests of 35% ineach of Voith Hydro Holding GmbH & Co. KG and its general partner ( Komplementär ) Voith
Hydro Holding Verwaltungs GmbH, which is active in the field of power generation and offerscomponents for various hydro power plants and the associated service business, and itsminority shareholding of 49% in EthosEnergy Group Limited, which is a joint venture formed in2014 with John Wood Group PLC providing services for rotating equipment such as gas
465
turbines and using IP and tool licenses for its business that belong to the Siemens Energy
business.
 Employment relationships with approximately 26,000 employees were transferred to SE Global
GmbH & Co. KG which also assumed pension liabilities relating to such employees. SiemensEnergy has set up a CTA that acts as pension trust (GP Trust e.V.). In connection herewith, theCTA has been funded with assets that had a fair value of approximately €915 million as of
January 2, 2020 to the account of GP Trust e.V. as pension trustee. In addition, assets for thedeferred compensation plan with a fair value of approximately €101 million as of
December 31, 2019 were transferred on March 24, 2020 (already accounted for as plan assets atSE Global GmbH & Co. KG as of German carve-out date) (for further information on SiemensEnergy’s pension obligations, see “ 9.9.6.2 Pensions and Similar Obligations ”).
 The following IP rights that were owned by Siemens AG were transferred by it to SE Global
GmbH & Co. KG: (i) patents for which the Gas and Power business had incurred the majority ofcosts, (ii) trademarks exclusively used by the Gas and Power business and funded by the Gasand Power business, provided that they do not contain any Siemens designations,(iii) know-how and software in object code format predominantly used and software in sourcecode format predominantly financed by the Gas and Power business, (iv) domainspredominantly used by the Gas and Power business and (v) copyrights in relation to thetransferred tangible assets, patents, know-how, software and domains. In relation to thetransferred patents, know-how, software and copyrights, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG grantednon-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid-up use rights to Siemens AG toconduct any activities in the defined current business field of Siemens AG and its affiliates.Under certain circumstances, the license is transferrable and sub-licensable. In relation topatents, know-how, software and copyrights that are owned by Siemens AG and were nottransferred to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG but which are used by the Gas and Power business,Siemens AG granted SE Global GmbH & Co. KG non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual,irrevocable and fully-paid-up use rights to conduct any activities in the defined current businessfield of the Gas and Power business as it has been conducted on October 1, 2019. IP rights thatprotect products or services that are part of the portfolio of the remaining Siemens Groupwhich have been purchased by the Gas and Power business prior to the effective date of thecarve-out are neither transferred nor licensed to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG. SE Global GmbH &Co. KG may continue to purchase such products or services from Siemens AG and its affiliates.With regard to certain technologies, products, services and related IP, the parties agreed tofind separate case specific solutions which may deviate from the German ContributionAgreement, e.g., in relation to Siemens AG’s remote service platform cRSP by means of a
service and a development service agreement.
 Furthermore, Siemens AG transferred all permits, including export licenses and customs
authorizations, required to carry out the German GP Business to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG aswell as permanent establishments.
Under the German Contribution Agreement, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG also assumed liabilities
under transferred contracts that required, as the case may be, the counterparty’s consent prior toany transfer and other liabilities. Among the assumed liabilities are liabilities in connection withthe repair or replacement of defective goods or with remedy of services and for damages causedby sold products or rendered services, liabilities for infringement of third party’s IP rights, andliabilities in relation to security granted over assets transferred to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG. Incases where the counterparty’s consent, albeit necessary for the transfer obligations, could not beobtained, Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG have agreed to be put in the sameeconomic position as if the respective obligations had been transferred.
Under the German Contribution Agreement, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG has undertaken vis-à-vis
Siemens AG to upon request use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that SGRE dischargesSecurities granted by Siemens Group companies and has assumed joint and several liabilitytowards Siemens AG for SGRE’s payment obligations arising in connection with such Securities, inparticular for the payment of due security fees, interest, expenses and other costs.
466
Furthermore, the German Contribution Agreement regulates the allocation of potential liabilities
relating to litigation cases pending as of the effective date of the German ContributionAgreement that were attributable to the German GP Business (the “ Pending Litigation ”). The
German Contribution Agreement provides that each party shall be put into the economicposition it would assume if the Pending Litigation had been transferred.
In connection with a contract for the construction of the “Olkiluoto 3” nuclear power plant in
Finland for Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO), Siemens AG will continue to be externally liable vis-à-vis TVO and Siemens AG’s consortium partners. Due to a significant delay of the project, TVOwill likely raise delay claims against the consortium or may pursue termination of the contract,potentially triggering additional significant claims from TVO. As between Siemens AG andSiemens Energy, Siemens Energy will be responsible for the execution of the project. Siemens AGhas agreed to cover certain potential claims of TVO, to the extent these claims exceed€83 million. However, in certain cases Siemens Energy may have to first satisfy such claims vis-à
-vis TVO and may only be able to obtain relief from Siemens AG following legal proceedingsagainst Siemens AG’s consortium partners. As a result, Siemens Energy may not be able to obtainthe aforementioned relief in time or in full, which could have a significant financial impact onSiemens Energy. Apart from the foregoing, Siemens Energy will be entitled to all benefits andbear all risks associated with the project execution and Siemens AG’s position as a party to theconsortium agreement, including risks related to delays or non-completion of the project. Any ofthese risks, if they materialize, may result in substantial losses.
Furthermore and with exception to the Olkiluoto 3 project, the German Contribution Agreement
provides that SE Global GmbH & Co. KG shall indemnify Siemens against any liabilities arising outof or in connection with, the transferred German GP Business.
Under the German Contribution Agreement, Siemens AG made no representation or warranty,
express or implied, or assumed any responsibility or liability for, or as to, the status of thebusiness acquired by SE Global GmbH & Co. KG or any part thereof.
(9) Siemens France Holding S.A.S. participation in Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V.
The local Siemens Energy Group company in France was transferred to Siemens Gas and Power
Holding B.V. by way of a contribution. In return, the transferring French company remaining inthe Siemens Group, Siemens France Holding S.A.S., received a 1.7% share in Siemens Gas andPower Holding B.V. in which the respective local Siemens Energy business of a large number ofcountries was bundled. This shareholding in Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V. is expected tocontinue at least until June 2022. After this date, Siemens France Holding S.A.S. has the right tosell its shares to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG under a shareholders’ agreement.
(10) Transfer of Real Estate
The ownership of real property in Germany attributable to the German GP Business was not
subject to the German Contribution Agreement because this real property had already beenbundled in Siemens Gas and Power Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG (“ GP Real Estate GmbH & Co.
KG”). Under a sale and transfer agreement dated March 27, 2020 (the “ GP Real Estate STA ”),
Siemens AG sold to a wholly-owned subsidiary of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG (the “ Purchaser ”) a
partial partnership interest ( Teil-Kommanditanteil ) representing 89% of the fixed capital
(Festkapital ) of GP Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG as well as all of the shares in the sole general
partner ( Komplementär ) of GP Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG. With respect to Siemens AG’s
remaining partnership interest ( Kommanditanteil ) of 11% in GP Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG,
Siemens AG was granted an option to sell such remaining partnership interest ( Kommanditanteil )
to the Purchaser. The sale option is exercisable at any time until April 21, 2022. If the sale optionlapses, the Purchaser may at any time beginning on April 21, 2023 exercise an option to acquiresuch remaining partnership interest ( Kommanditanteil ) under the GP Real Estate STA. Under each
option right, the purchase price shall correspond to the fair market value and is to be determinedby a neutral expert on the basis of predetermined valuation criteria.

The remuneration of Siemens AG shall generally be based ona fixed hourly rate that has been primarily based on costs of the services.
The agreement has a fixed initial term until May 31, 2022. The agreement shall automatically be
extended for periods of one year each, unless terminated by either party on giving six months’written notice.
(3) IP-related cooperation and license agreements
In relation to certain technological topics, Siemens and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG entered into
certain agreements governing the cooperation and licensing that may also include certainrestrictions on sublicensing, in the field of IP rights. For example, on March 30, 2020 Siemens AGand SE Global GmbH & Co. KG entered into an agreement on order developments stipulatingthat certain agreements for development orders previously entered into by specific Siemens AGunits, one of which has been transferred to SE Global GmbH & Co KG in the course of theCarve-Out, will be continued by Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co KG. On March 27, 2020,Siemens and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG entered into a technology transfer and license agreementand a joint IP agreement concerning vacuum interrupters. Siemens and SE Global GmbH & Co. KGalso entered into contracts governing insulation systems or the trademark “Micalastic”.
With effect as of March 30, 2020, Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG entered into a
framework development agreement mainly in the field of signal processing of low powerinstrument transformer sensors for protection and metering applications which shall governindividual development agreements between the parties for the development of know-how and
469
IP rights by Siemens AG for SE Global GmbH & Co. KG against remuneration. SE Global GmbH &
Co. KG shall become the owner of the development results. The agreement has a fixed term untilMay 31, 2023, unless its term is extended.
18.1.1.1.3 Financing and Treasury
Until the Spin-Off Completion, Siemens Group companies will continue to cooperate with
Siemens Energy in a variety of financing and treasury fields, such as factoring, financing andleasing, debt, commercial and equity financing, the provision of software for the management ofcurrency risks or other treasury related services. Following the Spin-Off, Siemens Groupcompanies will generally not provide financing or finance and treasury services to SiemensEnergy, with the exception of certain IT-tools, or in relation to the preferred financingagreement (see “ 18.1.1.1.3(2) Preferred Financing Agreement ”), and Siemens and Siemens
Energy will continue to be bound by guarantee facility agreements (see “ 18.1.1.1.3(3) Guarantee
Facility Agreement(s) ”).
(1) Securities issued by banks or the Siemens Group
Letters of support and other securities provided by Siemens AG in favor of banks, insurance
companies and other financial institutions which have granted loans or provided other financingproducts (loans, Securities, documentary letters of credit, derivatives) to the Siemens EnergyGroup companies are intended to be replaced by Siemens Energy AG after the Spin-OffCompletion.
Under the Master Separation Agreement, Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG agreed that
the direct or indirect issuance or extension of Securities for the obligations of Siemens EnergyGroup companies (other than SGRE) shall be performed in accordance with past practice until thecompletion of the Spin-Off. In general, the issuance and extension of Securities is done throughSiemens AG and certain other Siemens Group companies as well as through guarantee and suretylines of Siemens AG, other Siemens Group companies or Siemens Energy Group companies (otherthan SGRE) with banks and insurance companies. However, the respective Siemens Energy Groupcompany is liable vis-à-vis the relevant Siemens Group company for any obligation in relation to
the Securities. SE Global GmbH & Co. KG agreed with Siemens AG to be jointly and severallyliable for such obligations. This applies to the following Securities:
 Siemens AG has issued letters of support and other securities for local credit, guarantee, surety
and documentary letter of credit lines as well as currency, interest and commodity pricehedging transactions of Siemens Energy Group companies (with the exception of SGRE) for thebenefit of banks and insurance companies as well as other financial institutions. As of June 30,2020, credit, guarantee, surety and documentary letter of credit lines as well as currency,interest and commodity price hedging transactions in the amount of approximately €7 billion
were secured through letters of support or other Securities of Siemens AG. Not included aretransactions that Siemens AG conducted itself or through its own lines.
 Moreover, Siemens Group companies or instructed banks and insurance companies have issued,
in some cases for a long-term or unlimited period, Securities to suppliers, customers andbusiness partners and joint ventures of Siemens Energy Group companies to secure thefulfilment of contractual obligations. For the benefit of Siemens Energy Group companies (withthe exception of SGRE) the volume is approximately €23.7 billion as of June 30, 2020. This
amount was calculated on the assumption that the amount of liability under accessory parentcompany guarantees, to the extent that these are unlimited, correspond in general to thevalue of the secured delivery or service agreement recognized for its term. Following theSpin-Off Completion, the initial value of the secured delivery or service agreement shall bereduced linearly over the planned term of such agreement, resulting in a correspondingreduction of the accessory liability amount of the respective parent company guarantee andthe calculation of the fees owed in relation to a parent company guarantee for its provisionshall be based on such reduced amount, unless a differing risk assessment and increasedamount of liability is justified (such amount a “ Risk-Adequate Liability Amount ”).
470
Under the Master Separation Agreement, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to procure that Siemens Group companies are discharged from the above-mentioned Securities. Until such discharge, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, starting six months afterSpin-Off Completion, shall report quarterly to Siemens AG on the measures undertaken toachieve such discharge. To procure the discharges, the following actions are planned:
 Siemens Energy companies shall use reasonable endeavors to establish own lines for the
provision of Securities with banks and insurance companies. These may initially be secured by aletter of support or other Securities provided by Siemens AG or other Siemens Groupcompanies and shall be discharged and replaced with a letter of support or other Securitiesgranted by Siemens Energy AG after the Spin-Off Completion. Until such letters of support arereplaced, Siemens Energy shall pay a fee to Siemens. Letters of support provided by SiemensAG shall terminate on April 30, 2021, at the latest. The fees for the fiscal year 2021 shallamount to approximately €1 million if there is no early replacement. In principle, outstanding
Securities shall not be amended or extended after the Spin-Off Completion; in particular, noamendment or extension shall be made that would increase the risk for Siemens Groupcompanies. Until expiration or discharge of the Securities, Siemens Energy companies shall paythe agreed fees. Payment obligations towards Siemens AG and other Siemens Groupcompanies are secured by SE Global GmbH & Co. KG. For the fiscal year 2021, fees for suchSecurities are estimated to amount to €29 million (without fees for Securities provided in
favor of SGRE). For the fiscal years thereafter, continuous reductions of such amount areexpected due to the expiration and/or discharge of such Securities or because of the above-mentioned linear depreciation of the guaranteed values over their term.
 It is further intended, to the extent commercially reasonable, to transfer the Securities issued
by banks or insurance companies securing Siemens Energy businesses under Siemens Grouplines to lines of Siemens Energy companies at the latest after the Spin-Off.
To the extent Siemens Group companies have themselves issued or shall issue Securities,
Siemens Energy shall endeavor to agree with the beneficiaries that the beneficiaries will, at alater time and under certain conditions, accept a replacement of Securities by Siemens EnergyAG or other Siemens Energy Group companies or banks on lines of Siemens Energy anddischarge Siemens Group companies from their liabilities. Siemens Energy Group companies aregenerally obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to procure the discharge ofSecurities granted by Siemens Group companies.
Since the discharge of Securities usually requires the consent of the beneficiaries, and, as the case
may be, of banks and insurance companies, it can be assumed that a large part of the Securitiesportfolio shall continue to exist after the Spin-Off Completion until the end of the term of thesecured liabilities.
To the extent that Siemens Energy Group companies have issued or instructed Securities for the
benefit of the remaining Siemens business, which is relevant for the separation of the Siemensand Siemens Energy business by means of reverse carve-outs, Siemens AG or other Siemens Groupcompanies are obligated to and shall discharge these Securities or shall issue replacementSecurities. Siemens shall continue to pay fees until the discharge. Siemens AG shall be jointly andseverally liable for the due performance of any such obligations of the Siemens GroupCompanies. This discharge also normally requires the consent of the beneficiary.
Moreover, Siemens Group companies have concluded guarantee facility agreements with SGRE
for the provision of Securities. The volume of these Securities amounted to approximately€17.9 billion as of June 30, 2020 (on the basis of Risk-Adequate Liability Amounts). SGRE pays
fees for the provision of Securities to Siemens Group companies and is liable for all expenses,costs and, in particular, for the fulfillment of payment obligations under the Securities.
Under the German Contribution Agreement, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG has assumed the
obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to procure that SGRE discharges such Securitiesand has assumed joint and several liability for SGRE’s obligations, inter alia for the payment ofdue Security fees, expenses and other costs.
471
(2) Preferred Financing Agreement
On March 31, 2020, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG and Siemens AG entered into a preferred financing
agreement (the “ Preferred Financing Agreement ”) which becomes effective as of the Spin-Off
Completion. It governs the non-exclusive cooperation in the areas of debt and commercialfinancing (in particular leasing) as well as equity financing of Gas and Power customers and theirprojects (including power plant projects) at arm’s length. Debt financing comprises the provisionof debt capital via standard market debt financing structures. Standard finance leasing structurescan also be the subject of cooperation. In general, no recourse to Siemens Energy Groupcompanies shall be made in connection with debt financing and finance lease structures.
The following framework conditions were agreed for equity financing (in particular for project
companies):
 For equity financing in the first five years of the term of the Preferred Financing Agreement,
Siemens AG has agreed to make available an investment volume of up to €300 million per
annum . For the following five-year period, the parties agreed that any sales revenue from the
equity portfolio of assets acquired within the first five years under the Preferred FinancingAgreement, but at least €500 million, shall be available for new equity investments under the
Preferred Financing Agreement. For equity financing, Siemens AG’s individual investmentdecision follows a portfolio approach which takes into account new and existing investments.
 In addition, equity financings up to a total volume of €210 million may be made in
extraordinary cases by Siemens AG via a recourse model, subject to full recourse to SE GlobalGmbH & Co. KG or Siemens Energy AG. In such cases, profits and losses resulting from theinvestments shall be borne by SE Global GmbH & Co. KG or Siemens Energy AG. Siemens AGbears the risk that recourse to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG or Siemens Energy AG may fail.
Services under the Preferred Financing Agreement shall be provided by SFS and its associated
financing companies including Siemens Bank GmbH.
The Preferred Financing Agreement has a fixed term until September 30, 2030. However, either
party may prematurely terminate the Preferred Financing Agreement, among other reasons, if(i) Siemens directly or indirectly holds less than 25% of the shares and/or voting rights in theCompany (excluding shares directly or indirectly held by Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. and/or anyother entity holding or managing plan assets under or in connection with Siemens Group’sbenefit plans) or (ii) another shareholder of the Company, either individually or acting in concertwith others, holds 25% or more of the shares and/or voting rights in the Company or exercisescontrol over the Company, in both cases, (i) and (ii), with a phase-out period of 36 months fromthe receipt of an effective termination notice. In the case of a termination pursuant to item (i),however, the receipt of a termination notice during the first three years of the term of thePreferred Financing Agreement results in the 36-month phase notice period commencing on thethird anniversary of the Spin-Off Completion. Either party may also, subject to certain furtherconditions, inter alia, terminate the Preferred Financing Agreement if the other party has failedin the performance of any material obligations or the respective other party becomes insolventor an application to open insolvency proceedings is filed and not dismissed.
(3) Guarantee Facility Agreement(s)
The relevant Siemens companies and Siemens Energy companies have concluded guarantee
facility agreements in all countries where Securities for the obligations of Siemens Energy Groupcompanies (other than SGRE) are existing on the date of the facility agreement and/or are beingissued, extended, renewed or amended until and excluding the Spin-Off Completion. Theguarantee facility agreements relate to Securities that have been issued by Siemens companies orthat Siemens companies have instructed under their guarantee facility agreements with banks orinsurance companies. In countries where a reverse-carve out took place, similar guarantee facilityagreements have been or will be entered into on a vice versa basis with exchanged roles ofSiemens companies (requesting a guarantee) and Siemens Energy companies (providing theguarantee). Siemens may provide corporate Securities after Spin-Off Completion for contractsrelating to the Siemens Energy business that could not be transferred to Siemens Energy. It is
472
intended to individually agree that the terms and conditions of the guarantee facility
agreements, relating to classical carve-outs and reverse carve-outs, mentioned in this paragraphwill apply.
(4) Lease Agreements, Purchase of Receivables
Certain Siemens Energy Group companies have in the past entered into and continue to enter
into lease agreements with SFS. The Siemens Energy Group companies act as lessee. The leaseagreements mostly focus on operating leasing. Such agreements are rent-like lease agreementswith relatively long terms of usually one to ten years covering mobile assets, in particular variouslogistics, production and test equipment. Generally, there is no ordinary right of termination.Siemens Energy Group companies also entered into finance lease agreements that cover movableassets and typically have terms between two and eight years with no ordinary right oftermination. Siemens Energy Group companies have in the past entered into and may continueto enter into purchase agreements for receivables with SFS, where the Siemens Energy Groupcompanies act as sellers of receivables to finance themselves. The receivables sold are from thecompanies’ operating business. The purchased receivables usually have a remaining term of up tothree and a half years.
(5) Cash Management; Hedging
The system of intercompany clearing accounts and cash management (including cash pooling)
between the Siemens Energy Group and the Siemens Group shall be terminated in connectionwith the Spin-Off Completion. Therefore, the balances from the cash management systembetween Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG existing at that time will be settled viaexternal bank accounts. SE Global GmbH & Co. KG shall operate its own cash management systemfor the Siemens Energy Group (without SGRE) on the basis of a clearing account star(Verrechnungskontenstern ) set up as part of the Carve-Out. The cash management is governed by
the following agreements:
 Siemens AG maintains internal clearing accounts for its affiliated companies (without SGRE) to
settle payment claims and payment obligations of the affiliated Siemens Group companies thatarise from the provision of goods and services, the settlement of hedges and other treasurytransactions between Siemens companies. Under an agency agreement and its amendmentagreement existing between Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, Siemens AG instructsSE Global GmbH & Co. KG, as the central treasury unit of Siemens Energy, to establish aclearing account star ( Verrechnungskontenstern ) for the Siemens Energy Group companies
(without SGRE) starting as of January 1, 2020 and to maintain clearing accounts for theSiemens Energy Group companies (without SGRE). The agreement shall end upon Spin-OffCompletion.
 The balance transfer agreements were concluded between (i) Siemens AG and (ii), as the case
may be other treasury companies of the Siemens Group which like Siemens AG maintainclearing accounts for Siemens Energy companies, (iii) SE Global GmbH & Co. KG and (iv) therespective Siemens Energy companies. The purpose of the balance transfer agreements was totransfer balances on the clearing accounts of the Siemens Group to SE Global GmbH & Co. KGas the treasury unit and owner of the clearing account star ( Verrechnungskontenstern ) for the
Siemens Energy Group companies (without SGRE).
At the latest upon Spin-Off Completion, the Siemens Energy Group will independently manage
its currency, interest rate and commodity price risks and shall independently enter into respectivehedging derivatives ( Währung-, Zins- und Rohstoffpreissicherungsderivate ). The currency, interest
rate and commodity price hedging transactions concluded by individual Siemens Energy Groupcompanies with Siemens Group companies shall be terminated or novated in connection with theSpin-Off unless an individual Siemens Energy Group company and the respective Siemens Groupcompany counterpart conclude an agreement stipulating that hedging transactions, the expirydate of which falls within a twelve-month period after the Spin-Off Completion, are neitherterminated nor novated. In case of a termination, the market values of the derivativetransactions need to be settled between the relevant parties. For more information, see
473
“3.5.2 We may face difficulties in satisfying certain treasury and finance requirements as well as
performing certain services and functions that historically were provided by the Siemens Group. ”.
(6) Evonik Marl VI and VII agreements with Siemens Finance & Leasing GmbH
Siemens Finance & Leasing GmbH (“ SF&L ”) entered into several agreements with SE Global
GmbH & Co. KG in connection with providing finance leasing to our customer Evonik in thecontext of financing the erection by us of the Evonik Marl VI and VII power plants. Each financelease structure includes an accession agreement governing the entry as principal of SF&L into theEPC contract with SE Global GmbH & Co. KG instead of Evonik Operations GmbH, a transferagreement ( Ausübungsüberlassung ) concerning the limited personal encumbrance ( beschränkte
persönliche Dienstbarkeit ) granted by Evonik Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG to SF&L, a utilization
agreement ( Verwertungsvereinbarung ) between SE Global GmbH & Co KG, SF&L, the security
trustee, Evonik Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG and Evonik Operations GmbH and guarantees bySiemens AG were or are to be provided under each EPC contract.
18.1.1.1.4 Trademark and Name Use (Sub-)License Agreement with Siemens Energy
On March 31, 2020, Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG entered into a trademark and
name use (sub-) license agreement (the “ SE TLA ”) that shall enter into force with the Spin-Off
Completion. After the Spin-Off has taken effect, the SE TLA may be transferred to SiemensEnergy AG with the approval of Siemens AG which may not be unreasonably withheld.
Under the SE TLA, Siemens AG grants SE Global GmbH & Co. KG the exclusive right to, among
other things, use the combined designation “Siemens Energy” in the company name, internetand e-mail domains and the trademarks “SIEMENS Energy” as corporate mark and as productmark (the “ SE Mark ”) as well as the non-exclusive right to use certain “Si-” product marks (the
“SE Licensed Designations ”). The right to use the SE Licensed Designations is granted for the
business field in which the Siemens segment Gas and Power was active as of October 1, 2019 orwhich were defined in the business mandate of this segment at that time (including certainproducts and services that were the subject of R&D activities ongoing at that time) with theexception of the business area of SGRE (the “ SE Current Field ”).
Siemens AG shall also neither use nor otherwise license the “Siemens Energy” trademark outside
of the SE Current Field. SE TLA does not, however, prevent Siemens AG from operating under thetrademark “Siemens” with or without further additions (with the exception of the addition“Energy”) in the SE Current Field or future business areas of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG.
For the duration of the SE TLA, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG is obligated to use the designation
“Siemens Energy” as the company name and the trademark “Siemens Energy” in the SE CurrentField at all application levels (company and product trademark). Businesses conducted underthird-party trademarks ( e.g., “Guascor” or “Trench”) at the time of the conclusion of the SE TLA
shall continue to be managed separately. With respect to the business managed under “Dresser-Rand”, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG is free to either continue to manage this business separately orto convert it to “Siemens Energy”. In the event that SE Global GmbH & Co. KG, within the SECurrent Field, acquires a business from a third party or forms a joint venture over which it hascontrol, then SE Global GmbH & Co. KG may decide, in its own discretion, whether the newlyacquired business shall use the “Siemens Energy” trademark under the conditions set forth aboveor whether the business shall be conducted within a separate company without the use of thedesignation “Siemens Energy”.
To the extent that SE Global GmbH & Co. KG engages in new business areas outside of the SE
Current Field that do not overlap with Siemens’ business fields at the time, either throughorganic growth or acquisitions, the parties to the SE TLA, upon the request of SE Global GmbH &Co. KG, shall discuss an expansion in good faith, the consent to which Siemens AG may notunreasonably withhold, subject to detailed provisions which set forth the conditions under whichSiemens AG may provide its consent for the expansion of the business fields under the SE TLA.However, in case of an overlap with Siemens business fields no expansion shall be granted. IfSiemens AG does not permit the use of the trademark, SE Global GmbH & Co. KG may only
474
operate in the new business area through a separate company which is not entitled to use the
name and trademark “Siemens Energy”.
SE Global GmbH & Co. KG is entitled and (with the exception of the above-mentioned business
conducted under third-party trademarks) obligated to grant a sublicense to affiliated companies,including Siemens Energy AG, for the use of the “Siemens Energy” trademark in accordance withthe provisions of the SE TLA and to ensure that they are obligated to use the designation“Siemens Energy” in the SE Current Field.
SE Global GmbH & Co. KG shall pay a margin-based license fee for the use of the “Siemens
Energy” trademark. This license fee depends on the EBITA margin of Siemens Energy (excludingSGRE) as adjusted for certain special items as set forth in the SE TLA (“ TLA Specific EBITA
Margin ”) and ranges between 0.3% (if the TLA Specific EBITA Margin is less than or equal to
6.5%) and 1.2% (if the TLA Specific EBITA Margin is equal to or greater than 9%) of revenue(excluding sales tax) generated with products and services under the “Siemens Energy”trademark or, until the transition to the “Siemens Energy” trademark, under the “Siemens”trademark. Based on a projection as of June 30, 2020, the license fee to be paid by SE GlobalGmbH & Co. KG for fiscal year 2020 would amount to a mid-double-digit million euro figure. Theadequacy of the license fee shall be reviewed at regular intervals.
The SE TLA has a fixed initial term of ten years and automatically extends by further 3-year
revolving term unless terminated by either party. Siemens AG may terminate the SE TLA withimmediate effect, subject to staggered transition periods, upon the occurrence of certaintermination events including the following:
(i) Siemens AG (directly or indirectly) holds less than 25% of the shares and/or voting rights in
the Company (excluding shares directly or indirectly held by Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. orany other entity holding or managing plan assets under or in connection with SiemensGroup’s benefit plans) and provided that such termination may become effective earliest onSeptember 25, 2023;
(ii) a substantial competitor of Siemens Group holds more than 15% of the shares and/or voting
rights in the Company;
(iii) a sovereign wealth fund or a financial investor holds more than 25% of the shares and/or
voting rights in the Company;
(iv) another person holds more than 25% of the shares and/or voting rights in the Company; or(v) SE Global GmbH & Co. KG is no longer an affiliated company of the Company or the
Company no longer carries the designation “Siemens” in its company name;
(vi) if SE Global GmbH & Co. KG fails to establish and maintain certain best industry practices as
defined in the SE TLA (such as the obligation to establish and maintain a compliance systemin line with industry standards).
Moreover, either party may terminate the SE TLA with immediate effect subject to staggered
transition periods, (i) if the other party has committed a material breach, which upon thecompletion of the escalation process defined in the SE TLA could not be remedied or (ii) if, eitherparty has a legitimate reason to believe that the reputation of “Siemens” is materially adverselyaffected by the actions of the other party or a third party and the agreed crisis and remediationplan could not be successfully completed.
The SE TLA does not provide for a termination right of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG for the case
that the SGRE TLA is terminated. For the planned discontinuation of the use of the Dresser-Randbrand, which may lead to additional trademark fees towards Siemens AG, see “ 14.1 Formation,
Incorporation, Commercial Register, Name ”.
18.1.1.1.5 Real Estate Lease Agreements
Lease agreements for production, manufacturing, storage, office and other commercial spaces
have been concluded between Siemens Group companies (as landlords) and Siemens Energy
475
Group companies (as tenants) at arm’s length conditions and shall continue to exist after the
Spin-Off Completion. This applies to a total area of approximately 500,000 square meters inapproximately 250 properties worldwide. The total rental expenses of Siemens Energy Group,including operating and ancillary costs as well as the related services under lease agreementswith Siemens Group companies, amount to approximately €107 million annually. It is expected
that the figures for fiscal year 2020 will be slightly higher due to additional spaces for furthertransferred employees from central functions. The most important agreements relate to sites inGermany (in particular located in Berlin and Erlangen).
Furthermore, lease-back agreements have been concluded between Siemens Group companies
(as tenants) and Siemens Energy companies (as landlords) for parts of commercial propertiestransferred to Siemens Energy companies at arm’s length conditions. These lease-backagreements shall also remain in effect after the Spin-Off becomes effective. This relates to a totalarea of approximately 50,000 square meters worldwide. The total rental expenses of SiemensGroup under these lease-back agreements amount to an estimated €7 million in the fiscal year
2020.
Additionally, there are approximately 350,000 square meters in approximately 25 leased locations
worldwide (mostly in Germany) where the respective Landlord has not yet given its consent tothe lease transfer, i.e., such contracts currently remain with Siemens Group companies that
continue to lease to Siemens Energy Group companies. The annual rental costs amount toapproximately €25 million, excluding operating and ancillary costs, which are settled directly
with third party service providers. Negotiations on the respective transfers will continue in thenear future .
18.1.1.1.6 Services
Siemens Group provided Siemens Energy with services relating to human resources, real estate,
IT, IP, legal, compliance, procurement, export control and customs, treasury and corporatefinance, trademark licensing, finance services (including the provision of guarantees and otherforms of security and hedging transactions) and other areas. Siemens Energy was part of the cashpooling and cash management system, group funding, global insurance cover, bank guaranteeand pension management of Siemens Group.
After the Carve-Out of the Siemens Energy business and the Spin-Off Completion, by way of
agreement SE Global GmbH & Co. KG and other companies of Siemens Energy Group shallcontinue to receive certain services from Siemens Group for a transitional period until SiemensEnergy Group has successfully established its own departments and functions (each a “ TSA”). By
way of separate agreement certain services shall be provided on a long-term basis to SiemensEnergy Group via outsourcing (each an “ LSA”). The agreements are conditional upon the
Spin-Off Completion. With some exceptions, they have terms between twelve and 36 months. Intotal, Siemens and Siemens Energy have concluded more than 350 TSAs and more than1,000 LSAs. The expected total contract volumes over the entire term of the contracts areapproximately €280 million for TSAs and approximately €1.2 billion for LSAs. The TSAs
predominantly cover services provided by Siemens’ internal information technology department.All TSAs are governed by the same terms and conditions which provide for certain terminationrights such as termination for cause or if it becomes unlawful for the service provider to performits obligations. As regards the LSAs, approximately 20 are global master agreements concluded bythe central functions in Germany on behalf of Siemens Energy globally. Of the remaining LSAs,around 600 are local adoption agreements based on the global master agreements and theremaining over 400 are independent agreements for specific local country service requirements,for example real estate rental contracts and guarantee facility agreements. The LSAs address awealth of topics, including human resources and accounting, rating, purchasing, sales &marketing support as well as project & transformation management, IT, the “internet of things”,IP, communications, R&D and cybersecurity, patent management and joint purchasing. Asignificant portion of the pension assets in Germany are managed by Siemens Fonds InvestGmbH, which is a 100% (indirect) subsidiary of Siemens AG. For more information on theinsurance of Siemens Energy under Siemens policies until September 30, 2021, see
476
“12.3.13 Insurance ”. Siemens also provides services to Siemens Energy under software as a service
contracts governing the treasury related IT software “finavigate” and “CURRIMA”. For sometopics Siemens Energy may also provide services, among other things in the area of IT, to SiemensAG by means of so called reverse service agreements.
Siemens AG and SE Global GmbH & Co. KG agreed on a general volume discount for service
contracts. For certain specified worldwide services, Siemens AG shall grant a mid double digitpercentage discount on the agreed prices in the first year after the Spin-Off Completion ( i.e.,
presumably until September 25, 2021), a low double digit percentage discount in the second andthird year, thereafter no further discounts shall be granted. The respective discounts shall beapplied in favor of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG and shall be offset against services purchased by SEGlobal GmbH & Co. KG. The above-mentioned contract volumes do not yet include volumediscounts. Finally, upon termination of some of the service agreements, a total of approximately115 job positions, of which around 40 are located in Germany, shall transfer to Siemens Energy.
18.1.1.1.7 Dual Mandates and Similar Relations
As of the date of the Prospectus, all members of the Supervisory Board are employees of Siemens.
Following completion of the Spin-Off, Mr. Joe Kaeser and Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas, who are alsoserving on the executive board of Siemens AG, and Mr. Matthias E. Rebellius, who is an employeeof Siemens, shall be members of the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, Dr. Andrea Fehrmann,Mr. Jürgen Kerner and Mr. Hagen Reimer are expected to remain members of the supervisoryboard of Siemens AG following Spin-Off Completion.
18.1.1.2 Relationships with and Services Provided by the Siemens Group to SGRE
Before the Spin-Off, the relationship between SGRE and the Siemens Group was governed by
numerous agreements which covered general administrative and specific technical matters andservices provided by Siemens, in particular relating to trademark, IP rights, real estate, generaladministration, human resources, customer financing, IT and technical support. The agreementsbelow relate to the relationship between SGRE and the Siemens Group only. SGRE and SiemensGroup continue to have various agreements in place governing their ongoing contractualrelationship, in particular:
18.1.1.2.1 Strategic Supply Agreement SGRE
On March 31, 2017, Gamesa and Siemens Wind HoldCo S.L., as predecessor companies of SGRE
SA, together with Siemens AG, entered into a strategic supply agreement with Siemens AG in thecourse of the merger of SGRE with the wind power business of Siemens AG (the “ Merger ”).
Under this supply agreement, SGRE agreed to purchase from the Siemens Group (as strategicsupplier) specified products and services relating to, in particular, specified gearboxes, segmentsand other products and services, under individual purchase orders or offers, including certainvolume commitments by SGRE for gearboxes and segments. In addition, the agreement entitlesSiemens to provide first quotes (so-called “first calls”) and in certain cases another quote later inthe contracting process (so-called “last calls”), for all or part of SGRE’s external demand forproducts and services that are within the agreement’s scope, all within certain timeframes andsubject to conditions and exceptions and including competitiveness mechanisms. Only thatportion of the agreement relating to the supply of transformers was transferred to SE GlobalGmbH & Co. KG with effect as of January 1, 2020 and has been renegotiated between SE GlobalGmbH & Co. KG and SGRE S.A. The remaining portion of the agreement remains largely in placeand has been updated by an extension and amendment agreement between SGRE S.A. andSiemens AG concluded on May 20, 2020 for the time after the Spin-Off. Pursuant to suchamendment, the agreement remains effective for four years as of the Spin-Off Completion andshall be extended by further consecutive periods of one year unless terminated by either partygiving six-months prior written notice.
477
18.1.1.2.2 Three Party Frame Contract / Collaboration Agreement SGRE
On February 4, 2020, Siemens AG, SGRE S.A. and Iberdrola S.A. concluded a collaboration
agreement (the “ Three Party Frame Contract ”) that was extended on July 9, 2020 until
February 4, 2021, in order to promote the use of onshore and offshore wind energy as well asimprove the distribution grid and generally to promote the use of renewable energy. Inparticular the parties’ objectives under the Three Party Frame Contract are to expand theircurrent business relationships, collaborate in developing projects as well as operating andservicing activities, and to exploit certain specific commercial opportunities. The contract aims tosupport turnover for SGRE and Siemens over the next three to 15 years in exchange forpreferential pricing based on payment terms to be agreed separately and based on general termsand conditions. The Three Party Frame Contract shall be governed by a steering committeeconsisting of three members (one appointed by each of the parties) that supervises thenegotiations among the parties regarding potential projects and execution of specificagreements. For such potential projects, Iberdrola, as a customer of Siemens and SGRE, grantedboth companies exclusive negotiation rights.

Until the Spin-Off Completion, Siemens AG will continue to cooperate with SGRE in a selected
number of financing and treasury fields, such as by maintaining a preferred financingrelationship for customer and sales related financing, leasing or treasury IT-services, and thehedging of certain commodity and currency risk exposure. Following the Spin-Off, Siemens AGwill generally not provide financing, hedging or finance and treasury services to SGRE, with theexception of treasury IT-services and the preferred financing agreement SGRE and Siemens AGwill continue to fulfill its obligations under already existing Securities.
(1) Preferred Financing Agreement SGRE
On March 31, 2017, Gamesa and Siemens Wind HoldCo S.L., as predecessor companies of SGRE
entered into a preferred finance agreement with Siemens AG in the course of the Merger. Thisagreement sets up a preferred financing relationship whereby Siemens AG finances (through itsfinancing entities) SGRE’s clients’ projects on a preferred basis and Siemens’ financial servicesdivision becomes the preferred financing partner of SGRE clients. This agreement will expireupon the Spin-Off Completion and will be replaced by a new preferred financing agreementbetween SGRE S.A. and Siemens AG (“ New Preferred Financing Agreement SGRE ”), entered into
on August 7/13, 2020, effective as of the Spin-Off Completion.
The New Preferred Financing Agreement SGRE comprises a commitment by Siemens to offer,
subject to certain conditions, SFS Financing through its Financing Entities to SGRE’s clients as afirst priority partner with regard to SGRE’s clients’ projects through the provisions of equityfinancing limited to the maximum amount of €200 million per fiscal year for a period of five

principles set out in the agreement, with no less than 60 days’ notice, unless such changes arewithdrawn or the parties reach an agreement with regard to the changed investments principles.
(2) Agreements Relating to Guarantees SGRE
On April 2, 2017, Siemens AG on the one side and Gamesa (later renamed SGRE) and its
subsidiaries on the other side entered into several guarantee facility agreements for existingSecurities (the “ Guarantee Facility Agreements for Existing Guarantees SGRE ”) in connection
with the Merger Agreement, as defined below. Under the Guarantee Facility Agreements forExisting Guarantees SGRE, Siemens AG (or a subsidiary of Siemens AG as issuer of a guarantee), aslender, and SGRE (or the SGRE group company that instructed the issuance of the existingguarantee), as borrower, agreed on the terms and conditions for guarantees that existed on andwere issued, extended, renewed or amended until and excluding the effective date of theMerger ( i.e., April 3, 2017).
Also on April 2, 2017 and in connection with the Merger Agreement, Siemens AG and Gamesa
entered into a guarantee facility agreement for new parent company guarantees and guaranteesapproved according to a special internal approval process established within the Siemens Grouprelating to M&A transactions (“aLoA guarantees”) (the “ New Parent Company Guarantee Facility
Agreement ”). Under the New Parent Guarantee Facility Agreement, Siemens AG provided SGRE
with a guarantee facility in the maximum overall nominal amount of €7.5 billion (the “ Facility ”)
for the new offshore business unit of SGRE, subject to specified maximum annual thresholds. TheFacility only applies to certain guarantees and the aforementioned limit also covers guaranteesthat Siemens issued on a voluntary basis.
The New Parent Company Guarantee Facility Agreement (or any part thereof) became available
as from, but excluding the date on which the Merger became effective and remains in effectuntil the day of the termination of the Facility or respective part thereof in accordance with theterms and conditions of the New Parent Guarantee Facility Agreement, but shall in any event endon December 31, 2020. Any part of the Facility unused at the end of the availability period willbe automatically cancelled. Siemens AG or the relevant subsidiary of Siemens AG that providedthe guarantee may cancel the unutilized part of the overall maximum facility amount withimmediate effect by providing notice to SGRE upon the occurrence of certain cancellation events,including certain events of default and change of control, which occurs if Siemens AG ceases tocontrol SGRE, as defined in the agreement. As defined in the New Parent Guarantee FacilityAgreement, upon the Spin-Off Completion Siemens AG will cease to have control over SGRE.
On May 20, 2020, Siemens AG and SGRE S.A. entered into an amendment agreement to the
Guarantee Facility Agreements for Existing Guarantees SGRE and to the New Parent CompanyGuarantee Facility Agreement each with effect as of the Spin-Off Completion (the “ Amendment
Agreement to the Guarantee Facility Agreements ”). The parties agreed that, upon the Spin-Off
Completion and only as long as (i) SE Global GmbH & Co. KG’s joint and several liability forSGRE’s and its subsidiaries’ obligations in connection with the concerned guarantees is legallyvalid, binding and enforceable and (ii) no third party directly or indirectly acquires control (asdefined in the Amendment Agreement to the Guarantee Facility Agreements) of SGRE (the “ Fee
Reduction Period ”), the previously agreed fees that would be applicable in a spin-off scenario in
accordance with the relevant terms and conditions, shall be reduced. The adapted fees take intoaccount the joint and several liability of SE Global GmbH & Co. KG and are calculated on the basisof the relevant Risk-Adequate Liability Amount, if applicable. In addition, after expiration of theFee Reduction Period and subject to further conditions, SGRE and the concerned subsidiaries maydeduct a certain portion of the fee payments provided by them to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG inrespect of the latter’s joint and several liability from the payment of guarantee fees to Siemens.
For a description of further direct and indirect Securities provided in connection with guarantee
facility agreements entered into among Siemens AG and numerous SGRE companies, for which SEGlobal GmbH & Co. KG has assumed the obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to
479
procure a discharge of such Securities, while at the same assuming joint and several liability
towards Siemens AG for SGRE’s payment obligations, see “ 18.1.1.1.3(1) Securities issued by banks
or the Siemens Group ”.
(3) Agreements Relating to Technical Guarantees SGRE

of the Siemens Group related to several repowering projects in the United States involving taxequity investment from the Siemens Group.
(4) Lease Agreements SGRE
SGRE group companies have in the past and may continue to conclude finance and operating
lease agreements with SFS. The finance leases are used to finance the SGRE group companies,
which are lessees in these leases. These finance leases relate to movable assets, in particularvarious logistics and production equipment and have a term of between three and nine years. Insome cases, the agreements provide for an ordinary right of termination. Operating leases have
been and may continue to be concluded between SGRE group companies and SFS. The operatingleases are leases with short terms to maturity similar to rental agreements. The SGRE groupcompanies act as lessees. The operating leases are for mobile equipment, in particular variouslogistics and production equipment and usually have a term of between one and five years. Someof the agreements provide for an ordinary right of termination.
(5) Hedging Transactions under ISDA Master Agreements SGRE
In connection with the Merger, certain companies of the Siemens Group entered into ISDA
master agreements with certain SGRE group companies. Under these ISDA master agreements,the respective parties entered into currency and commodity price hedging derivatives thatinclude certain representations, events of default and termination events. Additionally, theseagreements include a termination right for the respective member of the Siemens Group uponthe Spin-Off becoming effective, unless the agreements are novated or it is otherwise agreedbetween the relevant parties. In case of a termination, the market values of the derivativetransactions need to be settled between the relevant parties. For more information, see“3.5.2 We may face difficulties in satisfying certain treasury and finance requirements as well as
performing certain services and functions that historically were provided by the Siemens Group. ”
and “ 18.1.2.4.3 Hedging ”. SGRE and the Siemens Group companies may conclude agreements
stipulating that hedging transactions, the expiry date of which falls within a twelve-monthperiod after the Spin-Off Completion, are neither terminated nor novated. Since April 1, 2020,SGRE is entering into derivative positions exclusively with external trading partners while theexisting hedges entered into with Siemens are still with Siemens.
18.1.1.2.4 Trademark License Agreement with SGRE
SGRE S.A. as licensee concluded a trademark and name use (sub-)license agreement with Siemens
AG as licensor on May 20, 2020 (the “ SGRE TLA ”), which will replace an existing agreement with
SGRE S.A. with effect as of Spin-Off Completion. Under the SGRE TLA, Siemens AG continues togrant SGRE the right to, among other things, exclusively use the combined designation “SiemensGamesa” as part of its company name, internet and e-mail domains, and the trademark “SiemensGamesa” for new products, as well as the “SIEMENS” trademark for existing products of theformer Siemens wind power business (the “ SGRE Licensed Designations ”). Under the SGRE TLA,
the right to use the SGRE Licensed Designations is generally limited to business fields in whichSGRE was active prior to its formation in April 2017 but excludes certain Gamesa Electric andGamesa Energy Transmission products and services (the “ SGRE Permitted Activities ”). If SGRE
enters into business fields outside of the SGRE Permitted Activities, it may request Siemens AG toexpand the scope, the consent to such request shall not be unreasonably withheld. However, ifsuch request is denied, SGRE must enter business fields outside the SGRE Permitted Activitiesthrough a separate legal entity that does not have the right to use the SGRE LicensedDesignations.
480
The SGRE TLA has an initial term of ten years and extends automatically unless terminated by
either party can be extended. Siemens AG has the right to terminate the SGRE TLA withimmediate effect subject to staggered transition periods and with prior notice in a number ofinstances, such as, if (i) the SE TLA is terminated, (ii) Siemens Energy loses control over SGRE S.A.,(iii) SGRE S.A. stops using the designation “Siemens” as part of its company name, (iv) Siemenshas a legitimate reason to believe that the reputation of “Siemens” is materially adverselyaffected, even where this is due to a situation beyond SGRE’s control, (v) SGRE fails to establishand maintain certain best industry practices defined in the SGRE TLA, or (vi) SGRE materiallybreaches the SGRE TLA and such breach is not remedied. No license fee is payable under the SGRETLA.

certain services to SGRE in the form of transitional services, including, among others, IT, taxservices, human resources, and to a very limited extent treasury related IT-services (treasurysoftware “finavigate” that might be used not only for a transitional period).
For example, pursuant to transitional service agreements entered into by Siemens AG and
Siemens Wind Power GmbH & Co. KG, later renamed as Siemens Gamesa Renewable EnergyGmbH & Co. KG (a subsidiary of SGRE S.A.) with effect as of December 1, 2016, Siemens AGagreed to provide certain services including accounting, IT, human resources or tax services, for a
481
service charge to be calculated as further detailed in the agreement, whereby the scope of the
services and associated service charges may be modified from time to time by written agreementamong the parties. The agreement contemplates a possible extension of its effectiveness afterSiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy GmbH & Co. KG, as service recipient, ceases to be a subsidiaryof Siemens AG. Among other termination grounds ( e.g., termination for or without cause), the
agreement contemplates a termination right for Siemens AG in the event of a second change ofcontrol. The transitional service agreements were extended and will end on March 2021 by virtueof an amendment agreement to the Merger Agreement.
With effect as of August 1, 2019, SGRE S.A. and Siemens AG entered into a service agreement

agreement (subsequently amended) by which Siemens provides procurement services enablingSGRE to benefit from a collective bargaining power in the pooling of such procurement services.The scope of the procurement services, as further detailed in the agreement, encompasses targets(e.g., saving targets) as well as service charges. Siemens AG’s compensation under the agreement
varies depending on the type of service, some are subject to a fixed compensation with monthlyinstallments and others are based on usage. The compensation may be adjusted in case the actualsavings and certain specified synergies fall below the joint estimation set forth in the agreement.The agreement serves as a framework agreement to specify the terms and conditions for theprovision of procurement services by Siemens AG to SGRE S.A. and its affiliates, but the renderingof services are regulated in specific adoption agreements.
(3) Service Agreement on the Administration of IP-Related Matters SGRE
With effect as of January 1, 2019, SGRE and Siemens AG entered into a framework service

18.1.2.4.6 Transactions between the Siemens Group and SGRE
(1) Merger AgreementOn June 17, 2016, Gamesa and Siemens AG signed a binding merger agreement (the “ Merger
Agreement ”) whereby both parties agreed on the terms and conditions pursuant to which
Gamesa and Siemens’ wind power business (as defined in the agreement) would be combined byway of statutory merger by absorption of Siemens Wind HoldCo S.L (as absorbed entity) by andinto Gamesa (as absorbing entity), with the dissolution without liquidation of the former and theen bloc transfer of all of its assets and liabilities to the latter, which would acquire by universal
succession all of the rights and obligations of Siemens Wind HoldCo S.L. On March 17, 2017, theparties signed an addendum to the Merger Agreement regarding, among other issues, theprocess for the identification and agreement of services provided prior to the Merger’s effectivedate on the basis of transitional service contracts or other contracts by any company of theSiemens Group to the SGRE S.A. subsidiaries that prior to the Merger belonged to Siemens’ windpower business materially in the same form as prior to the Merger.
The Merger had its effective date on April 3, 2017. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Siemens
AG acquired 59% of the shares in Gamesa in exchange for 100% of its wind power business andpaid an extraordinary merger dividend of approximately €999 million in cash which was
distributed to the Gamesa shareholders (without Siemens AG) following the completion of themerger. The consideration transferred by Siemens AG equaled 59% of Gamesa’s marketcapitalization at closing of the merger and amounted to €3,669 million. In connection with the
merger, many other agreements were entered into, including the Strategic Alliance AgreementSGRE (see “ 18.1.1.2.9 Agreements that will be terminated upon the Spin-Off Completion ”) and
further agreements entered into thereunder.
(2) Platform Cooperation Agreement
On March 31, 2017, Siemens AG and Gamesa, which was subsequently renamed SGRE, entered
into a cooperation agreement entitled “Platform Cooperation Agreement”. Under thisagreement, the parties set up a specific committee made up of nominees of both parties toensure that each party identified suitable personnel to investigate, identify and agree ways toenhance the parties’ business in areas in which SGRE’s products and services can be combinedwith certain Siemens services regarding data analysis using solutions and platforms operated bySiemens, such as “MindSphere” (Siemens’ cloud-based “internet of things” open operatingsystem) or other platform solutions to achieve a marketable high-value product or service orwhere a cooperation can be beneficial for both parties’ business, among other tasks. Theidentified joint development team acts as a central point of contact between the parties forsupporting the organization of joint bid teams in cases where a commercial opportunity thatwould benefit both parties is identified and for developing other joint collaboration projects.Moreover, the parties agreed that any IP rights and know-how resulting from any collaborationunder the agreement shall be owned by the Siemens Group, and that the scope of SGRE’s userights and any royalty payments shall be agreed and specified in relevant individual agreements.However, any applications solely developed by SGRE based on “MindSphere” shall be owned bySGRE, and applications jointly developed by SGRE and Siemens based on “MindSphere” andother specified jointly-developed IP rights and know-how shall be regulated on a case-by-casebasis. The agreement had an initial term of three years from the date of closing of the Merger(i.e., until April 3, 2020) and was subject to certain extension periods unless terminated on
six-months prior notice by either party. The agreement was terminated by SGRE S.A., with effectas of April 3, 2020 and has not been replaced by a similar agreement as of the date of thisProspectus. There are no remaining collaborations, activities or projects that survived thetermination
(3) Clearing Accounts
In order to simplify and consolidate the settlement of payment claims relating to the provision of
goods and services between the Siemens Group and SGRE, clearing accounts in different
487
currencies were created at the level of Siemens AG and SGRE S.A. The respective balances on
these clearing accounts are due with a term of 60 or 90 days and must be settled in accordancewith the netting and settlement agreement entered into between Siemens AG and SGRE. WithSpin-Off Completion, this process shall be terminated and future balances shall be settled inaccordance with terms and conditions of the relevant supply and service agreements, i.e., directly
between the companies concerned.

19 TAXATION OF SHAREHOLDERS IN GERMANY
The tax laws of any jurisdiction with authority to impose taxes on the Company’s shareholders
and the tax laws of the Company’s country of incorporation (i.e., Germany) may have animpact on the income received from the Shares.
The following section presents a number of key German taxation principles which generally are
or can be relevant to the acquisition, holding or transfer of shares both by a shareholder (anindividual, a partnership or corporation) that has a tax domicile in Germany (that is, whose placeof residence, habitual abode, registered office or place of management is in Germany) and by ashareholder without a tax domicile in Germany. However, it does not address the taxconsequences for the shareholders of Siemens AG that arise in connection with the Spin-Off. Theinformation is not exhaustive and does not constitute a definitive explanation of all possibleaspects of taxation that could be relevant for shareholders. The information is based on the taxlaws in force in Germany as of the date of the Prospectus (and their interpretation byadministrative directives and courts) as well as typical provisions of double taxation treaties thatGermany has concluded with other countries. Tax law can change – sometimes retrospectively.Moreover, it cannot be ruled out that the German tax authorities or courts may consider analternative interpretation or application to be correct that differs from the one described in thissection.
This section cannot serve as a substitute for tailored tax advice to individual shareholders.
Shareholders are therefore advised to consult their tax advisers regarding the tax implications ofthe acquisition, holding or transfer of shares and regarding the procedures to be followed toachieve a possible reimbursement of German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer). Only suchadvisers are in a position to take the specific tax-relevant circumstances of individualshareholders into due account.
19.1 Income Tax Implications of the Holding, Sale and Transfer of Shares
In terms of the taxation of shareholders of the Company, a distinction must be made betweentaxation in connection with the holding of shares (“ 19.2 Taxation of Dividends ”) and taxation in
connection with the sale of shares (“ 19.3 Taxation of Capital Gains ”) and taxation in connection
with the gratuitous transfer of shares (“ 19.5 Inheritance and Gift Tax ”).
19.2 Taxation of Dividends
19.2.1 Withholding Tax
As a general rule, dividends distributed to the shareholder are subject to a withholding tax
(Kapitalertragsteuer ) of 25.0% and a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon ( i.e., 26.375% in total
plus church tax, if applicable). This, however, will not apply if and to the extent that dividendpayments are funded from the Company’s contribution account for tax purposes ( steuerliches
Einlagekonto; § 27 Körperschaftsteuergesetz ,“KStG ”); in this case no withholding tax will be
withheld. However, these payments will reduce the acquisition costs of the shares and may,consequently, result in or increase a taxable gain upon the disposal of the shares (see below at“19.3 Taxation of Capital Gains ”). The assessment basis for the withholding tax is the dividend
approved by the general shareholders’ meeting.
If shares – as it is the case with the shares in the Company – are admitted for collective custody by
a central securities depository ( Wertpapiersammelbank ) pursuant to Section 5 German Act on
Securities Accounts ( Depotgesetz ) and are entrusted to such bank for collective custody
(Sammelverwahrung ) in Germany, the withholding tax is withheld and passed on for the account
of the shareholders (i) by the domestic credit or financial services institution ( inländisches Kredit-
oder Finanzdienstleistungsinstitut ) (including domestic branches of such foreign enterprises), by
the domestic securities trading company ( inländisches Wertpapierhandelsunternehmen ) or by the
domestic securities trading bank ( inländische Wertpapierhandelsbank ) which keeps or
administers the shares and disburses or credits the dividends to the shareholder or disburses the
490
dividends to a foreign agent, (ii) by the central securities depository ( Wertpapiersammelbank )t o
which the shares were entrusted for collective custody if the dividends are disbursed to a foreignagent by such central securities depository ( Wertpapiersammelbank ) or (iii) by the Company itself
if and to the extent shares held in collective custody ( Sammelverwahrung ) by the central
securities depository ( Wertpapiersammelbank ) are treated as so-called “ abgesetzte Bestände ”
(stock being held separately) (hereinafter in all cases, the “ Dividend Paying Agent ”). Aside from
the case of stock being held separately, the Company does not assume any responsibility for thewithholding of the withholding tax.
In general, the withholding tax must be withheld without regard as to whether and to what
extent the dividend is exempt from (corporate) income tax at the level of the shareholder andwhether the shareholder is domiciled in Germany or abroad.
However, withholding tax on dividends distributed to a company domiciled in another EU
Member State within the meaning of Article 2 of the Council Directive 2011/96/EU ofNovember 30, 2011, as amended (“ Parent-Subsidiary Directive ”), may be refunded upon
application and subject to further conditions. This also applies to dividends distributed to apermanent establishment of such a parent company in another EU Member State or to a parentcompany that is subject to unlimited tax liability in Germany, provided that the participation inthe Company is actually part of such permanent establishment’s business assets. Furtherrequirements for the refund of withholding tax under the Parent-Subsidiary Directive are thatthe shareholder has directly held at least 10.0% of the Company’s registered share capitalcontinuously for one year and that a respective application is filed with the German FederalCentral Tax Office ( Bundeszentralamt für Steuern, Hauptdienstsitz Bonn-Beuel , An der Küppe 1,
D-53225 Bonn, Germany). If, in the case of a holding of at least 10.0% of the Company’sregistered share capital, shares held in collective custody ( Sammelverwahrung ) by the German
central securities depository ( Wertpapiersammelbank ) Clearstream Banking AG are treated as
so-called “ abgesetzte Bestände ” (stock being held separately), the German tax authorities will
not object when the main paying agent ( Hauptzahlstelle ) of the Company upon presentation of
a valid exemption certificate ( Freistellungsbescheinigung ) and of a proof that this stock has been
held separately, disburses the dividend without deducting withholding tax. An exemptioncertificate can be granted upon application (using official application forms) with the GermanFederal Central Tax Office ( Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) (at the above address).
With respect to distributions made to shareholders not tax resident in Germany, the withholding
tax may be at least partially refunded in accordance with an applicable double taxation treatyGermany has entered into with the respective shareholder’s country of residence if the sharesneither form part of the assets of a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business inGermany, nor form part of business assets for which a permanent representative in Germany hasbeen appointed. The withholding tax refund is generally granted by the German Federal CentralTax Office (at the above address) upon application in such a manner that the difference betweenthe total amount withheld, including the solidarity surcharge, and the reduced withholding taxactually owed under the relevant double taxation treaty (generally 15.0%) is refunded by theGerman Federal Central Tax Office. A refund is not required if the Federal Central Tax Office has,upon application on the officially prescribed form, issued an exemption certificate(Freistellungsbescheinigung ) which documents that the prerequisites for the application of the
reduced withholding tax rates have been met. Dividends covered by the exemption certificate ofthe shareholder are then only subject to the reduced withholding tax rates stipulated in theexemption certificate.
Forms for the reimbursement and the exemption from the withholding at source procedure are
available at the German Federal Central Tax Office (at the above address or online at h t t ps://w w w.bzst.de).
If dividends are distributed to corporations subject to non-resident taxation in Germany, i.e.,
corporations with no registered office or place of management in Germany and if the sharesneither belong to the assets of a permanent establishment or fixed place of business in Germanynor are part of business assets for which a permanent representative in Germany has been
491
appointed, two-fifths of the tax withheld at the source can generally be refunded even if not all
of the prerequisites for a refund under the Parent-Subsidiary Directive or an applicable doubletaxation treaty are fulfilled. The relevant application forms are available at the German FederalCentral Tax Office (at the above address).
The aforementioned possibilities for an exemption from or a refund of withholding tax depend
on certain other conditions being met (particularly the fulfillment of so-called “substancerequirements” – Substanzerfordernisse ).
Pursuant to a special rule, the aforementioned withholding tax reliefs as well as the credit of
withholding tax described in the section “ 19.2.2 Taxation of Dividends of Shareholders with a Tax
Domicile in Germany ” below for shares held as non-business and as business assets will only be
granted if the shareholder (i) has been the economic owner of the shares for a continuous periodof at least 45 days during the period starting 45 days prior to the date when the dividendbecomes due and ending 45 days after such date (the “ Minimum Holding Period ”
(Mindesthaltedauer )), (ii) has been exposed (if taking into account claims of the shareholder from
transactions reducing the risk of changes of the market value of the shares and correspondingclaims of related parties of the shareholder) to at least 70.0% of the risk resulting from adecrease-in-value of the shares continuously during the Minimum Holding Period (the minimumchange-in-value risk ( Mindestwertänderungsrisiko )) and (iii) is not obliged to forward ( vergüten )
these dividends, directly or indirectly, in total or to more than 50.0% to another person.
In the event that a shareholder tax resident in Germany does not meet the aforementioned three
requirements, three fifths of the withholding tax levied on the dividends ( i.e., 15.0% of the
dividends) is not creditable, but may, upon application, be deducted when determining theshareholder’s taxable income in an assessment procedure. Shareholders who do not meet therequirements but who have, nevertheless, not suffered a withholding tax deduction on thedividends (for example, due to the presentation of a non-assessment certificate) or have alreadyobtained a refund of the taxes withheld, are obliged to notify their competent tax office thereofand to make the payment of an amount corresponding to the amount which would otherwise bewithheld; pursuant to the law regarding tax incentives for electric mobility and the amendmentof further tax regulations ( Gesetz zur weiteren steuerlichen Förderung der Elektromobilität und
zur Änderung weiterer steuerlicher Vorschriften ) that came into force on December 18, 2019, this
amount will be equal to 15.0% of the dividends from January 1, 2019 onwards. The special ruleon the restriction of withholding tax credit does not apply to a shareholder if either (i) his or heramount of dividend income on shares (including shares of the Company) and certain profitparticipation rights ( Genussrechte ) does not exceed an amount of €20,000 in a given tax
assessment period or if (ii) he or she has been, upon actual receipt of the dividend, the economicowner of the shares for a continuous period of at least one year, whereby shares of theshareholder acquired first are deemed to be sold first (first in – first out).
In the event that a shareholder not tax resident in Germany does not meet the aforementioned
three requirements, a refund of the withholding tax pursuant to a double taxation treaty is notavailable. This restriction only applies if (i) the applicable double taxation treaty provides for atax reduction leading to an applicable tax rate of less than 15.0%, (ii) the shareholder is not acorporation that directly holds at least a participation of 10.0% of the equity capital of theCompany and is subject to tax on its income and profits in its state of residence without beingexempt and (iii) the shareholder has not been, upon actual receipt of the dividend, the economicowner of the shares for a continuous period of at least one year, whereby shares of theshareholder acquired first are deemed to be sold first (first in – first out).
The Dividend Paying Agent which keeps or administrates the shares and pays or credits the
capital income is required to create so-called “pots for offsetting losses”(Verlustverrechnungstöpfe ) to allow for negative capital income to be set off against current and
future positive capital income. A set off of negative capital income at one Dividend Paying Agentagainst positive capital income at another Dividend Paying Agent is only possible in the course ofthe income tax assessment at the level of the respective shareholder. In such case the relevantshareholder has to apply for a certificate confirming the amount of losses not offset with the
492
Dividend Paying Agent where the pot for offsetting losses exists. The application is irrevocable
and must reach the Dividend Paying Agent until December 15 of the respective year, as otherwisethe losses will be carried forward by the respective Dividend Paying Agent to the following year.
Withholding tax will not be withheld by a Dividend Paying Agent if the shareholder provides
such Dividend Paying Agent with an application for exemption ( Freistellungsauftrag ) to the
extent such shareholder’s capital income does not exceed the annual lump-sum deduction(Sparer-Pauschbetrag )o f€801 (€1,602 for married couples and registered partners jointly
assessed) as outlined on the application for exemption. Furthermore, no withholding tax will belevied if the shareholder provides the Dividend Paying Agent with a non-assessment certificate(Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung ) to be applied for with the competent tax office.
19.2.2 Taxation of Dividends of Shareholders with a Tax Domicile in Germany
This section applies to shareholders with a tax domicile in Germany ( i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control islocated in Germany).
19.2.2.1 Shares Held as Non-Business AssetsDividends distributed to shareholders with a tax domicile in Germany whose shares are held as
non-business assets form part of their taxable capital investment income, which is subject to aspecial uniform income tax rate of 25.0% plus solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon ( i.e., 26.375%
in total plus church tax, if applicable). The income tax owed for this dividend income is generallysatisfied by the withholding tax withheld by the Dividend Paying Agent (flat-rate withholdingtax ( Abgeltungsteuer )). Income-related expenses cannot be deducted from the shareholder’s
capital investment income (including dividends), except for an annual lump-sum deduction(Sparer -Pauschbetrag )o f€801 (€1,602 for married couples and registered partners jointly
assessed). However, the shareholder may request that his capital investment income (includingdividends) along with his other taxable income be subject to a progressive income tax rate(instead of the uniform tax rate for capital investment income) if this results in a lower taxburden. In this case, income-related expenses cannot be deducted from the capital investmentincome, except for the aforementioned annual lump-sum deduction.
If the withholding tax deduction does not satisfy ( abgelten ) the tax liability of the shareholder,
the withholding tax will generally be credited against the progressive income tax and any excessamount will be refunded if the requirements of the special rule on the restriction of withholdingtax credit (see above “ 19.2.1 Withholding Tax ”) are fulfilled.
Exceptions from the flat-rate withholding tax also apply upon application for shareholders who
have a shareholding of at least 25.0% in the Company and for shareholders who have ashareholding of at least 1.0% in the Company and are able to entrepreneurially influence thebusiness activities of the company through a professional work for the Company. In thissituation, the tax treatment described below at “ 19.2.2.2.2 Sole Proprietors ”) applies.
For taxpayers, subject to church tax, such tax will be withheld by way of an automated procedure
and remitted to the religious community levying the tax. Church tax withheld at source may notbe deducted as a special expense ( Sonderausgabe ) in the course of the tax assessment, but the
Dividend Paying Agent may reduce the standard withholding tax rate (including the solidaritysurcharge of 26.375%) by the church tax to be withheld on the dividends. Where shareholdershave lodged a timely written objection with the German Federal Central Tax Office(Bundeszentralamt für Steuern (at the above address)) (so-called “blocking notice” –
Sperrvermerk ) as regards the automated retrieval of data on their religious affiliation, church tax
will not be automatically deducted. In this case, a shareholder subject to church tax is obliged todeclare the dividends in his income tax return. The church tax on the dividends is then levied byway of a tax assessment.
Shareholders who are subject to German tax residents’ taxation and hold their shares as
non-business assets may be paid the dividends without deduction of withholding tax if certain
493
prerequisites are met, in particular, if the shareholder has provided a non-assessment certificate
(Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung ) or an exemption instruction ( Freistellungsauftrag ) and the
exempt amount indicated therein has not yet been exhausted.
As an exemption, dividend payments that are funded from the Company’s contribution account
for tax purposes ( steuerliches Einlagekonto; § 27 KStG ) and are paid to shareholders with a tax
domicile in Germany whose shares are held as non-business assets, do – contrary to the above –not form part of the shareholder’s taxable income but reduce the acquisition costs for theunderlying shares. This results in a higher capital gain in the event of the shares’ disposal (seebelow at “ 19.3 Taxation of Capital Gains ”). However, this will not apply if (i) the shareholder or,
in the event of a gratuitous transfer, its legal predecessor, or, if the shares have been gratuitouslytransferred several times in succession, one of his legal predecessors at any point during the fiveyears preceding the (deemed, as the case may be,) disposal directly or indirectly held at least1.0% of the share capital of the Company (a “ Qualified Holding ”) and (ii) the dividend payment
funded from the Company’s contribution account for tax purposes exceeds the actual acquisitioncosts of the shares. In such a case of a Qualified Holding, a dividend payment funded from theCompany’s contribution account for tax purposes is deemed a sale of the shares and is taxable asa capital gain if and to the extent the dividend payment funded from the Company’scontribution account for tax purposes exceeds the acquisition costs of the shares. In this case thetaxation corresponds with the description in the section “ 19.3.1.1 Shares Held as Non-Business
Assets ” made with regard to shareholders maintaining a Qualified Holding.
19.2.2.2 Shares Held as Business Assets
Dividends from shares held as business assets of a shareholder with a tax domicile in Germany are
not subject to the flat-rate withholding tax. However, dividends are generally subject to thewithholding tax on capital investment income of 25.0% plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge thereon,resulting in an aggregate tax rate of 26.375%, plus church tax for individuals, if applicable. Thewithholding tax (including the solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable) withheld andpaid by the Dividend Paying Agent will generally be credited against the shareholder’s income orcorporate income tax liability (including the solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable) orrefunded in the amount of any excess if the requirements of the special rule on the restriction ofwithholding tax credit (see above “ 19.2.1 Withholding Tax ”) are fulfilled. The taxation depends
on whether the shareholder is a corporation, a sole proprietor or a partnership(co-entrepreneurship).
Dividend payments that are funded from the Company’s contribution account for tax purposes
(steuerliches Einlagekonto; § 27 KStG ) and are paid to shareholders with a tax domicile in
Germany whose shares are held as business assets, are generally fully tax-exempt in the hands ofsuch shareholder but reduce the acquisition costs for the underlying shares. To the extent thedividend payments funded from the Company’s contribution account for tax purposes exceed theactual acquisition costs of the shares, a taxable capital gain occurs. The taxation of such gaincorresponds with the description in the section “ 19.3.1.2 Shares Held as Business Assets ” made
with regard to shareholders whose shares are held as business assets.
19.2.2.2.1 Corporations
If the shareholder is a corporation with a tax domicile in Germany, the dividends are in general
effectively 95.0% exempt from corporate income tax and the solidarity surcharge. 5.0% of thedividends are treated as non-deductible business expenses and are therefore subject to corporateincome tax (plus the solidarity surcharge) at a total tax rate of 15.825%. Business expensesactually incurred in direct relation to the dividends may be deducted. However, dividends are notexempt from corporate income tax (including solidarity surcharge thereon), if the shareholderonly holds a direct participation of less than 10.0% in the Company’s registered share capital atthe beginning of the calendar year (“ Portfolio Participation ”– Streubesitzbeteiligung ).
Participations of at least 10.0% acquired during a calendar year are deemed to have beenacquired at the beginning of the calendar year. Participations which a shareholder holds through
494
a partnership (including those that are co-entrepreneurships ( Mitunternehmerschaften )) are
attributable to the shareholder only on a pro rata basis at the ratio of the interest share of the
shareholder in the assets of the relevant partnership.
Dividends (after deducting business expenses economically related to the dividends) are subject
to trade tax in the full amount, unless the shareholder held at least 15.0% of the Company’sregistered share capital at the beginning of the relevant tax assessment period. In the latter case,the dividends are not subject to trade tax; however, trade tax is levied on the amount consideredto be a non-deductible business expense (amounting to 5.0% of the dividend). Trade tax dependson the municipal trade tax multiplier applied by the relevant municipal authority.
Special rules apply to dividends received by companies active in the financial and insurance
sectors, as well as pension funds (see below “ 19.4 Special Treatment of Companies in the
Financial and Insurance Sectors and Pension Funds ”).
19.2.2.2.2 Sole Proprietors
If the shares are held as business assets by a sole proprietor with a tax domicile in Germany, only
60.0% of the dividends are subject to a progressive income tax (plus the solidarity surcharge) at atotal tax rate of up to approximately 47.5%, known as the partial income method(Teileinkünfteverfahren ). The partial income method does not apply with respect to church tax (if
applicable). Only 60.0% of the business expenses economically related to the dividends aretax-deductible. If the shares belong to a domestic permanent establishment in Germany of abusiness operation of the shareholder, the dividend income (after deducting business expenseseconomically related thereto) is not only subject to income tax but is also fully subject to tradetax, unless the shareholder held at least 15.0% of the Company’s registered share capital at thebeginning of the relevant tax assessment period. In this latter case, the net amount of dividends,i.e., after deducting directly related expenses, is exempt from trade tax. As a rule, trade tax can
be credited against the shareholder’s personal income tax, either in full or in part, by means of alump-sum tax credit method, depending on the level of the municipal trade tax multiplier andcertain individual tax-relevant circumstances of the taxpayer.
19.2.2.2.3 Partnerships
If the shareholder is a partnership with a tax domicile in Germany, the income or corporate
income tax, as the case may be, and the solidarity surcharge are not levied at the level of thepartnership but at the level of the respective partner. The taxation for every partner depends onwhether the partner is a corporation or an individual. If the partner is a corporation, thedividends contained in the profit share of the shareholder will be taxed in accordance with theprinciples applicable for corporations (see “ 19.2.2.2.1 Corporations ” above). If the partner is an
individual, the taxation is in line with the principles described for sole proprietors (see“19.2.2.2.2 Sole Proprietors ” above). Upon application and subject to further conditions, an
individual as a partner can have his personal income tax rate lowered for earnings not withdrawnfrom the partnership.
In addition, the dividends are generally subject to trade tax in the full amount at the level of a
commercial or deemed commercial partnership if the shares are attributed to a Germanpermanent establishment of the partnership. If a partner of the partnership is an individual, theportion of the trade tax paid by the partnership pertaining to his profit share will generally becredited, either in full or in part, against his personal income tax by means of a lump-summethod – depending on the level of the municipal trade tax multiplier and certain individualtax-relevant circumstances of the taxpayer. If the partnership held at least 15% of the Company’sregistered share capital at the beginning of the relevant tax assessment period, the dividends(after deduction of business expenses economically related thereto) should generally not besubject to trade tax. In this case, trade tax should, however, be levied on 5% of the dividends tothe extent they are attributable to the profit share of a corporate partner to whom at least 10%of the shares in the Company are attributable on a look-through basis, since this portion of thedividends should be deemed to be non-deductible business expenses. The remaining portion of
495
the dividend income attributable to partners other than such specific corporate partners (which
includes individual partners and should, according to a literal reading of the law, also includecorporate partners to whom, on a look-through basis, only Portfolio Participations areattributable) should not be subject to trade tax. Due to a lack of case law and administrativeguidance, the exact application of the rules for the taxation of dividends from PortfolioParticipations (see “ 19.2.2.2.1 Corporations ” above) is, however, unclear. Shareholders are
strongly recommended to consult their tax advisers.
19.2.3 Taxation of Dividends of Shareholders with a Non-German Tax Domicile
Shareholders without a tax domicile in Germany, whose shares are attributable to a German
permanent establishment or fixed place of business or are part of business assets for which apermanent representative in Germany has been appointed, are liable for tax in Germany on theirdividend income. In this respect the provisions outlined above for shareholders with a taxdomicile in Germany whose shares are held as business assets apply accordingly (see“19.2.2.2 Shares Held as Business Assets ”). The withholding tax (including the solidarity
surcharge) withheld and passed on will generally be credited against the income or corporateincome tax liability or refunded in the amount of any excess if the requirements of the specialrule on the restriction of withholding tax credit (see above “ 19.2.1 Withholding Tax ”) are
fulfilled.
In all other cases, any tax liability in Germany for dividends received by shareholders resident
outside of Germany will be discharged through the withholding of the withholding tax by theDividend Paying Agent. A refund or exemption is granted only as discussed under“19.2.1 Withholding Tax ” above.
Dividend payments that are funded from the Company’s contribution account for tax purposes
(steuerliches Einlagekonto; § 27 KStG ) are generally not subject to German taxation.
19.3 Taxation of Capital Gains
19.3.1 Taxation of Capital Gains of Shareholders with a Tax Domicile in Germany
This section applies to shareholders with a tax domicile in Germany ( i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control islocated in Germany).
19.3.1.1 Shares Held as Non-Business Assets
Gains on the disposal of shares acquired after December 31, 2008 by a shareholder with a tax
domicile in Germany and held as non-business assets are generally – regardless of the holdingperiod – subject to a uniform tax rate on capital investment income in Germany (25.0% plus thesolidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon, i.e., 26.375% in total plus any church tax, if applicable).
The taxable capital gain is equal to the difference between (a) the proceeds of the disposal and
(b) the acquisition costs of the shares plus the expenses related directly and materially to thedisposal. Dividend payments that are funded from the Company’s contribution account for taxpurposes ( steuerliches Einlagekonto; § 27 KStG ) reduce the original acquisition costs; if dividend
payments that are funded from the Company’s contribution account for tax purposes exceed theacquisition costs, negative acquisition costs – which can increase a capital gain – can arise in caseof shareholders, whose shares are held as non-business assets and do not qualify as a QualifiedHolding.
Only an annual lump-sum deduction of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and registered
partners jointly assessed) may be deducted from the entire capital investments income. It isgenerally not possible to deduct income-related expenses in connection with capital gains, exceptfor the expenses directly related in substance to the disposal which can be deducted whencalculating the capital gains. Losses from the disposal of shares may only be offset against profitsfrom capital investments arising from the disposal of the Company’s shares or other shares instock corporations during the same assessment period or in future assessment periods.
496
Furthermore, in case of a derecognition or transfer of worthless shares (or other capital assets),
the utilization of such loss is further restricted and can only be offset up to the amount of€10,000 per calendar year.
If the shares are held in custody or administered by a domestic credit or financial services
institution, domestic securities trading company or a domestic securities trading bank, includingdomestic branches of foreign credit institutions or financial service institutions, or if such anoffice executes the disposal of the shares and pays out or credits the capital gains (each a“Domestic Paying Agent ”), the tax on the capital gains will generally be satisfied by the
Domestic Paying Agent withholding the withholding tax on investment income in the amount of26.375% (including the solidarity surcharge) on the capital gain and transferring it to the taxauthority for the account of the seller. If the shares were held in custody or administered by therespective Domestic Paying Agent continuously after acquisition, the amount of tax withheld isgenerally based on the difference between the proceeds from the sale, after deducting expensesdirectly related to the sale, and the amount paid to acquire the shares. However, the withholdingtax rate of 25.0% plus the 5.5% solidarity surcharge thereon and any church tax (if applicable),will be applied to 30.0% of the gross sales proceeds if the shares were not administered by thesame custodian bank since acquisition and the original cost of the shares cannot be verified orsuch verification is not admissible. In this case, the shareholder is entitled to, and in case theactual gain is higher than 30% of the gross proceeds must, verify the original costs of the sharesin his or her annual income tax return.
The church tax deduction for capital gains is performed by way of standardized tax withholding
procedure by the Domestic Paying Agent withholding such tax. The principles outlined above forchurch tax on dividend income (see “ 19.2.2.1 Shares Held as Non-Business Assets ” above) apply
accordingly.
The shareholder can apply for his total capital investment income, together with his other
taxable income, to be subject to a progressive income tax rate as opposed to the uniform tax rateon investment income, if this results in a lower tax liability. In this case, the withholding tax iscredited against the progressive income tax and any resulting excess amount will be refunded.Limitations on offsetting losses are applicable. Further, income-related expenses arenon-deductible, except for the annual lump-sum deduction.
Shareholders who are subject to German residents’ taxation and hold their shares as non-business
assets may realize capital gains without deduction of tax on capital investment income andsolidarity surcharge if certain prerequisites are met, particularly if the shareholder has provided anon-assessment certificate ( Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung ) or an exemption instruction
(Freistellungsauftrag ) and the exempt amount indicated therein has not yet been exhausted.
If the withholding tax or, if applicable, the church tax on capital gains is not withheld by a
Domestic Paying Agent, the shareholder is required to declare the capital gains in his income taxreturn. The income tax and any applicable church tax on the capital gains will then be collectedby way of assessment.
In case of a Qualified Holding, the capital gain deriving from the disposal of the shares is not
subject to the flat-rate withholding tax, but to the progressive income tax regime. In this case thepartial income method applies to gains on the disposal of shares, which means that only 60.0%of the capital gains are subject to tax and only 60.0% of the losses on the disposal and expenseseconomically related thereto are tax deductible. Even though withholding tax is withheld by aDomestic Paying Agent in the case of a Qualified Holding, this does not satisfy the tax liability ofthe shareholder. Consequently, a shareholder must declare his capital gains in his income taxreturns. The withholding tax (including the solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable)withheld and paid will be credited against the shareholder’s income tax liability on his taxassessment (including the solidarity surcharge and any church tax if applicable) or refunded inthe amount of any excess.
497
19.3.1.2 Shares Held as Business Assets
Gains on the sale of shares held as business assets of a shareholder with a tax domicile in
Germany are not subject to a uniform withholding tax. Withholding tax may only be withheld ifthe shares are kept with a Domestic Paying Agent. Subject to certain prerequisites, the tax oncapital investment income withheld and remitted to the tax authorities will be imputed towardsthe shareholder’s income tax liability and any excess amount paid will be refunded. Subject tocertain requirements, however, the Domestic Paying Agent may refrain from deducting tax oncapital investment income if (i) the shareholder is a corporation subject to German residentstaxation, an association of individuals or an estate or (ii) the shares form part of the businessassets of a business operation in Germany and the shareholders declare such to the DomesticPaying Agent in the officially prescribed form. Should the Domestic Paying Agent nonethelesshave withheld tax on capital investment income, the tax withheld and remitted to the taxauthorities (including solidarity surcharge, and church tax, if applicable) will be credited againstthe shareholder’s personal income tax or corporate income tax liability and any excess amountpaid will be refunded.
The taxation of the capital gains depends on whether the shareholder is a corporation, a sole
proprietor or a partnership (co-entrepreneurship). Dividend payments that are funded from theCompany’s contribution account for tax purposes ( steuerliches Einlagekonto; § 27 KStG ) reduce
the original acquisition costs. In the event of disposal, a higher taxable capital gain can arisetherefrom. If the dividend payments exceed the shares’ book value for tax purposes, a taxablecapital gain can arise.
19.3.1.2.1 Corporations
If the shareholder is a corporation with a tax domicile in Germany, the gains on the disposal of
shares are, in general, effectively 95.0% exempt from corporate income tax (including thesolidarity surcharge) and trade tax, regardless of the size of the participation and the holdingperiod. 5.0% of the gains are treated as non-deductible business expenses and are thereforesubject to corporate income tax (plus the solidarity surcharge) at a tax rate amounting to15.825% and trade tax (depending on the municipal trade tax multiplier applied by therespective municipal authority). As a rule, losses on disposals and other profit reductions inconnection with shares (for example ,from a write-down) cannot be deducted as business
expenses.
Special rules apply to capital gains realized by companies active in the financial and insurance
sectors, as well as pension funds (see below “ 19.4 Special Treatment of Companies in the
Financial and Insurance Sectors and Pension Funds ”).
19.3.1.2.2 Sole Proprietors
If the shares are held as business assets by a sole proprietor with a tax domicile in Germany, only
60.0% of the gains on the disposal of the shares are subject to a progressive income tax (plus thesolidarity surcharge) at a total tax rate of up to approximately 47.5% (partial-income method).Only 60.0% of the losses on the disposal and expenses economically related thereto are taxdeductible. The partial income method does not apply with respect to church tax (if applicable).If the shares belong to a German permanent establishment of a business operation of the soleproprietor, 60.0% of the gains of the disposal of the shares are, in addition, subject to trade tax.
Trade tax can be credited towards the shareholder’s personal income tax, either in full or in part,
by means of a lump-sum tax credit method – depending on the level of the municipal trade taxmultiplier and certain individual tax-relevant circumstances of the taxpayer.
19.3.1.2.3 Partnerships
If the shareholder is a partnership with a tax domicile in Germany, the income or corporate
income tax is not levied at the level of the partnership but at the level of the respective partners.The taxation depends on whether the partner is a corporation or an individual. If the partner is acorporation, the gains on the disposal of the shares as contained in the profit share of the
498
partner will be taxed in accordance with the principles applicable for corporations (see
“19.3.1.2.1 Corporations ” above). For capital gains in the profit share of a partner that is an
individual, the principles outlined above for sole proprietors apply accordingly (partial-incomemethod, see above under “ 19.3.1.2.2 Sole Proprietors ”). Upon application and subject to further
conditions, an individual as a partner can obtain a reduction of his personal income tax rate forearnings not withdrawn from the partnership.
In addition, gains on the disposal of shares are subject to trade tax at the level of a commercial or
deemed commercial partnership, if the shares are attributed to a domestic permanentestablishment of a business operation of the partnership: Generally, 60.0% of the gain as far asthe shares are attributable to the profit share of an individual as the partner of the partnership,and, currently, 5.0% as far as the shares are attributable to the profit share of a corporation asthe partner of the partnership. Losses on disposals and other profit reductions in connection withthe shares are currently not considered for the purposes of trade tax if they are attributable tothe profit share of a corporation, and are taken into account at 60.0% in the context of generallimitations if they are attributable to the profit share of an individual.
If the partner of the partnership is an individual, the portion of the trade tax paid by the
partnership attributable to his profit share will generally be credited, either in full or in part,against his personal income tax by means of a lump-sum method – depending on the level of themunicipal trade tax multiplier and certain individual tax-relevant circumstances of the taxpayer.
19.3.2 Taxation of Capital Gains of Shareholders with a Non-German Tax Domicile
Capital gains derived from the disposal of shares by shareholders with no tax domicile in
Germany are only subject to German tax if the selling shareholder has a Qualified Holding in theCompany or the shares belong to a domestic permanent establishment or fixed place of businessor are part of business assets for which a permanent representative in Germany has beenappointed.
Pursuant to a decision of the German Federal Fiscal Court ( Bundesfinanzhof ) dated May 31, 2017
(Federal Tax Gazette ( Bundessteuerblatt ), part II of 2018, p. 144), in case of a Qualified Holding,
the capital gain on the disposal of shares is not subject to German taxation if the shareholder is acorporation which is not tax resident in Germany and neither maintains a permanentestablishment nor has appointed a permanent representative in Germany.
If the shareholder is a private individual, only 60.0% of the gains on the disposal of the shares
are subject to progressive income tax plus the solidarity surcharge thereon and church tax, ifapplicable. However, most double taxation treaties provide for a partial or full relief fromGerman taxation and assign the right of taxation to the shareholder’s country of residence.Where a Domestic Paying Agent is involved, withholding tax on capital gains is generally leviedat a rate of 25.0% (plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge thereon, resulting in an aggregate withholdingtax rate of 26.375%). However, if (i) the shares are not held through a permanent establishmentor fixed place of business or as business assets for which a permanent representative is appointedin Germany and (ii) a Domestic Paying Agent is involved, then, pursuant to a tax decree issued bythe German Federal Ministry of Finance ( Bundesministerium der Finanzen ) on January 18, 2016,
the Domestic Paying Agent will in general not be required to withhold the tax on capitalinvestment income (plus solidarity surcharge thereon). In the case of a Qualified Holding, thecapital gains must be declared in a tax return and will be taxed via an assessment procedure if noexemption under a double taxation treaty or under domestic law applies.
With regard to gains or losses on the disposal of shares belonging to a domestic permanent
establishment or fixed place of business, or which are part of business assets for which apermanent representative in Germany has been appointed, the above-mentioned provisionspertaining to shareholders with a tax domicile in Germany whose shares are business assets applyaccordingly (see “ 19.3.1.2 Shares Held as Business Assets ”). The Domestic Paying Agent can
refrain from deducting the withholding tax if the shareholder declares to the Domestic PayingAgent on the officially prescribed form that the shares form part of domestic business assets andcertain other requirements are met.
499
19.4 Special Treatment of Companies in the Financial and Insurance Sectors
and Pension Funds
If credit institutions ( Kreditinstitute ) or financial services institutions ( Finanzdienstleistungsinstitute )
hold or sell shares that are allocable to their trading portfolio ( Handelsbestand ) pursuant to
Section 340e para. 3 of the German Corporate Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch ), they will neither be able
to benefit from the partial income method nor be entitled to the effective 95.0% exemption fromcorporate income tax plus the solidarity su rcharge and any applicable trade tax. Thus, dividend
income and capital gains are fully taxable. The same applies to shares acquired by financialinstitutions in the meaning of the German Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz ) held in the majority by
credit institutions or financial services institu tions and where the shares are to be allocated to the
current assets ( Umlaufvermögen ) as of the date of acquisition. The preceding sentence applies
accordingly for shares held in a permanent estab lishment in Germany by financial institutions,
financial service institutions and financial institu tions tax resident in another EU Member State or in
other signatory states of the Treaty on the EEA.
Likewise, the tax exemption described earlier afforded to corporations for dividend income and
capital gains from the sale of shares does not apply to shares that qualify as a capital investmentin the case of life insurance and health insurance companies, or those which are held by pensionfunds.
However, an exemption to the foregoing, and thus a 95.0% effective tax exemption, applies to
dividends obtained by the aforementioned companies, to which the Parent-Subsidiary Directiveapplies. In addition, applicable double taxation treaties might provide further relief fromGerman tax, subject to certain prerequisites, e.g., substance requirements and holding periods,
being met.
19.5 Inheritance and Gift Tax
The transfer of shares to another person by way of inheritance or gift is generally subject toGerman inheritance or gift tax if:
(i) the place of residence, habitual abode, place of management or registered office of the
decedent, the donor, the heir, the donee or another acquirer is, at the time of the assettransfer, in Germany, or such person, as a German national, has prior to the transfer notspent more than generally five consecutive years outside of Germany without maintaining aplace of residence in Germany;
(ii) the decedent’s or donor’s shares belonged to business assets for which there had been a
permanent establishment in Germany or a permanent representative had been appointed;or
(iii) the decedent or the donor, at the time of the succession or gift, held a direct or indirect
interest of at least 10.0% of the Company’s share capital either alone or jointly with otherrelated parties.
The small number of double taxation treaties in respect of inheritance and gift tax which
Germany has concluded to date usually provide for German inheritance or gift tax only to belevied in the cases under (i) and, subject to certain restrictions, in the cases under (ii). Specialprovisions apply to certain German nationals living outside of Germany and to former Germannationals.
19.6 Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge
On December 13, 2019, the law regarding a significant reduction of the solidarity surcharge(Gesetz zur Rückführung des Solidaritätszuschlags 1995 ) came into force. Even though, this new
law has no impact on the solidarity surcharge levied in addition to the withholding tax, it canaffect the solidarity surcharge levied on the income tax liability which the withholding tax iscredited against, as the case may be. According to this new law the threshold as of whichsolidarity surcharge is levied will be significantly increased, so that the solidarity surcharge shall
500
be abolished in full for approximately 90% of the German taxpayers and partly for a further
6.5% of German taxpayers. The new rules apply as of 2021. Shareholders are advised to monitorfurther future developments.
19.7 Other Taxes
No German capital transfer taxes, value-added-tax, stamp duties or similar taxes are currentlylevied on the purchase or disposal or other forms of transfer of the shares. However, anentrepreneur may opt to subject disposals of shares, which are in principle exempt from value-added-tax, to value-added-tax if the sale is made to another entrepreneur for the entrepreneur’sbusiness. Wealth tax is currently not levied in Germany.
On February 14, 2013, the EU Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Directive (the “ Draft
Directive ”) on a common financial transaction tax (“ FTT”) to be implemented in Austria,
Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Slovakia, and Slovenia (the“Participating Member States ”). Estonia has stated in 2015 that it will not participate in
implementing the proposed FTT.
The Draft Directive has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in
the shares (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The Draft Directivefocused on levying a FTT on financial transactions (as defined in the Draft Directive), includingthe purchase, sale and exchange of financial instruments. Under the Draft Directive, the rate ofthe FTT would not be lower than 0.1% (0.01% for derivatives), generally based on the amount ofthe paid or owed consideration or in case of derivatives, the notional amount referred to in thederivatives contract at the time of the financial transaction. The issuance and subscription ofshares should, however, be exempt.
Since the date of the publication of the Draft Directive, discussions have taken place between the
Participating Member States. According to a statement of the German Federal Ministry ofFinance ( Bundesministerium der Finanzen ) dated May 25, 2020, the work on the legal framework
for the FTT is well advanced and shall be finalized in the second half of the calendar year 2020.The FTT is expected to be modelled on the existing French FTT legislation. Consequently, the FTTis expected to apply to the acquisition of shares in domestic companies with a marketcapitalization of more than €1 billion and at a rate of 0.2%.
Nevertheless, the FTT remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States
and was (and most probably will be) the subject of legal challenge. It may still be altered prior toits adoption. Moreover, once any directive has been adopted, it will need to be implemented intothe respective domestic laws of the participating member states, and the domestic provisionsimplementing the directive might deviate from the directive itself. Finally, additional EU memberstates may decide to participate in or to dismiss the implementation.
Prospective holders of the Shares are advised to monitor future developments closely and should
consult their own tax advisers in relation to the consequences of the FTT.

20 Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following is a description of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to the U.S. Holders
described below of the Spin-Off and of owning and disposing of New Shares, but it does notpurport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to aparticular person. This discussion does not address U.S. state, local and non-U.S. taxconsequences. This discussion applies only to U.S. Holders that, for U.S. federal income taxpurposes, hold Siemens AG shares or ADRs as capital assets, and (in the case of U.S. Holders ofSiemens AG’s shares receiving New Shares in the Spin-Off) will hold the New Shares as capitalassets. In addition, this discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may berelevant in light of a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including alternative minimum taxconsequences, the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income and tax consequencesapplicable to U.S. Holders subject to special rules, such as:
 certain financial institutions; dealers or traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of tax accounting; persons holding Siemens AG shares, ADRs or Shares as part of a hedging transaction, straddle,
wash sale, conversion transaction or integrated transaction or persons entering into aconstructive sale with respect to such securities;
 persons whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar; entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes; tax-exempt entities, “individual retirement accounts” or “Roth IRAs”; persons whose Siemens AG shares, ADR or Shares constitute a Qualified Holding (as defined in
“19 Taxation of Shareholders in Germany ”);
 persons that own or are deemed to own ten percent or more of Siemens AG or the Company’s
stock by vote or value; or
 persons holding Siemens AG shares, ADRs or Shares in connection with a trade or business
conducted outside of the United States.
If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Siemens
AG shares, ADRs or New Shares, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generallydepend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holdingany such securities and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisers as to theU.S. federal income tax consequences of the Spin-Off and of receiving, holding and disposing ofthe New Shares.
This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “ Code ”),
administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions, final, temporary and proposed U.S. Treasuryregulations, and the income tax treaty between Germany and the United States (the “ Treaty ”),
all as of the date hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
A“U.S. Holder ” is a person that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of
Siemens AG shares or ADRs and:
 a citizen or individual resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes; a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the
laws of the United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or
 an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of
its source.
U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign
tax consequences of the Spin-Off and of receiving, owning and disposing of New Shares in theirparticular circumstances.
This discussion assumes that Siemens AG has not been, and the Company will not be, a passive
foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “ PFIC”) for any taxable year,
except as specifically described below under “ 20.4 Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules ”.
502
20.1 Tax Consequences of the Spin-Off
The Spin-Off has not been structured to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, and no ruling has been sought from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Siemens AGbelieves that the distribution of New Shares pursuant to the Spin-Off will constitute a taxabledistribution to U.S. Holders with respect to Siemens AG’s shares, to the extent of Siemens AG’scurrent or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income taxprinciples). Because Siemens AG does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits underU.S. federal income tax principles, it is expected that the distribution of New Shares will bereported to U.S. Holders as a dividend. The amount of the dividend will equal the fair marketvalue of the New Shares on the date of the Spin-Off, and a U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in theNew Shares equal to that fair market value.
As described in section “ 5.3.6 ADR Program ”, New Shares that U.S. Holders of ADRs would
otherwise be entitled to receive in the Spin-Off will instead be sold by the depositary for cash onbehalf of the U.S. Holders. U.S. Holders of ADRs will be treated as if they received a taxabledistribution of the New Shares on the date of the Spin-Off and then sold such New Shares forcash when they are disposed of by the Depositary. U.S. Holders will recognize dividend income inan amount equal to the fair market value of the New Shares on the date of the Spin-Off asdescribed above, and will also recognize short-term capital gain or loss in an amount equal to thedifference (if any) between the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the New Shares and the amount of cashrealized on the sale of the New Shares by the depositary (each as determined in U.S. dollars). TheU.S. Holder’s tax basis in the New Shares will be equal to their U.S. dollar value as of the date ofthe Spin-Off (that is, the amount includible in income as dividend income as described above inthis paragraph).
The dividend income will be foreign-source and U.S. Holders will not be eligible for the
dividends-received deduction generally available to U.S. corporations under the Code. Subject toapplicable limitations, dividends included in income of certain non-corporate U.S. Holders may betaxable at a favorable rate. Such U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding theavailability of the favorable tax rate on dividends in their particular circumstances.
20.2 Taxation of Distributions on the New Shares
Distributions paid on New Shares will generally be treated as dividends to the extent paid out ofthe Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federalincome tax principles). Because the Company will not maintain calculations of its earnings andprofits under U.S. federal income tax principles, it is expected that distributions generally will bereported to U.S. Holders as dividends. The amount of dividend income will include any amountswithheld by the Company in respect of German taxes. Dividends will be treated as foreign-sourceincome to U.S. Holders and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generallyavailable to U.S. corporations under the Code. Subject to applicable limitations, dividends paid tocertain non-corporate U.S. Holders may be taxable at a favorable rate. Such U.S. Holders shouldconsult their tax advisers regarding the availability of the favorable tax rate on dividends.
Dividends will be included in a U.S. Holder’s income on the date of the U.S. Holder’s receipt of
the dividend. The amount of any dividend paid in euros will be the U.S. dollar amount calculatedby reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether thepayment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. If the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars on thedate of receipt, a U.S. Holder should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss inrespect of the dividend income. A U.S. Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if thedividend is converted into U.S. dollars after the date of receipt.
Subject to applicable limitations, non-refundable German income taxes withheld from dividends
on New Shares at a rate not exceeding the rate applicable under the Treaty will be creditableagainst the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. German taxes withheld in excess of therate applicable under the Treaty or that are otherwise refundable will not be eligible for creditagainst a U.S. Holder’s federal income tax liability. The rules governing foreign tax credits are
503
complex, and U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the creditability of foreign
taxes in their particular circumstances. In lieu of claiming a foreign tax credit, U.S. Holders may,at their election, deduct foreign taxes, including German taxes, in computing their taxableincome, subject to generally applicable limitations under U.S. law. An election to deduct foreigntaxes instead of claiming foreign tax credits applies to all taxes paid or accrued in the taxableyear to foreign countries and possessions of the United States.
20.3 Sale or Other Disposition of New Shares
Gain or loss realized on the sale or other disposition of New Shares will be capital gain or loss,and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the New Shares for more thanone year. The amount of the gain or loss will equal the difference between the U.S. Holder’s taxbasis in the Shares disposed of and the amount realized on the disposition, in each case asdetermined in U.S. dollars. This gain or loss will generally be U.S.-source gain or loss for foreigntax credit purposes. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. As described underSection “ 19.3.2 Taxation of Capital Gains of Shareholders with a Non-German Tax Domicile”, in
certain limited circumstances German tax may be imposed on disposition gains and U.S. Holdersshould consult their tax advisers regarding the credibility of any such taxes (and should be awarethat any such tax will generally not be creditable to the extent it is exempt under German law orthe Treaty).
20.4 Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules
In general, a foreign corporation will be a PFIC for any taxable year in which (i) 75.0% or more ofits gross income consists of passive income (such as dividends, interest or certain rents androyalties) or (ii) 50.0% or more of the average value of its assets (generally determined on aquarterly basis) consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.If a corporation owns at least 25.0% (by value) of the stock of another corporation, thecorporation will be treated, for purposes of the PFIC tests, as owning its proportionate share ofthe 25.0%-owned corporation’s assets and receiving its proportionate share of the 25.0%-ownedcorporation’s income.
Based upon the nature of its expected business, the Company does not expect to be a PFIC for its
current taxable year or in the foreseeable future. However, because PFIC status depends on thecomposition of a company’s income and assets and the market value of its assets from time totime, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be a PFIC for any taxable year.
If the Company were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder held New Shares,
gain recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale or other disposition (including certain pledges) of theNew Shares would be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the New Shares.The amounts allocated to the taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to any year beforethe Company became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to eachother taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals orcorporations, as applicable, for that taxable year, and an interest charge would be imposed onthe tax attributable to the allocated amounts. Further, to the extent that any distributionreceived by a U.S. Holder on its New Shares exceeds 125.0% of the average of the annualdistributions on the New Shares received during the preceding three years or the U.S. Holder’sholding period, whichever is shorter, that distribution would be subject to taxation in the samemanner as gain, described immediately above. Certain elections may be available that wouldresult in alternative treatments (such as mark-to-market treatment) of the New Shares.
As described in “ 20.1 Tax Consequences of the Spin-Off ”, U.S. Holders will be treated as receiving
taxable distributions of New Shares pursuant to the Spin-Off. Generally, if Siemens AG were aPFIC for any taxable year during the U.S. Holder’s holding period of Siemens AG’s shares or ADRs,to the extent that such distribution exceeds 125.0% of the average of the annual distributions onSiemens AG shares or ADRs received during the preceding three years or the U.S. Holder’sholding period, whichever is shorter, the distribution would be subject to taxation in the samemanner as described in the preceding paragraph. Siemens AG believes it was not a PFIC for its
504
most recent taxable year and does not expect to be a PFIC for its current taxable year. However,
Siemens AG has not analyzed or made any determination as to its PFIC status for any recenttaxable years.
U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding Siemens AG and the Company’s PFIC
status, and the application of the PFIC rules to the Spin-Off and their ownership of the NewShares.
20.5 Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
The distribution of New Shares in connection with the Spin-Off and payments of dividends andsales proceeds, in each case, that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries generally are subject to information reporting, and may besubject to backup withholding, unless (i) the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient or (ii) in the caseof backup withholding, the U.S. Holder provides a correct taxpayer identification number andcertifies that it is not subject to backup withholding.
The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a
credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle it to a refund,provided that the required information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.
Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals (and certain specified entities) may be required to report
information relating to their ownership of the New Shares, or any non-U.S. accounts throughwhich the New Shares are held. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding theirreporting obligations with respect to the New Shares.

B. Notes to the Condensed Combined Interim Financial
Statements
For the nine months ended June 30, 2020
NOTE 1 Basis of presentation
The accompanying Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements should be read in
conjunction with Siemens Energy Combined Financial Statements for the fiscal years endedSeptember 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Purpose and content of the Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements
On May 7, 2019, Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (“Siemens AG”) announced its plans to publicly list
the Siemens Energy Business (referred to hereafter as “Siemens Energy”) in the form of aspin-off, by issuing Siemens Energy shares to shareholders of Siemens AG and a subsequentlisting of these shares. Siemens AG plans to retain a minority stake in Siemens Energy. The parentcompany of Siemens Energy, and thus the issuer of shares for the spin-off, will be Siemens EnergyAG (until April 2, 2020: Kyros 52 Aktiengesellschaft) with registered office in Munich (registrynumber HRB 252581), Germany. Siemens Energy AG (referred to hereafter as “the company”)became economically active on April 1, 2020 (before this date and until spin-off the companydoes not have any operating business). Upon completion of the proposed transaction structure,Siemens Energy AG will be the parent company of the future Siemens Energy Group and willdirectly hold 100% of the partnership interest of Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG and100% of the interest of Siemens Gas and Power Management GmbH, the sole general partner ofSiemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG. Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG wasincorporated in fiscal 2019 and will directly and indirectly hold shares in all Siemens Energycompanies.
Siemens Energy has been separated from Siemens AG and its subsidiaries (“Siemens Group”) in
several steps. In an initial preparatory step, activities that had not been conducted by separatecompanies have been or will be transferred to separate legal entities, either by carving out theSiemens Energy Businesses or in some countries (for example in Brazil, Norway and Israel) bycarving out the businesses within the legal entities that remain with Siemens Group (reversecarve-out). All activities that form the Siemens Energy Business are then placed under the controlof Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG.
The transfer of the Siemens Energy Business that has been bundled in and under Siemens Gas
and Power GmbH & Co. KG will be implemented in two steps. First, the participation held bySiemens Beteiligungen Inland GmbH (“SBI GmbH”) in Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KGand a portion of the participation held by Siemens AG in Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KGas well as corresponding participations held in the Siemens Gas and Power Management GmbHwill be contributed to Siemens Energy AG by way of capital increases in kind. SBI GmbH andSiemens AG will each receive shares in Siemens Energy AG created by way of the capital increasein return. To ensure value congruence between the shares being issued and the contribution,Siemens AG will also receive a cash payment. This was contractually agreed on May 22, 2020,where Siemens AG and SBI GmbH on the one side and Siemens Energy AG on the other sideentered into a notarized contribution agreement.
In a second step, Siemens AG will spin off its remaining limited partnership interest in Siemens
Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG and its remaining shares in the Siemens Gas and PowerManagement GmbH to Siemens Energy AG by way of a spin-off for absorption under the GermanTransformation Act (“Umwandlungsgesetz”, “UmwG”).
The Siemens shareholders will receive Siemens Energy shares corresponding to their participation
in Siemens AG. The shares required for this purpose will be created by an additional capitalincrease in exchange for a contribution in kind of Siemens Energy AG. This was contractuallyagreed on May 22, 2020, where Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG entered into a notarizedSpin-off and Transfer Agreement, which was approved by the shareholders’ meeting of Siemens
F-9
AG on July 9, 2020 and previously approved by the shareholders’ meeting of Siemens Energy AG.
Siemens AG, acting as the sole shareholder of Siemens Energy AG, granted its consent to theSpin-off and Transfer Agreement at the shareholders’ meeting of Siemens Energy AG in May2020. After the implementation of the spin-off, the Siemens Group together with the pensionfund, Siemens Pension-Trust e.V., will hold 45% and the Siemens Shareholders will hold 55% ofthe shares in Siemens Energy AG.
As regards the future participation of the Siemens Group in Siemens Energy AG, Siemens AG, SBI
GmbH and Siemens Energy AG have entered into a Deconsolidation Agreement(“Entherrschungsvertrag”) in the context of the conclusion of the Spin-off and TransferAgreement. The Siemens Energy Business is to be conducted by Siemens Energy AGautonomously and independently of Siemens AG.
According to the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980 of March 14, 2019, Annex I,
item 18.1.1., supplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, an issuer must present historical financialinformation covering the latest three fiscal years in its securities prospectus. Furthermore,according to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980 of March 14, 2019, Article 18para 1 in connection with Article 18 para 3, Siemens Energy AG, as the issuer, has a “ComplexFinancial History” as of the share issuance date and needs to prepare additional financialinformation. Therefore, in addition to the Combined Financial Statements for the fiscal yearsfrom October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019, from October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018 andfrom October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017, Siemens Energy presents Condensed CombinedInterim Financial Statements for the nine month period ended June 30, 2020.
These Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements consist of Combined Statements of
Income, Combined Statements of Comprehensive Income, Combined Statements of FinancialPosition, Combined Statements of Cash Flows, Combined Statements of Changes in Equity andNotes to the Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements for the nine month period fromOctober 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 (collectively referred to hereafter as “Condensed CombinedInterim Financial Statements”).
The Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements have been prepared and published
generally in millions of euro ( €million). Rounding differences may occur in respect of individual
amounts or percentages.
The Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements are unaudited and were authorized for
issue by the Managing Board of Siemens Energy AG on July 30, 2020.
Definition of Siemens Energy Business
The accompanying Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements as of June 30, 2020
present Siemens Energy entities and operations. Siemens Energy is one of the largest suppliers oftechnology in the energy and electricity sector with an integrated setup that encompasses theentire scope of the energy market. It provides a portfolio along the entire energy value chain – inboth conventional and renewable energy, supported by a complete set of training and serviceofferings. This comprehensive portfolio supports public- and private-sector customers along thecontinuum of energy – from power generation to power transmission and the related servicesbusinesses.
Siemens Energy’s operations include the following two reportable segments: Gas and Power (GP), which offers a broad spectrum of products and solutions for the
generation of energy, along the entire value chain in the oil and gas industry and theconstruction and operation of power transmission networks;
 Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE), which offers on- and offshore wind turbines as
well as services throughout the whole lifecycle of wind turbines.
F-10
Basis for Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements
These Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) applicable to interim financial reporting asadopted by the European Union (“EU”), and, in particular, for interim financial statementsaccording to International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 34, Interim Financial Reporting. TheCondensed Combined Interim Financial Statements apply the same accounting principles andpractices as those used in the Combined Financial Statements as of September 30, 2019 with theexception of IFRS 16, Leases, and IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (refer toRecently adopted Accounting Pronouncements). Results for the interim reporting are notnecessarily indicative for future results. In interim periods, tax expense is based on the currentestimated annual effective tax rate of Siemens Energy.
The Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern and a
historical cost basis as included in the Siemens AG Consolidated Financial Statements, based onthe Siemens AG date of transition to IFRS (October 1, 2004). Since IFRS provides no guidelines forthe preparation of Combined Financial Statements, rules given in IAS 8.12 have been used.IAS 8.12 requires the consideration of the most recent pronouncements of other standard-settingbodies, other financial requirements and recognized industry practices. Following IAS 8.12, thepredecessor accounting approach has been applied in the Condensed Combined Interim FinancialStatements. Due to the classification of Siemens Energy as discontinued operations at the level ofSiemens AG, the extraction approach has been adjusted for the accounting policies and valuationmethods applied when presenting Siemens Energy as a group of companies independent ofSiemens AG. In particular, this includes the assessment of useful lives and impairments of assetsincluding investments and associated companies by Siemens Energy Management.
Except for the cases stated above, the same accounting policies and measurement principles have
been applied in preparing the Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements as used by theSiemens Energy entities and operations in preparing their financial information for inclusion inthe financial information as of June 30, 2020 published by Siemens AG.
The Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements of Siemens Energy reflect the following
businesses:
 the segment Gas and Power (GP)
1;
 the segment Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE).With the exception of the stake in Siemens Ltd., India, these businesses have been presented as
discontinued operations starting from the Half-year Consolidated Financial Statements ofSiemens AG as of March 31, 2020.
For a list of legal entities that are included in the Condensed Combined Interim Financial
Statements, refer to Scope of combination.
The Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements for Siemens Energy are derived as
follows:
The financial information for the segment GP included in the Condensed Combined Interim
Financial Statements is derived from the segment reporting of Siemens Group, before applyingthe presentation and measurement principles of IFRS 5 for discontinued operations. The segmentreporting included certain cost allocations for centrally managed functions prior to the legalseparation.
The financial information for the segment SGRE included in the Condensed Combined Interim
Financial Statements is derived from the segment reporting of Siemens Group, before applyingthe presentation and measurement principles of IFRS 5 for discontinued operations.
1The segment GP now includes the 24% minority stake in Siemens Ltd., India, which is an associated company and accounted
for using the at equity method. The treatment of the shares (24% of historical book values) already in the Siemens EnergyCombined Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was based on the expectation ofboth the management of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy that the sale of the minority stake in Siemens Ltd., India will besuccessfully completed before spin-off. The sale materialized on May 19, 2020.
F-11
The financial information for the minority stake in Siemens Ltd., India is derived from the
Siemens AG IFRS reporting package of this entity.
In addition, in order to reflect the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that fall within the
scope of Siemens Energy, the following combination rules have been applied. The managementuses significant judgment in determining these combination rules. Thus, the CondensedCombined Interim Financial Statements presented do not necessarily reflect the financialposition, cash flows or results of operations that would have occurred if Siemens Energy hadexisted as a separate group in the periods presented.

Energy for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 was determined on the principles of the legalreorganization approach. This approach is based on the fact that the economic activities thatform the new group were not managed centrally in the past, but the entities are legally boundtogether within a reorganization process. During the reporting periods of the CondensedCombined Interim Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities forming the reporting entitywere under common control of Siemens AG.
The scope of combination includes companies and businesses that will be directly or indirectly
and fully or partially owned by Siemens Energy AG after the spin-off of the Siemens EnergyGroup has been completed. This includes entities that were controlled by Siemens AG or itssubsidiaries during the reporting period of the Condensed Combined Interim FinancialStatements and for which a legal transfer to Siemens Energy AG is planned. Businesses inaccordance with IFRS 3 under common control that were transferred to Siemens Energy duringthe legal reorganization are included with their respective assets and liabilities as well as incomeand expenses in the Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements for all periods duringwhich Siemens AG controlled these entities.
For legal entities transferring to Siemens Energy that had already been fully dedicated to the
Siemens Energy Business and for which no carve-out has been required, the CondensedCombined Interim Financial Statements also includes all non-business assets, liabilities, incomeand expenses of the legal entity (mainly financing activities and real estate), with the exceptionof a one-off fee amounting to €655 million paid by Siemens Energy to Siemens Group for the
early termination of a loan payable to Siemens Group, which occurred in the nine months endedJune 30, 2020 in connection with the preparation of Siemens Energy’s future capital structure.Since the corresponding external loan from a Siemens Group perspective was not impacted bythis premature repayment, the profit impact was subsequently eliminated within equity.
For legal entities that required a legal separation, certain assets and liabilities or obligations
transferred to Siemens Energy that historically have not been part of the Siemens Energy Businessare recognized in the Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements at the time of theseparation as further detailed below. Balances related to the settlement of local purchase pricesof the Siemens Energy Business still held by other Siemens Group companies as of June 30, 2020have been eliminated.
Goodwill allocation
The goodwill included in the Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements is based on the
goodwill attributable to the Siemens Energy Business. The goodwill amount reflected in theCondensed Combined Interim Financial Statements comprises the goodwill attributable to thesegment SGRE as included in the Siemens Group segment reporting as well as goodwill attributableto the segment GP as reported in the Siemens Group segment reporting for the operating companyGas and Power which was allocated to the Siemens Energy Business adjusted for legal entitieswhere legal transfer is not planned, based on a relative value approach.
The goodwill is allocated and to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever
there is an indication of impairment, at the level of groups of cash-generating units, representedby the segment GP and for SGRE one level below the segment. This is the lowest level at which
F-12
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. As of March 31, 2020, the
recoverability of goodwill was assessed in the process of the held for disposal classification at thelevel of Siemens AG and no impairment was recorded.
Services provided and charged by centrally managed functions
Services provided by centrally managed functions from Siemens Group to Siemens Energy have
been included in the Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements as historically charged tothe business. For employees previously employed by such centrally managed functions of SiemensGroup that have been transferred to the Siemens Energy Business in line with the reorganization,employee-related expenses, assets and liabilities (including liabilities for pensions and similarobligations) have been included in the Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements fromthe occurrence of the transfer.
Pensions and similar obligations
The Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements of Siemens Energy present the pension
obligations of the Siemens Energy population and the corresponding plan assets.
The pension obligations for active employees, as well as for passives (with the exception of
Germany), have been transferred mainly in line with the legal reorganization. Therefore, themajority of pension obligations has been transferred during fiscal year 2020. In countries wherethe carve-out had not been completed as at June 30, 2020, the pension obligations and relatedplan assets may change considering specific requirements when the separation into SiemensEnergy legal entities becomes effective.
In Germany, the Siemens Group provides pension benefits through the following plans: BSAV
(Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), closed legacy plans and deferred compensation.Funding for such plans is currently provided via contractual trust arrangements (“CTAs”). Inrelation to Siemens Energy, Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG has set up a CTA which actsas the pension trust (the “GP Trust”) for German entities. Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KGacts as sole trustor for the BSAV and the legacy plans, while for the deferred compensation plansthe participating Group entities are acting as trustor. This CTA has been funded with assets thathad a fair value of approximately €915 million as at transfer date (January 2, 2020) and resulted
in an equivalent increase in Siemens Energy’s pension assets from that date.
Before carve-out, plan assets have been allocated by taking into consideration specific legal
requirements for the major countries. Where the respective employee has a right to claim aminimal funding or the plan assets were already allocated to individual employee accounts, planassets have been retrospectively allocated to Siemens Energy for the periods prior to the legaltransfer of the assets.
Income taxes
Income taxes, current and deferred income taxes are recognized for the purposes of the
Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements taking into consideration local taxrequirements. Income taxes are determined using the separate tax return approach under theassumption that the entities and operations of Siemens Energy constitute separate taxableentities. In interim periods, tax expense is based on the current estimated annual effective taxrate of Siemens Energy.
This assumption implies that current and deferred taxes for all companies and operations and tax
groups within Siemens Energy are calculated separately. The recoverability of deferred tax assetsis assessed on this basis. In the Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements deferred taxassets were recognized to the extent it is probable that they can be offset with future taxableincome from the respective Siemens Energy entities.
Tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards of Siemens
Energy entities and operations that did not constitute a separate taxpayer were treated ascontributions or transfers from reserves by shareholders and are not included in the Condensed
F-13
Combined Interim Financial Statements of Siemens Energy. The management of Siemens Energy
deems the approach as appropriate though not necessarily indicative of the tax expenses orincome that would result for Siemens Energy as a separate group.
Real estate assets
Assets that were leased from Siemens Real Estate and transferred to Siemens Energy as part of
the legal reorganization have been included in the Condensed Combined Interim FinancialStatements when the separation into Siemens Energy legal entities became effective. Beforetransfer, the leases have been reflected as such in the Condensed Combined Interim FinancialStatements. Apart from the effect of the initial application of IFRS 16, these transfers of realestate assets, including right-of-use assets, were the main driver for the increase of property,plant and equipment year-over-year.
Other centrally managed items
Other centrally managed items have been included in the Condensed Combined Interim Financial
Statements from the occurrence of the legal transfer of each entity. Until completion of thecarve-out, only business-related items as well as taxes are included in the Condensed CombinedInterim Financial Statements.
Capital structure
The equity of Siemens Energy consists of the net assets attributable to Siemens Energy. The
Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements do not show any subscribed capital, becauseSiemens Energy does not constitute a legal group during the period presented.
The equity of Siemens Energy as presented in the Condensed Combined Interim Financial
Statements has been impacted mainly by the following combination rules:
a) Any allocation of assets and liabilities to Siemens Energy in addition to those already
included in the segment reporting for the businesses as presented in the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements of Siemens AG was directly recognized in equity as withdrawal orcontribution at the time of the allocation;
b) any consideration given or received in the course of the formation of a group of entities was
directly recognized in equity as withdrawal or contribution at the time of the transfer;
c) any taxes paid from Siemens Group and related to Siemens Energy operations prior to the
carve-out, was directly recognized in equity;
d) any changes in the conversion of receivables and payables to cash related to Siemens Energy
operations prior to the carve-out, was directly recognized in equity;
category c) and d) was necessary because in the Siemens AG Consolidated Financial Statements
cash balances were not allocated to the Siemens Group operating segments but managedcentrally. Additionally, in Siemens Group legal entities tax payments were not assigned tooperating segments.
Recently adopted Accounting Pronouncements
IFRS 16, Leases, was adopted as of October 1, 2019, by applying the modified retrospective
approach (using practical and transition-related expedients), i.e. comparative figures for thepreceding year are not adjusted. IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model requiringlessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more thantwelve months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.
As of September 30, 2019, finance leases totaled €39 million; thereof GP €37 million and SGRE
€2 million. As of June 30, 2020, lease liabilities amounted to €1,204 million (October 1, 2019:
€896 million); thereof GP €598 million (October 1, 2019: €311 million) and SGRE €606 million
(October 1, 2019: €585 million).
F-14
As of October 1, 2019, right-of-use assets of €1,003 million were recognized in property, plant
and equipment, generally measured at the amount of the lease liability (in total: €896 million)
adjusted by any prepaid or accrued lease payments. Most of the transition effect relates to realestate leased by Siemens Energy. The difference between future payment obligations underoperating leases as of September 30, 2019 of €1,559 million and the gross lease liability as of
October 1, 2019 of €1,045 million mostly results from the application of transition-related
expedients. For leases between Siemens Real Estate and Siemens Energy that were to betransferred during fiscal 2020, no right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recognized prior tothe transfer.
The future lease payments from leases under the right-of-use model as of October 1, 2019 were
discounted using incremental borrowing rates (weighted average incremental borrowing rate asof October 1, 2019: 1.7%.)
On October 1, 2019, Siemens Energy retrospectively adopted IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income
Tax Treatments. The adoption had no material impact on the Condensed Combined InterimFinancial Statements.
Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19)
In the nine months ended June 30, 2020, Siemens Energy’s business and economic environment
has been adversely affected by the pandemic COVID-19 spread, though certain mitigating effectsmay arise due to the various measures taken by governments or states globally, includingfavorable financial support. As the outbreak continues to evolve, it is challenging to predict itsduration and its magnitude of impacts on assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows.In the June 30, 2020 Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements, Siemens Energycautiously based financial information related estimates and assumptions on existing knowledgeand best information available and applied a scenario assuming the current COVID-19 situation isof no long-term duration. COVID-19-related impacts on Siemens Energy’s Condensed CombinedInterim Financial Statements may inter alia result from interest rate adjustments in variouscountries, increasing volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, deteriorating creditworthiness,credit default or delayed payments, delays in order placements as well as in executing orders andcontracts, termination of contracts, adjusted or modified revenue and cost patterns, limitedusage of assets, volatility in financial and commodity markets, limited or no access to customerfacilities and hardship in preparing predictions and forecasts due to uncertainties in amount andtiming of cash flows. Those factors may impact fair value and carrying amounts of assets andliabilities, amount and timing of results of operations and cash flows. It requires complex andsubjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that areinherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Siemens Energy believes assumptions appliedappropriately reflect the current situation. Furthermore, accounting estimates are made indetermining the net realizable value of inventories taking into account quantity, technical andprice risk. With regard to goodwill the underlying assumptions used in the Q2 2020 impairmentassessment described above were reviewed in Q3 2020 and no changes were identified whichrequired impairment testing to be performed at June 30, 2020. The Company believesassumptions applied appropriately reflect the current situation. As regards specific singularimpacts related to COVID-19 please refer to Note 8 Segment Information .

Unipersonal (S.L. Unipersonal, hereinafter, “S.L.U.”) signed an agreement under which SiemensGamesa Renewable Energy Eólica, S.L.U. has acquired on January 9, 2020 all the shares of SenvionDeutschland GmbH (Senvion European Onshore Services), which includes the carved-outEuropean onshore service business of Senvion and certain additional assets associated to thebusiness, including certain related intellectual property of Senvion and based on which onApril 30, 2020, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. (hereinafter, “SGRE Portugal”) signed anagreement with Senvion Indústria, S.A., and Senvion GmbH i.L. by virtue of which all the sharesof Ria Blades, S.A., entity which owns and operates the business of the wind turbine bladesproduction facility in Vagos (Portugal) and certain additional assets associated to said businesswere acquired.
This acquisition is in line with SGRE’s strategy to grow its multibrand service business and its
production capacities and strengthens SGRE’s competitive position in Europe. The overall price tobe paid in cash for the shares of Senvion Deutschland GmbH and Ria Blades, S.A. amounts to€200 million, subject to closing accounts confirmation adjustments. The closing accounts related
adjustment mechanism for working capital, debt, maintenance cost and backlog deviations since30 June 2019 until 9 January 2020 has different caps and leads to a maximum overall price to bepaid by SGRE of €215 million, in case of positive adjustments, and a minimum overall cash
consideration of €180 million, in case of negative adjustments, considering that SGRE could be
entitled to further obtain, under certain circumstances, up to €10 million of additional current
assets, without change in the consideration paid. The price adjustment amount, within theestablished limits, will be resolved in the following months, and is referred to the transaction as awhole. At the time the final price adjustment is determined, the allocation of the resultingconsideration transferred to the different parts of the transaction will also be completed.
The assets and liabilities of Senvion Deutschland GmbH and its subsidiaries as well as the assets
and liabilities of Ria Blades, S.A. are included in the Condensed Combined Interim FinancialStatements at their acquisition date fair values. The accounting for these business combinationshas been determined provisionally as of June 30, 2020, due to the fact that the measurement ofthe acquired assets and liabilities has not yet been completed, as well as the twelve month periodsince the acquisition of Senvion Deutschland GmbH and Ria Blades, S.A. established by IFRS 3“Business Combinations” has not elapsed.
The preliminary purchase price allocation as of the acquisition dates of Senvion Deutschland
GmbH and Ria Blades results in: other intangible assets €151 million (related to the fair value of
order backlog and customer relationships), property, plant and equipment €92 million, cash and
cash equivalents €5 million, current and non-current provisions €132 million and other net assets
€2 million. The goodwill has been provisionally determined in an amount of €72 million and has
been provisionally substantially allocated to the goodwill carrying unit Operation andMaintenance.
As of June 30, 2020, the preliminary estimate for the consideration to be transferred amounts to
€190 million ( €186 million net of cash acquired). Until June 30, 2020, the consideration paid in
accordance with the milestones established in the acquisition agreement amounts to€182 million ( €177 million net of cash acquired).
The acquired businesses have contributed revenues of €81 million and a negative net result of
€6 million (pre-purchase price allocation impacts) to Siemens Energy for the period from
acquisition to June 30, 2020. The revenue and profit of the acquired entities for the currentreporting period as though the acquisition date had been as of the beginning of the annualreporting period amounts to €141 million and €5 million, respectively, (pre-purchase price
allocation impacts).
The transaction cost of €12.5 million have been recognized in selling and general administrative
expenses in the Combined Statements of Income.

the segment GP an impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations in theamount of €476 million has been recognized based on a level three discounted cash flow (DCF)
valuation model. To determine the recoverable amount, cash flow projections were used thattake into account past experience and represent management’s best estimate about futuredevelopments. The calculation is based on a terminal value growth rate of 0.0% and an after-taxdiscount rate of 9.56%. In this relation also inventories relating to this business have beenwritten down by €190 million. In addition, due to decreases of planned sales of gas turbines and
early termination of one larger customer contract, €35 million and, respectively, €37 million
inventory write downs were recorded. There were projects with project delays, the largest effectsamounted to €43 million.
F-21
In the segment SGRE, an impairment of intangible assets in the amount of €82 million, a write
down of inventories in the amount of €102 million and an impairment of property, plant and
equipment in the amount of €11 million have been recognized, as a result of the deterioration
of the Indian market and the corresponding restructuring plan. In addition and due to thechallenges faced in the onshore market compounded by COVID-19, SGRE has recognized projectcharges, the two largest in the amount of €183 million and €95 million for the challenges faced
in Northern Europe and India.

Siemens Energy
Notes to the Combined Financial Statements
for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017
NOTE 1 Basis of preparation
Purpose and content of the Combined Financial Statements
On May 7, 2019, Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and Munich announced its plans to publicly list
the Siemens Energy business (referred to hereafter as “Siemens Energy”) in the form of a spin-off,by issuing Siemens Energy shares to the shareholders of Siemens AG and a subsequent listing ofthese shares. Siemens AG plans to retain a minority stake in Siemens Energy. The parent companyof Siemens Energy and thus, the issuer of shares for the planned spin-off will be Siemens EnergyAG (until April 2, 2020: Kyros 52 Aktiengesellschaft) with registered office in Munich (registrynumber HRB 252581), Germany. The company became economically active on April 1, 2020 (beforethis date and until spin-off the company did not have any operating business). Siemens Gas andPower GmbH & Co. KG was incorporated in fiscal 2019 and will directly and indirectly hold sharesin all Siemens Energy companies. Upon completion of the proposed transaction structure, SiemensEnergy AG will be the parent company of the future Siemens Energy Group and will directly hold100% of the shares of Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG.
Siemens Energy is separated from Siemens AG and its subsidiaries (“Siemens Group”) in severalsteps. In an initial preparatory step, activities that had not been conducted by separatecompanies have been or will be transferred to separate legal entities, either by carving out theSiemens Energy businesses or by carving out the businesses within the legal entities that remainwith Siemens Group (reverse carve-out). All activities that form the Siemens Energy business arethen placed under the control of Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG. At the time of thespin-off, Siemens AG and Siemens Beteiligungen Inland GmbH (“SBI”) will contribute theirrespective stake in Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG to Siemens Energy AG against sharesin Siemens Energy AG, of which Siemens AG will spin-off a majority portion to the shareholdersof Siemens AG as a final step.
According to the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980 of March 14, 2019, Annex I,
item 18.1.1., supplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, an issuer must present historical financialinformation covering the latest three fiscal years in its securities prospectus. Furthermore,according to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980 of March 14, 2019, Article 18 para1 in connection with Article 18 para 3, Siemens Energy AG, as the issuer, has a “Complex FinancialHistory” as of the share issuance date and needs to prepare additional financial information.Therefore, Siemens Energy prepares historical financial information for the fiscal years fromOctober 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019, from October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018 and fromOctober 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 representing the Siemens Energy business under thecontrol of Siemens AG.
The Combined Financial Statements consist of Combined Statements of Income, Combined
Statements of Comprehensive Income, Combined Statements of Financial Position, CombinedStatements of Cash Flows, Combined Statements of Changes in Invested Equity and Notes to theCombined Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017(collectively referred to hereafter as “Combined Financial Statements”).
The Combined Financial Statements have been prepared and published in millions of euro
(€million). Rounding differences may occur in respect of individual amounts or percentages.
The Combined Financial Statements were authorized for issue on May 6, 2020 by the Managing
Board of Siemens AG.
F-54
Definition of Siemens Energy business
Siemens Energy is one of the largest suppliers of technology in the energy and electricity sector
with an integrated setup that encompasses the entire scope of the energy market. It provides aleading portfolio along the entire energy value chain – in both conventional and renewableenergy, supported by a complete set of training and service offerings. This comprehensiveportfolio supports public- and private-sector customers along the continuum of energy – frompower generation to power transmission and the related services businesses.
Siemens Energy’s operations include: Gas and Power, which offers a broad spectrum of products and solutions for the generation of
energy, along the entire value chain in the oil and gas industry and the construction andoperation of power transmission networks;
 Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE), which offers on- and offshore wind turbines as
well as services throughout the whole lifecycle of wind turbines.
Prior to the public listing of Siemens Energy, an internal reporting system has been established.
For the segment reporting in the Combined Financial Statements, this system has been usedretrospectively and in line with IFRS 8.
Combined Financial Statements
The Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”).
Since IFRS provides no guidelines for the preparation of Combined Financial Statements, rules
given in IAS 8.12 have been used. IAS 8.12 requires the consideration of the most recentpronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial requirements and recognizedindustry practices. Following IAS 8.12, the predecessor accounting approach has been applied inthe Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Energy.
The same accounting policies and measurement principles have been applied in preparing the
Combined Financial Statements as used by the Siemens Energy entities and operations inpreparing their financial information for inclusion in the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statementsof Siemens AG. Accounting estimates originally used in the IFRS Consolidated FinancialStatements of Siemens AG have not been adjusted to reflect potential new knowledge beforebeing included in the Combined Financial Statements.
The Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Energy reflect the following businesses as
included in the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens AG for the fiscal year endedSeptember 30, 2019, adjusted for legal entities where legal transfer is not planned;
 The segment Gas and Power; the segment Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy; the Process Solutions business, excluding the minerals business; the Subsea business; the Distribution Transformer business; the at-equity investments in Voith Hydro and Ethos Energy; the 24% minority stake in Siemens Limited India, which is fully consolidated at Siemens AG.
The treatment in the Combined Financial Statements (24% share of historical book values) isbased on the current expectation of both the management of Siemens AG and Siemens Energythat the sale of the minority stake in Siemens Limited India will be successfully completedbefore spin-off. The agreement between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy dated March 30,2020, specifies that should the sale not be completed before spin-off, Siemens AG may sell thestake in steps over a period of years. Consequently, accounting in the consolidated financialstatements after spin-off would follow the step-wise acquisition of the stake in SiemensLimited, India.
F-55
For a list of legal entities respectively business activities in legal entities which will be carved out
before transfer to Siemens Energy that are included in the Combined Financial Statements,please also refer to Note 28 – Scope of combination.
The Combined Financial Statements for Siemens Energy are derived as follows:The financial information for the segment Gas and Power included in the Combined Financial
Statements is derived from the segment reporting as presented in the Consolidated FinancialStatements of Siemens AG. This segment reporting included certain cost allocations for centrallymanaged functions prior to the legal separation.
The financial information for SGRE included in the Combined Financial Statements is derived from
the segment reporting as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens AG.
The financial information for the Process Solutions business (excluding the minerals business),
Subsea business and Distribution Transformer business included in the Combined FinancialStatements is derived from the sub-segment reporting and local Enterprise Resource Planning(ERP) systems. For selected items, the financial information is based on specific identification andattribution or allocation of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
In addition, in order to reflect the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that fall within the
scope of Siemens Energy, the following combination rules have been applied. The Management(as defined in Note 26 – Related party transactions) uses significant judgment in determining
these combination rules. Thus, the Combined Financial Statements presented here do notnecessarily reflect the financial position and results of operations that would have occurred ifSiemens Energy had existed as a separate group in the periods presented.
Scope of combination
The scope of combination for the Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Energy for the fiscal
years ended September 30, 2019, September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 was determinedon the principles of the legal reorganization approach. This approach is based on the fact thatthe economic activities that form the new group were not managed centrally in the past, but theentities are legally bound together within a reorganization process. During the reporting periodsof the Combined Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities forming the combination scopewere under common control of Siemens AG.
The scope of combination includes companies and businesses that will be directly or indirectly
and fully or partially owned by Siemens Energy AG after the Spin-off of the Siemens EnergyGroup has been completed. This includes entities that were controlled by Siemens AG or itssubsidiaries during the reporting periods of the Combined Financial Statements and for which alegal transfer to Siemens Energy AG is planned. Businesses in accordance with IFRS 3 undercommon control that will be transferred to Siemens Energy during the legal reorganization areincluded with their respective assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses in theCombined Financial Statements for all periods during which Siemens AG controlled these entities.
For legal entities transferring to Siemens Energy that had already been fully dedicated to the
Siemens Energy business and for which no carve out has been required, the Combined FinancialStatements also include all non-business assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the legal entity(mainly financing activities and real estate). For legal entities that required a legal separation,certain assets and liabilities or obligations transferred to Siemens Energy that historically havenot been part of the Siemens Energy business are recognized in the Combined FinancialStatements at the time of the transfer as further detailed below.
Goodwill allocation
The goodwill included in the Combined Financial Statements is based on the goodwill attributable
to the Siemens Energy business. The goodwill amount reflected in the Combined FinancialStatements comprises the goodwill attributable to the segment SGRE as included in the SiemensGroup segment reporting, as well as goodwill attributable to the segment Gas and Power and tothe other businesses in scope, which was allocated to the Siemens Energy business adjusted forlegal entities where legal transfer is not planned, based on a relative value approach.
F-56
During the periods presented, goodwill was allocated and tested based on the cash-generating
unit structure used at that time by Siemens Group to monitor goodwill as the Siemens Energyreporting structure did not exist in the past. For further details please also refer to Note 10 –
Goodwill .
Services provided and charged by centrally managed functions
Services provided by centrally managed functions from Siemens Group to Siemens Energy have
been included in the Combined Financial Statements for all periods presented as historicallycharged to the business. For employees previously employed by such centrally managed functionsof Siemens Group that have been transferred to the Siemens Energy business in line with thereorganization, employee-related expenses, assets and liabilities (including liabilities for pensionsand similar obligations) have been included in the Combined Financial Statements from theoccurrence of the transfer.
Pensions and similar obligations
The Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Energy present the pension obligations of the
Siemens Energy population and corresponding plan assets.
The pension obligations for active employees, as well as for passives, with the exception of
Germany, are transferred mainly in line with the legal reorganization. Therefore, the majority ofpension liabilities have been transferred during fiscal year 2020 prior to the listing of the shares.Pension obligations have retrospectively been allocated to Siemens Energy based on historicalemployee lists for all periods presented in the Combined Financial Statements. The pensionobligations may change in some countries considering specific requirements when the separationinto Siemens Energy legal entities becomes effective.
Plan assets have been allocated by taking into consideration specific legal requirements for the
major countries. Where the respective employee has a right to claim a minimal funding or theplan assets were already allocated to individual employee accounts, plan assets have beenretrospectively allocated to Siemens Energy for the periods prior to the legal transfer of theassets. Due to the fact that the legal transfer of these plan assets has not yet been completed,the actual amounts of the plan assets to be transferred may differ from the plan assets presentedin the Combined Financial Statements. For further details please also refer to Note 14 – Provisions
for pensions and similar obligations.
Income Taxes and Deferred Taxes
In accordance with IAS 12, “Income Taxes”, current and deferred income taxes are recognized for
the purposes of the Combined Financial Statements taking into consideration local taxrequirements. Income taxes are determined using the separate tax return approach under theassumption that the entities and operations of Siemens Energy constitute separate taxableentities.
This assumption implies that current and deferred taxes for all companies and operations and tax
groups within Siemens Energy are calculated separately. The recoverability of deferred tax assetsis assessed on this basis. In the Combined Financial Statements deferred tax assets wererecognized to the extent it is probable that they can be offset with future taxable income fromthe respective Siemens Energy entities.
Tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards of Siemens
Energy entities and operations that did not constitute a separate tax payer in previous years weretreated as contributions or transfers from reserves by shareholders, and are not included in theCombined Financial Statements of Siemens Energy.
Management deems the approach as appropriate though not necessarily indicative of the tax
expenses or income that would result for Siemens Energy as a separate group. For further details
please also refer to Note 6 – Income taxes.
F-57
Real Estate Assets
Assets that were leased from Siemens Real Estate and transferred to Siemens Energy as part of
the legal reorganization have been included in the Combined Financial Statements when theseparation into Siemens Energy legal entities became effective. Before legal transfer, the leaseshave been reflected as such in the Combined Financial Statements.
Other centrally managed items
Other centrally managed items have been included in the Combined Financial Statements from
the occurrence of the legal transfer of each entity. Until completion of the carve out onlybusiness-related items as well as pensions and taxes are included in the Combined FinancialStatements.
Capital Structure
The equity of Siemens Energy consists of the net assets attributable to Siemens Energy. The
Combined Financial Statements do not show any subscribed capital, because Siemens Energy doesnot constitute a legal group during the periods presented.
The equity of Siemens Energy as presented in the Combined Financial Statements has been
impacted mainly by the following combination rules:
a) any allocation of assets and liabilities to Siemens Energy in addition to those already
included in the segment reporting (or sub-segment reporting and local ERP systems in caseof the Subsea, Distribution Transformer business and Process Solutions business (excludingthe minerals business)) for the businesses as presented in the Consolidated FinancialStatements of Siemens AG was directly recognized in equity as withdrawal or contribution atthe time of the allocation;
b) any consideration given or received in the course of the formation of a group of entities was
directly recognized in equity as withdrawal or contribution at the time of the transfer;
c) any taxes paid by Siemens Group and related to Siemens Energy operations prior to the
carve-out, were directly recognized in equity;
d) any changes in the conversion of receivables and payables to cash related to Siemens Energy
operations prior to the carve-out, was directly recognized in equity;
category c) and d) are necessary because in the Siemens Group Consolidated Financial Statements
cash balances are not allocated to the Siemens Group operating segments, but managedcentrally. Additionally, in Siemens Group legal entities tax payments are not assigned tooperating segments.
As the formation of Siemens Energy has not been finalized as of September 30, 2019, further
changes in the capital structure have occurred. For further details please also refer to Note 27 –
Subsequent event .
Related Party Transactions
Transactions between Siemens Energy and the remaining Siemens Group are recognized in

Combined Statements of Cash Flows
According to IAS 7, “Cash Flow Statements”, the Combined Statements of Cash Flows of Siemens
Energy contain operating, investing and financing activities. Cash transactions resulting from thecentral cash management operated by the Siemens Group throughout the period presented aswell as cash transactions with other Siemens Group entities in conjunction with the formation ofthe group of entities have been included in the line item Financing transactions with Siemens
Group in the Cash Flows from Financing Activities of the Combined Statements of Cash Flows.

NOTE 2 Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates
The accounting principles set out below have, unless stated otherwise, been applied consistently
for all periods presented in these Combined Financial Statements.
Key accounting estimates and judgments – Certain of these accounting policies require
critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use ofassumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible tochange. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have amaterial impact on the results of operations, financial positions and cash flows of SiemensEnergy. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where Siemens Energyreasonably could have used a different estimate in the current accounting period. SiemensEnergy cautions that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely requireadjustment.
The estimates in accordance with the basis of preparation made in these Combined Financial
Statements are consistent with estimates made for the same date in accordance with thereporting requirements under IFRS as part of the consolidation group of Siemens AG, unlessthere is objective evidence that those estimates are not in accordance with IFRS on a stand-alonebasis. The areas involving a high degree of judgment and where estimates and assumptions aresignificant to the Combined Financial Statements are disclosed.
Business combinations – Cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given
and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired andliabilities assumed in a business combination (including contingent liabilities) are measuredinitially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of anynon-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportional fair value ofassets acquired and liabilities assumed (partial goodwill method). If there is no loss of control,transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as equity transactions not affectingprofit or loss. The non-controlling interests participate in profits and losses during the reportingperiod.
Associates – Associates are companies over which Siemens AG has the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies (generally through direct or indirectownership of 20% to 50% of the voting rights) and which are in scope of the Siemens Energybusiness. These are recorded in the Combined Financial Statements using the equity method andare initially recognized at cost. Siemens Energy’s share of its associate’s post-acquisition profits orlosses is recognized in the Combined Statements of Income, and its share of post-acquisitionchanges in equity that have not been recognized in the associate’s profit or loss is recognizeddirectly in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition changes are adjusted against the carryingamount of the investment in the associate. When Siemens Energy’s share of losses in an associateequals or exceeds its interest in the associate, Siemens Energy does not recognize further losses,unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the associate. The interest in anassociate is the carrying amount of the investment in the associate together with any long-terminterests that, in substance, form part of Siemens Energy’s net investment in the associate.
Joint ventures – Joint ventures are entities over which Siemens AG and one or more parties
have joint control and which are in scope of the Siemens Energy business. Joint control requiresunanimous consent of the parties sharing control in decision making on relevant activities.
Foreign currency translation – Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the
functional currency is other than the euro, are translated using the spot exchange rate at the endof the reporting period, while the Combined Statements of Income are translated using averageexchange rates during the period. Differences arising from such translations are recognizedwithin equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreignsubsidiary is recognized. The Combined Statements of Cash Flow are translated at averageexchange rates during the period, whereas cash and cash equivalents are translated at the spotexchange rate at the end of the reporting period.
F-59
Foreign currency transaction – Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than
the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at that functional currency applying the spotexchange rate at the date when the underlying transactions are initially recognized. At the endof the reporting period, foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities arerevalued to functional currency applying the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date. Gainsand losses arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized in net income. Thoseforeign currency-denominated transactions which are classified as non-monetary are remeasuredusing the historical spot exchange rate. Siemens Energy applies Hyperinflation accounting inVenezuela and Argentina. The effect from the indexation of non-monetary Balance Sheet itemsand Income items amount to €(9) million in fiscal 2019 (fiscal 2018: €(57) million and fiscal 2017:
€(11) million). Contrary effects on the net monetary position amounted to €8 million in fiscal
2019 (fiscal 2018: €43 million and fiscal 2017: €15 million).
Revenue recognition – Siemens Energy recognizes revenue, when or as control over distinct
goods or services is transferred to the customer; i.e. when the customer is able to direct the useof the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits,provided a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst otherscollectability of consideration is probable taking into account customer’s creditworthiness.Revenue is the transaction price Siemens Energy expects to be entitled to. Variable considerationis included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenuewill not occur once associated uncertainties are resolved. The amount of variable consideration iscalculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which isexpected to better predict the amount of variable consideration. Consideration is adjusted forthe time value of money if the period between the transfer of goods or services and the receiptof payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant financing benefit either to thecustomer or Siemens Energy. If a contract contains more than one distinct good or service, thetransaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative stand-aloneselling prices. If stand-alone selling prices are not observable, Siemens Energy reasonablyestimates those. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point in timeor over time.
Sales from construction-type contracts: Revenues are recognized over time under the
percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred to date comparedto total estimated costs. An expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expenseimmediately. Payment terms are usually 30 days from the date of invoice issued according to thecontractual terms.
The percentage-of-completion method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of
the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveriesand services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. These significant estimatesinclude total estimated costs, total estimated revenues, contract risks, including technical,political and regulatory risks, and other judgments. Under the percentage-of-completionmethod, changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. In addition,Siemens Energy needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it isterminated. In determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected tobe the most likely scenario, all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract areconsidered on an individual basis.
Revenues from services: Revenues are recognized over time on a straight-line basis or, if the
performance pattern is other than straight-line, as services are provided, i.e. under thepercentage-of-completion method as described above. Payment terms are usually 30 days fromthe date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.
Sale of goods: Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to
the buyer, usually upon delivery of the goods. Invoices are issued at that point in time and areusually payable within 30 days.
F-60
Functional costs – In general, operating expenses by types are assigned to the functions
following the functional area of the corresponding profit and cost centers. Amortization,depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment areincluded in functional costs depending on the use of the assets.
Product-related expenses – Provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties are
recorded in line item Cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized.
Research and development costs – Costs of research activities are expensed as incurred. Costs
of development activities are capitalized when the recognition criteria in IAS 38 are met.Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairmentlosses with an amortization period of generally three to ten years.
Goodwill – Goodwill is not amortized, instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as
well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) which suggestthat the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulatedimpairment losses. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cash-generatingunit or a group of cash-generating units, generally represented by a segment. SGRE is tested onelevel below the segment. During the periods presented, goodwill was tested for impairmentbased on the cash-generating unit structure used at that time by Siemens Group to monitorgoodwill as Siemens Energy and the new reporting structure did not exist in the past. For thepurpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to thecash-generating unit or the group of cash-generating units that is expected to benefit from thesynergies of the business combination. If the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit or thegroup of cash-generating units, to which the goodwill is allocated, exceeds its recoverableamount, an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to this cash-generating unit or this group ofcash-generating units is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the cash-generatingunit’s or the group of cash-generating units’ fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Ifeither of these values exceeds the carrying amount, it is not always necessary to determine bothvalues. These values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations.Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future periods.
The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-
generating units to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management.The outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e.g. by the successful integration ofacquired entities, volatility of capital markets, interest rate developments, foreign exchange ratefluctuations and the outlook on economic trends. In determining recoverable amounts,discounted cash flow calculations use five-year projections that are based on financial forecasts.Cash flow projections take into account past experience and represent management’s bestestimate about future developments. Cash flows after the planning period are extrapolatedusing individual growth rates. Key assumptions on which management has based itsdetermination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates andweighted average cost of capital. These estimates, including the methodology used, can have amaterial impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment.
Other intangible assets – Siemens Energy amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on
a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives for patents,licenses and other similar rights generally range from three to five years, except for intangibleassets with finite useful lives acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets acquired inbusiness combinations primarily consist of customer relationships and trademarks as well astechnology. Useful lives in specific acquisitions ranged from four to 20 years for customerrelationships and trademarks and from five to 25 years for technology.
F-61
Property, plant and equipment – Property, plant and equipment, is valued at cost less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation expense is recognized using thestraight-line method. The following useful lives are assumed:
Factory and office buildings .............................................. 20 to 50 years
Other buildings ......................................................... 5 to 10 years
Technical machinery & equipment ......................................... generally 10 years
Furniture & office equipment ............................................. generally 5 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets – Siemens
Energy reviews property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may notbe recoverable. In addition, intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual
impairment test. Impairment testing of property , plant and equipment and other intangible assets
involves the use of estimates in determining the assets’ recoverable amount which can have amaterial impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment.
Non-current assets / liabilities held for disposal – Non-current assets/liabilities are held for
disposal if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction ratherthan through continuing use.
Income taxes – Tax positions under respective local tax laws and tax authorities’ views can be
complex and subject to different interpretations of tax payers and local tax authorities. Differentinterpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax legislativeprocedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into accountbased on management’s considerations. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets andliabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between thefinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective taxbases. Deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable profit is available, includingincome from forecasted operating earnings, the reversal of existing taxable temporarydifferences and established tax planning opportunities. As of each period-end, Siemens Energyevaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets, generally based on five-years projected futuretaxable profits. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for futuretaxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, Siemens Energybelieves it is probable Siemens Energy will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. Asfuture developments are uncertain and partly beyond Siemens Energy’s control, assumptions arenecessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in which deferred tax assets willrecover. Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise theassumption.
Contract assets, contract liabilities, receivables – When either party to a contract with
customers has performed, Siemens Energy presents a contract asset, a contract liability or areceivable depending on the relationship between Siemens Energy’s performance and thecustomer’s payment. Contract assets and liabilities are presented as current since incurred in thenormal operating cycle. Receivables are recognized when the right to consideration becomesunconditional. Valuation allowances for credit risks are made for contract assets and receivablesin accordance with the accounting policy for financial assets measured at amortized cost.
Inventories – Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or production costs and net
realizable value, costs being generally determined based on an average or first-in, first-outmethod. Net realizable value corresponds to the estimated selling price net of remaining costs ofcompletion and selling.
Defined benefit plans – Siemens Energy measures the entitlements by applying the projected
unit credit method. The approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of thefuture benefit entitlement for services already rendered. In determining the net present value ofthe future benefit entitlement for service already rendered (Defined Benefit Obligation(“DBO”)), the expected rates of future salary increases and expected rates of future pension
F-62
progression are considered. The assumptions used for the calculation of the DBO as of the
period-end of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost andinterest income and expense of the following year. Starting in fiscal year 2018 significant plansapply individual spot rates from full discount rate curves to determine service cost and interestexpense. The net interest income or expense for the fiscal year will be based on the discount ratefor the respective year multiplied by the net defined benefit liability (asset) at the precedingfiscal year’s period-end date.
Service cost, past service cost and settlement gains (losses) for pensions and similar obligations as
well as administration costs unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated amongfunctional costs. Past service cost and settlement gains (losses) are recognized immediately inprofit or loss. For unfunded plans, the amount of the line item Provisions for pensions and similarobligations equals the DBO. For funded plans, Siemens Energy offsets the fair value of the planassets with the DBO. Siemens Energy recognizes the net amount, after adjustments for effectsrelating to any asset ceiling.
Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return
on plan assets and the amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability(asset). They are recognized in Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.
Actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates, expected compensation
increases, rate of pension progression and mortality rates. Discount rates used are determined byreference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at theend of the reporting period. In case such yields are not available, discount rates are based ongovernment bonds yields. Due to changing market, economic and social conditions, theunderlying key assumptions may differ from actual developments.
Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generallymeasured at the fair value of the underlying assets at period-end. If the performance of theunderlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return, the DBO is measured by projecting forwardthe contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back to a present value.
Provisions – A provision is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position when it is probable
that Siemens Energy has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it isprobable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and areliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material,provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at apretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. When a contractbecomes onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision.
Significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to warranty costs,
onerous contracts, legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations(Legal Proceedings). The measurement of warranty provisions reflects whether the underlyingobligation results from a single obligation or a larger population of items. The amounts providedare based on best available information but may vary from actual claims. Siemens Energy recordsa provision for onerous contracts with customers when current estimates of total estimated costsexceed estimated revenue. Onerous contracts with customers are identified by monitoring theprogress of the project and updating the estimates which requires significant judgment relatingto achieving certain performance standards as well as estimates involving warranty costs andestimates regarding project delays including the assessment of responsibility splits between thecontract partners for these delays.
Legal proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties.
Accordingly, considerable judgment is part of determining whether it is probable that there is apresent obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the reporting period, whether it isprobable that such a Legal proceeding will result in an outflow of resources and whetherthe amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Internal and external counsels aregenerally part of the determination process. Due to new developments, it may be necessary, torecord a provision for an ongoing Legal proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously
F-63
recognized provision. Upon resolution of a L egal proceeding, Siemens Energy may incur charges in
excess of the recorded provisions for such matters. The outcome of Legal proceedings may have amaterial effect on Siemens Energy’s financial positi on, its results of operations and/or its cash flows.
Termination benefits – Termination benefits are provided as a result of an entity’s offer made
in order to encourage voluntary redundancy before the regular retirement date or from anentity’s decision to terminate the employment. Termination benefits in accordance with IAS 19,Employee Benefits, are recognized as a liability and an expense when the entity can no longerwithdraw the offer of those benefits.
Financial instruments – A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset
of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Based on theircontractual cash flow characteristics and the bus iness model they are held in, financial instruments
are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost,measured at fair value, loan commitments and credit guarantees and contract assets. Regular way
purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade date. Siemens Energy does notuse the option to designate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or lossat inception (fair value option). Initially, fi nancial instruments are recognized at fair value and net
of transaction costs, if not categorized at FVTPL. Subsequently, financial assets and liabilities aremeasured according to the category to which they are assigned to:
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) – Debt financial assets are
measured at FVTPL if the business model they are hel d in is not a hold-to-collect or a hold-and-sell
business model, or if their contractual cash flows d o not represent solely payments of principal and
interest. Equity instruments are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCI-option is elected.
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) – Are equity
instruments for which Siemens Energy irrevocably elects to present subsequent fair value changesin OCI at initial recognition of the instrument. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferredincome tax expenses, as well as gains and losses on the subsequent sale of the instruments arerecognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.
Financial assets measured at amortized cost – Loans, receivables and other debt instruments held
in a hold-to-collect business model with contractual cash flows that represent solely payments ofprincipal and interest are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method lessvaluation allowances for expected credit losses.
Valuation allowances are set up for expected credit losses, representing a forward-looking estimate
of future credit losses involving significant judgm ent. Expected credit loss is the gross carrying
amount less collateral, multiplied by the probability of default and a factor reflecting the loss in theevent of default. Valuation allowances are not recognized when the gross carrying amount issufficiently collateralized. Probabilities of default are mainly derived from internal rating grades. Asimplified approach is used to assess expected credit losses from trade receivables, lease receivablesand contract assets by applying their lifetime expected credit losses. Financial assets are written offas uncollectible if recovery appears unlikely. Generally, if the limitation period expired, when adebtor’s sworn statement of affairs is received, or when the receivable is not pursued due to itsminor value. Receivables are writte n off when bankruptcy proceedings close.
Cash and cash equivalents – Siemens Energy considers all highly liquid investments with less
than three months maturity from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.
A financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred
to another party. Significant modifications of c ontractual terms of a financial asset measured at
amortized cost result in derecognition and recogni tion of a new financial asset; for insignificant
modifications, the carrying amount of the fi nancial asset is adjusted without derecognition.
Credit guarantees – Credit guarantees are recognized at the higher of consideration received
for granting the guarantee and expected credit losses determined.
Financial liabilities – Except for derivative financial instruments, Siemens Energy measures
financial liabilities at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
F-64
Derivative financial instruments – Derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency
exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts are measured at fair value unless they aredesignated as hedging instruments, for which hedge accounting is applied. Changes in the fairvalue of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or, in the case of acash flow hedge, in line item Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes (applicabledeferred income tax). Certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are alsoaccounted for separately as derivatives.
Cash flow hedges – The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments
designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income, net ofincome taxes, and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. Amountsaccumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedgeditem affects net income.
Share-based payment – Share-based payment awards at Siemens Energy are predominately
classified as cash-settled to fulfill the specific requirements for share-based payment transactionsamong group entities. Fair value is measured at grant date, updated each quarter and expensedover the vesting period. Fair value is determined as the market price of Siemens AG shares,considering dividends during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to and marketconditions and non-vesting conditions, if applicable.
Expenses related to share-based payment awards for Siemens Energy employees, which were
granted by a Siemens Group entity and for which the contractual obligation to settle the shared-based payment liability has not been transferred to Siemens Energy as well as Share-basedpayments related to Siemens Gamesa shares, are included in the Combined Financial Statementsas equity-settled awards.
Prior-year’s information – The presentation of certain prior-year’s information has been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Recently adopted Accounting Pronouncements
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, was adopted retrospectively as of October 1, 2018. Fiscal 2018
information is measured under IAS 39; amounts are not adjusted in accordance with IFRS 9transitional provisions. The adoption had no material impact on the Combined FinancialStatements. IFRS 9 changed the classification of financial instruments: Equity instruments wereassessed on a case-by-case basis whether measurement at FVOCI or FVTPL applies. Debtinstruments not satisfying the solely payments of principal and interest criterion were reclassifiedfrom loans and receivables and available-for-sale to FVTPL.
In fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, under IAS 39, loans and receivables were measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method less any impairment loss. Available-for-sale financialassets were measured at fair value, if reliably measurable, and changes in fair value other thanimpairment losses were recognized in Other comprehensive income, net of income taxes; uponderecognition, gains and losses accumulated in Equity were reclassified. If fair value was notreliably measurable, available-for-sale assets were measured at cost. Impairments were based onthe incurred loss model.

Recent accounting pronouncements, not yet adopted
The following pronouncements, issued by the IASB, are not yet effective and have not yet been
adopted by Siemens Energy:
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16, Leases. IFRS 16 eliminates the current classification
model for lessee’s lease contracts as either operating or finance leases and, instead, introduces asingle lessee accounting model requiring lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and leaseliabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months. This brings the previous off-balanceleases on the balance sheet in a manner largely comparable to current finance lease accounting.IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Siemens Energy willadopt the standard for the fiscal year beginning as of October 1, 2019, by applying the modifiedretrospective approach, i.e. comparative figures for the preceding year will not be adjusted. It isintended to use most of the simplifications available under IFRS 16. Currently, it is expected thatthe majority of the transition effect relates to real estate leased by Siemens Energy. Regardingthe adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, Siemens Energy expects an increase of approximately 2% in Totalassets as well as in Total liabilities and equity as of October 1, 2019 (opening balance sheet). Inaddition, straight-line operating lease expenses will be replaced by depreciation expenses onright-of-use assets and interest expenses on lease liabilities.
In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. The
interpretation clarifies the recognition and measurement requirements when there is uncertaintyover income tax treatments. In assessing the uncertainty, an entity shall consider whether it isprobable that a taxation authority will accept or revise the uncertain tax treatment. IFRIC 23 iseffective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, while earlierapplication is permitted. Siemens Energy expects no material impact due to the adoption ofIFRIC 23.
NOTE 3 Acquisition and disposals
Acquisition
In April 2017, Siemens AG contributed its wind power business, including service, into the
publicly listed company Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica, S. A., Spain (Gamesa), and in returnreceived newly issued shares of the combined entity Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S. A.,Spain (SGRE). The two businesses are highly complementary regarding global footprint, existingproduct portfolios and technologies. After the acquisition, Siemens AG as majority shareholderholds 59% of the shares of the combined entity, which are part of the combination scope ofSiemens Energy. As part of the merger, Siemens AG paid €999 million in cash which was
distributed to the Gamesa shareholders (without Siemens AG) following the completion of themerger.
The consideration transferred by Siemens AG equals 59% of Gamesa’s market capitalization at
closing of the merger and amounts to €3,669 million. The purchase price allocation as of the
acquisition date resulted in:
Other intangible assets €2,490 million, Property, plant and equipment €610 million, Trade and
other receivables €1,073 million, Cash and cash equivalent €1,004 million, Inventories
€817 million, Contract asses €641 million, Other financial assets €373 million (current and
non-current), Other current assets €206 million, Investments accounted for using the equity
method €74 million, Current income tax assets €179 million, Deferred tax assets €478 million,
Long-term debt €656 million, Provisions €1,554 million (current and non-current), Other financial
liabilities €217 million, Short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt €366 million,
Trade payables €1,780 million, Contract liabilities €779 million, Current income tax liabilities
€118 million, Other current liabilities €217 million, Other current financial liabilities
€1,068 million and Deferred tax liabilities €798 million. Intangible assets mainly relate to
technology of €1,147 million and customer relationships and trademarks of €1,343 million and is
substantially being amortized over a period of 6 to 20 years. The gross contractual amount of thetrade and other receivables acquired is €1,136 million. Goodwill amounts to €2,857 million and
F-66
comprises intangible assets that are not separable such as employee know-how and expected
synergy effects from highly complementary businesses entailing an enhanced market position(including anticipated cost savings mainly in R & D, procurement and administration as well asrevenue synergies).
Effects on equity resulting from this transaction are included in line Other changes. Including
earnings effects from purchase price allocation and integration costs, the acquired businesscontributed revenue of €1,659 million and a net income of €(209) million to Siemens Energy for
the period from acquisition to September 30, 2017. Goodwill is allocated within the segmentSGRE to the units Wind Turbines and Operation and Maintenance. The non-controlling interestsof 41% amount to €567 million at the acquisition date and are measured at the proportionate
share in the recognized amounts of the acquired net assets (excluding goodwill).
Disposals
In October 2017, Siemens Energy sold its Single Stage and Wastewater Compressor business and its
small steam turbine business, both including service for €193 million in cash and cash equivalents.
The following material asset and liability positions were derecognized in the course of the sale ofthe business: Goodwill €44 million, Property, plant and equipment €25 million, Trade and other
receivables €22 million, Cash and cash equivalents €10 million, Inventories €14 million, Contract
assets €20 million, Trade payables €11 million, Contract liabilities €14 million and Other current
liabilities €13 million. The sale resulted in a gain of €86 million in fiscal 2018 which was
recognized in the line item Other operating income and presented in the Gas and Power segment.The corresponding assets and liabilities were previously classified as held-for-sale.
In April 2018, Siemens Energy sold part of its government business and US Navy Service Centersfor€174 million in cash and cash equivalents. The following material asset positions were
derecognized in the course of the sale of the business: Goodwill €29 million, Other intangible
assets €22 million and Inventories €35 million. The sale resulted in a gain of €79 million in fiscal
2018 which was recognized in the line item Other operating income and presented in the Gasand Power segment. The corresponding assets and liabilities were previously classified asheld-for-sale.
In October 2018, Siemens Energy sold its packaging and service of rotating equipment site in
Hengelo, Netherlands for €(58) million in cash and cash equivalents. The sale resulted in loss of
€54 million in fiscal 2019 which was recognized in the line item Other operating expense and
presented in the Gas and Power segment.

The facility includes a fully drawn term loan tranche of €500 million maturing in 2021 and a
revolving credit line tranche of €2,000 million maturing in 2023 with two one-year extension
options. As of September 30, 2019, €500 million (September 30, 2018: €700 million) have been
drawn. It may be used for general corporate purposes and to refinance outstanding debt.
In March and May 2019, SGRE signed new bilateral credit lines amounting to €512 million, of
which €412 million mature in 2020 and €100 million are extendable by tacit agreement until
2022, accruing an average interest rate of 0.33%. As of September 30, 2019, SGRE has not drawnany amount related to these credit lines.
As of September 30, 2019, SGRE has bilateral credit lines in India with annual maturities for an
amount of €304 million.
As of September 30, 2019, SGRE units had been granted loans and had drawn from credit
facilities that accounted for 23% of the total financing granted to them maturing between 2019and 2029 (September 30, 2018: 46% granted; maturing between 2018 and 2026, September 30,2017: 48% granted; maturing between 2017 and 2026).
As of September 30, 2017, SGRE was using loan agreements amounting to €424 million with
certain obligations as the compliance with financial ratios throughout the life of the agreementrelating to the capacity to generate resources in the operations, to the debt level and financialduties. Also, these arrangements established certain limits to the arrangement of additionalborrowings and to the distribution of dividends, as well as other conditions. Not meeting thesecontractual conditions would have enabled the banks to demand early repayment. As ofSeptember 30, 2017, the established financial ratios were met. As of September 30, 2019, andSeptember 30, 2018, these conditions do not longer apply.
NOTE 14 Provision for Pensions and similar obligations
Siemens Energy provides post-employment defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans toalmost all domestic employees and the majority of the foreign employees.
Defined benefit plans
Defined benefit plans which are open to new entrants are based predominantly on contributions
made by Siemens Group. Only to a certain extent, those plans are affected by longevity, inflationand compensation increases and take into account country-specific differences. Siemens Energy’smajor plans respectively are or will be funded with assets in segregated entities. In accordancewith local laws and bilateral agreements with benefit trusts (trust agreement) those plans aremanaged in the interest of the beneficiaries. Between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2019 the defined
F-77
benefit plans cover an average number of 52,000 participants, including 43,000 actives, 3,000
deferreds with vested benefits and 6,000 retirees and surviving dependents in around 50countries.
Where Siemens Energy employees participate in Siemens Group’s pension plans and the
respective pension trusts, Siemens Energy and Siemens Group bear the financial impact frompension obligations related to the respective employees. As the majority of the Siemens Energypension liabilities derives from three major countries, the pension landscape in these threecountries is described in detail below.
Germany:
In Germany, pension benefits are provided through the following plans: BSAV (Beitragsorientierte
Siemens Altersversorgung), closed legacy plans which exclude future benefit increases as well asdeferred compensation plans. The majority of active employees participate in the BSAV. Thosebenefits are predominantly based on notional contributions and their respective asset returns,subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the employer. At inception of the BSAV, benefitsprovided under the legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects ofcompensation increases. However, the legacy plans still expose Siemens Energy to investment risk,interest rate risk and longevity risk. The pension plans are funded via contractual trustarrangements (CTA). In Germany, no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply.
For deferred compensation plans, plan assets have been allocated to Siemens Energy and aretherefore included in the numbers below. However, no plan assets have been allocatedto Siemens Energy for the BSAV and the legacy plans. For further details please also refer to
Note 27 – Subsequent event.
U.S.:
In the US, Siemens Energy currently participates in the defined benefit plans sponsored by
Siemens Corporation, which for the most part have been frozen to new entrants and to futurebenefit accruals, except for interest credits on cash balance accounts. The pension plans aresubject to the funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974as amended, (ERISA). There is a regulatory requirement to maintain a minimum funding level of80% in defined benefit plans in order to avoid benefit restrictions. At its discretion, thesponsoring employers may contribute in excess of this regulatory requirement. Annualcontributions are calculated by independent actuaries. For all funded US pension plans, planassets have been allocated to Siemens Energy.
U.K.:
Pension benefits are mainly offered through the VA Tech U.K. Pension Scheme. The Scheme
provides benefits on retirement and death of its members and is closed to future accruals. Therequired funding is determined by a funding valuation carried out every third year based onlegal requirements. From April 2013 the Trustee arranged investments in insurance policiescovering pensions in payment due to members, which significantly reduced the longevity andinvestment risks for the Scheme and provided additional security for members.
Basis for allocation of Siemens Energy pension plans administrated by Siemens Group
During the periods presented, Siemens Energy employees in most countries participated in
Siemens Group’s pension plans and the respective pension trusts. For these plans, pensionbenefits are administrated by Siemens Group.
The defined benefit obligation and where possible corresponding plan asset values are calculated
on an individual employee basis. In all other cases, the plan assets have been split betweenSiemens Group and Siemens Energy based on the proportion of the Siemens Energy definedbenefit obligation to the Siemens Group defined benefit obligations.
The service costs are based on the service of the employees under the respective plans. The
interest costs and interest income are based on the allocated DBO and plan assets respectively.

The position “business combinations, disposals and other” include mainly transfers of deferred
vested members and retirees in Germany from Siemens Energy to Siemens AG.
The remeasurements comprise actuarial (gains) and losses resulting from:

Remeasurements in fiscal 2019 include an actuarial gain in the amount of €127 million due to a
change in financial assumptions in connection with payment options at the start of retirement inGermany.
Actuarial assumptions
The weighted-average discount rate used for the actuarial valuation of the DBO at period-end
was as follows:
Sep.30,
2019 2018 2017
Discount rate ....................................................... 2.1% 3.2% 3.1%
E U R ............................................................. 1.0% 2.1% 2.4%
U S D ............................................................. 3.1% 4.2% 3.5%
G B P ............................................................. 2.0% 2.9% 2.8%
The discount rate was derived from high-quality corporate bonds with an issuing volume of more
than 100 million units in the respective currency zones, which have been awarded an AA rating(or equivalent) by at least one of the three rating agencies Moody’s Investor Service, Standard &Poor’s Rating Services or Fitch Ratings.
Applied mortality tables are:

Since fiscal 2019 the mortality tables used in Germany (Siemens Bio 2017) are mainly derived
from data of the German Siemens AG population and to a lesser extent from data of the FederalStatistical Office in Germany by applying formulas in accordance with recognized actuarialstandards.

Sensitivity analysis
A one-half-percentage-point change of the above assumptions would result in the following
increase (decrease) of the DBO:

The DBO effect of a 10% reduction in mortality rates for all beneficiaries would be an increase of
€79 million as of September 30, 2019 (September 30, 2018: €62 million, September 30, 2017:
€71 million).
During the periods presented, sensitivity determinations apply the same methodology as applied
for the determination of the post-employment benefit obligation. Sensitivities reflect changes inthe DBO solely for the assumption changed.
Asset Liability Matching Strategies
A decline in the plans’ funded status due to adverse developments of plan assets and/or defined
benefit obligations resulting from changing parameters is considered a significant risk.Accordingly, a risk management concept aligned with the defined benefit obligations (AssetLiability Matching) was implemented. Risk management is based on a worldwide defined riskthreshold (Value at risk). The concept, the Value at risk and the asset development including theinvestment strategy are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing basis under consultation ofsenior external experts. Independent asset managers are selected based on quantitative andqualitative analyses, which include their performance and risk evaluation. Derivatives are used toreduce risks as part of risk management.
Disaggregation of plan assets
As the majority of participating entities’ plan assets are not separately managed, for those plans
the respective plan assets have been allocated to the different asset classes proportionally to theplan asset allocation of Siemens Group:

Virtually all equity securities have quoted prices in active markets. The fair value of fixed income
securities is based on prices provided by price service agencies. The fixed income securities aretraded in active markets and almost all fixed income securities are investment grade. Alternativeinvestments include hedge funds, private equity and real estate investments. Multi strategy fundsmainly comprise absolute return funds and diversified growth funds that invest in various assetclasses within a single fund and aim to stabilize return and reduce volatility. Derivativespredominantly consist of financial instruments for hedging interest rate risk and inflation risk.
Future cash flows
Employer contributions expected to be paid to defined benefit plans in fiscal 2020 are
€70 million. Over the next ten fiscal years, average annual benefit payments of €148 million are
expected as of September 30, 2019 (September 30, 2018: €117 million, September 30, 2017:
€116 million). The weighted average duration of the DBO for Siemens Energy defined benefit
plans was 14 years as of September 30, 2019 (September 30, 2018: 13 years, September 30, 2017:14 years).
Defined contribution plans and state plans
The amount recognized as expense for defined contribution plans amounts to €201 million in
fiscal 2019 (fiscal 2018: €208 million, fiscal 2017: €233 million). Contributions to state plans
amount to €431 million in fiscal 2019 (fiscal 2018: €399 million, fiscal 2017: €365 million).

NOTE 16 Equity
As stated in Note 1 – Basis of preparation , Siemens Energy was not a legal group for Consolidated
Financial Statements reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS 10, Consolidated FinancialStatements, in the periods presented. The equity was presented on the basis of the aggregationof the net assets of the Siemens Energy business under the control of Siemens AG and centrallymanaged by the Managing Board of Siemens AG.
Since the combined group does not show any subscribed capital, a presentation of earnings per
share in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per share, is not applicable.
Other changes
During the periods presented in the Combined Financial Statements, the line item Other changes
as included in the Combined Statements of Changes in Invested Equity mainly contains specificsin relation to the combination rules described in Note 1 – Basis of preparation . In fiscal 2017, the

NOTE 18 Legal proceedings
The following legal proceedings relate to the Siemens Energy Business.
Proceedings out of or in connection with alleged breaches of contract
Siemens AG is a member of a supplier consortium that has been contracted to construct the
nuclear power plant “Olkiluoto 3” in Finland for Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) on a turnkeybasis. The agreed completion date for the nuclear power plant was April 30, 2009. Siemens AG’sshare of the contract value is approximately 27%. The other member of the supplier consortiumis a further consortium consisting of Areva NP S.A.S. and its wholly owned subsidiary, ArevaGmbH. Completion of the power plant has been delayed for reasons which were in dispute. InDecember 2008, the supplier consortium filed a request for arbitration against TVO demandingan extension of the construction time, additional compensation, milestone payments, damagesand interest. TVO rejected the claims and asserted counterclaims against the supplier consortiumconsisting primarily of damages due to the delay, last updated to approximately €2.3 billion. The
supplier consortium’s monetary claims as last updated amounted to approximately €3.6 billion.
The amounts claimed by the parties did not cover the total period of delay. In November 2016 apartial award on certain preliminary questions identified for early treatment was issued. Afurther partial award on document handling issues was rendered in July 2017. In this furtherpartial award certain key facts underlying the claims regarding delay and disruption thatoccurred during project execution were decided in favor of TVO. Another partial award onproject management issues and the use of advanced construction methods was rendered inNovember 2017. While the Tribunal granted some of TVO’s requests, most of TVO’s materialallegations in this respect were dismissed or their decision was deferred to a later stage. None ofthe partial awards have dealt with the amounts claimed by the parties. A final arbitration awardon the merits of the claims and counterclaims was finally expected during the first half ofcalendar year 2018. In March 2018, the supplier consortium, Areva SA and TVO signed a globalsettlement agreement which finally settled all claims and counterclaims raised in the arbitrationagainst a lump sum payment of €450 million by Areva to TVO. In May 2018, the arbitral tribunal
declared the proceedings closed.
In March 2019, a Brazilian company asserted claims to pay an amount in a higher three-digit
million euro amount in local currency against a consortium of contractors and each member ofthe consortium, including Siemens Ltda., Brazil (“Siemens Ltda.”) in a lawsuit relating to theconstruction of a power plant in Brazil that was completed in 2016. The members of theconsortium are jointly and severally liable, Siemens Ltda.’s share in the consortium is below 3%.The consortium and its members defend themselves against the claim and for their part claimpayment in a lower three-digit million euro amount in local currency.

Proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations
In September 2011, the Israeli Antitrust Authority requested that Siemens AG present its legal
position regarding an alleged anti-competitive arrangement between April 1988 and April 2004in the field of gas-insulated switchgear. In September 2013, the Israeli Antitrust Authorityconcluded that Siemens AG was a party to an illegal restrictive arrangement regarding the Israeligas-insulated switchgear market between 1988 and 2004, with an interruption from October1999 to February 2002. The Company appealed against this decision in May 2014.
Based on the above mentioned conclusion of the Israeli Antitrust Authority, two electricity
consumer groups filed motions to certify a class action for cartel damages against a number ofcompanies including Siemens AG with an Israeli State Court in September 2013. One of the classactions has been dismissed by the court in fiscal year 2015. The remaining class action seekscompensation for alleged damages amounting to ILS 2.8 billion (September 30, 2019:€739 million, September 30, 2018: €665 million, September 30, 2017: €673 million). In addition,
the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) filed at the end of December 2013 with an Israeli State Courta separate ILS 3.8 billion (September 30, 2019: €997 million, September 30, 2018: €897 million,
September 30, 2017: €909 million) claim for damages against Siemens AG and other companies
that allegedly formed a cartel in the Israeli gas-insulated switchgear market. A settlementagreement concluded in December 2018 has been approved by the Israeli Court. This decision bythe Israeli Court is subject to appeal.
Since 2006, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) in Brazil conducted
investigations into possible antitrust behavior in the field of gas-insulated and air-insulatedswitchgear from the 1990’s to 2006. Siemens cooperated with the authorities. In February 2017,Siemens AG entered into a settlement agreement with CADE relating to alleged antitrustviolations in the field of gas-insulated switchgear for an amount in a low single-digit euro millionrange. In October 2017, Siemens Ltda. entered into a settlement agreement with CADE relatingto alleged antitrust violations in the field of air-insulated switchgear for an amount in a middouble-digit euro million range.
Siemens received credible information in 2017 that four gas turbines intended for a project in
Taman, Russia, which were delivered by OOO Siemens Gas Turbines Technologies (SGTT) to itscustomer OAO VO TechnoPromExport in summer of 2016 had been allegedly brought to Crimeaagainst contractual agreements with SGTT. Allegedly, these four gas turbines had been sold byOAO VO TechnoPromExport to OOO VO TechnoPromExport, had then been locally modified andmoved to Crimea, a location under sanctions. Siemens AG together with SGTT and SGTTseparately have filed lawsuits before the State Court of Moscow against OAO VOTechnoPromExport and OOO VO TechnoPromExport for the return of the gas turbines. The StateCourt of Moscow rejected the claims of Siemens AG and SGTT in both proceedings in fourinstances.
Additionally, the Hamburg public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against Siemens
employees in regard of alleged violations of the German Foreign Trade and Payments Act.Siemens cooperates with the authorities.
Siemens and Siemens Energy are involved in numerous legal proceedings in various jurisdictions.
These legal proceedings could result, in particular, in Siemens Energy being subject to payment ofdamages and punitive damages, equitable remedies or sanctions, fines or disgorgement of profit.In individual cases this may also lead amongst others to formal or informal exclusion fromtenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. In addition, further legalproceedings may be commenced or the scope of pending legal proceedings may be extended.Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates.
Some of these legal proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens Energy, which may
have material effects on its business activities as well as its financial position, results of operationsand cash flows.

to Siemens Group (except Payables to Siemens Group).
Fixed-rate and variable-rate receivables with a remaining term of more than twelve months are
evaluated by Siemens Energy based on parameters such as interest rates, specific country riskfactors, individual creditworthiness of the customer, and the risk characteristics of the financedproject. Based on this evaluation, allowances for these receivables are recognized.
The fair value of other non-derivative financial liabilities, loans from banks and other financial
indebtedness as well as obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cashflows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities (Level 2).
The following table allocates financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value to the

All derivative financial instruments of the company are grouped into Level 2 as of September 30,
2018 and September 30, 2017.
Fair values of derivative financial instruments are in accordance with the specific type of
instrument. Fair values of derivative interest rate contracts are estimated by discounting expectedfuture cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining term ofthe instrument. Fair values of foreign currency derivatives are based on forward exchange rates.No compensating effects from underlying transactions (e.g. firm commitments and forecasttransactions) are taken into consideration.
The fair value of equity instruments measured at fair value is either based on prices quoted in an
active market or estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market interest rates.The fair value of debt instruments is estimated by discounting future cash flows using currentmarket interest rates.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk management
Derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationshipRisks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, debt,
firm commitments and forecast transactions were centrally managed by Siemens CorporateTreasury of Siemens AG in favor of Siemens Energy.
Under this approach the risks are aggregated centrally, and various derivative financial
instruments, primarily foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and options,are utilized to minimize such risks. Such a strategy does not qualify for hedge accountingtreatment.
F-90
Cash flow hedges
Siemens Energy’s units apply hedge accounting to certain significant forecast transactions and
firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Particularly, Siemens Energy entered intoforeign currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of variability of future cash flows resultingfrom forecast sales and purchases as well as firm commitments. The risk is mainly related toforeign currency fluctuations between EUR/DKK, GBP/DKK and EUR/USD resulting from contractsfrom Siemens Energy’s operating units entering into long-term contracts. The following tablepresents the average rate of either a forward purchase or a forward sale for those foreigncurrencies together with the respective average remaining maturity:

Interest rate risk management
Project-related cash flow hedge
Siemens Energy applies cash flow hedge accounting to hedge the interest rate risk of a
forecasted sale of receivables that will originate from an infrastructure project in the U.S. Theproject, in which Siemens Energy participates together with Siemens Group segment SmartInfrastructure, schedules the origination of long-term receivables with a gross amount of€344 million and maturities between 2 and 22 years after PAC in 2022. Siemens Energy will
externally sell these receivables in 2022 shortly after their origination and hedges the discountthat will be charged by the external purchaser with a forward-starting interest rate swap. Theforward-starting interest rate swap fixes the applicable discount rate of the forecasted sale ofreceivables to 2.2787%.
NOTE 21 Financial risk management
Siemens Energy manages and controls its financial risks in accordance with Siemens Grouppolicies. During the periods presented, Siemens Energy (except SGRE business) delegatedresponsibilities to central functions of Siemens Group. Financial risk management for the SGREbusiness is done on Siemens Gamesa Group level.
Market risk
Increasing market fluctuations may result in significant earnings and cash flow volatility risk for
Siemens Energy. The Siemens Energy business as well as its investment and financing activities areaffected particularly by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. In order to optimizethe allocation of financial resources across Siemens Energy’s segments and entities, as well as toachieve its aims, Siemens Energy identifies, analyzes and manages the associated market risks.Siemens Energy seeks to manage and control these risks primarily through its regular operatingand financing activities and uses derivative financial instruments when deemed appropriate.
In order to quantify market risks Siemens Energy utilized a system based on Value at Risk
(“VaR”), which is also used for internal management of Siemens Group Corporate Treasuryactivities. The VaR figures are calculated based on historical volatilities and correlations of variousrisk factors, a ten days holding period, and a 99.5% confidence level.
Actual results that are included in the Combined Statements of Income or Combined Statements
of Comprehensive Income may differ substantially from VaR figures due to fundamental
F-91
conceptual differences. While the Combined Statements of Income and Combined Statements of
Comprehensive Income are prepared in accordance with IFRS, the VaR figures are the output of amodel with a purely financial perspective and represent the potential financial loss which will notbe exceeded within ten days with a probability of 99.5%. Although VaR is an important tool formeasuring market risk, the assumptions on which the model is based give rise to some limitationsincluding the following. A ten days holding period assumes that it is possible to dispose of theunderlying positions within this period. This may not be valid during continuing periods ofilliquid markets. A 99.5% confidence level means, that there is a 0.5% statistical probability thatlosses could exceed the calculated VaR. The use of historical data as a basis for estimating thestatistic behavior of the relevant markets and finally determining the possible range of thefuture outcomes on the basis of this statistic behavior may not always cover all possible scenarios,especially those of an exceptional nature.
Any market sensitive instruments, including equity and interest bearing investments related to
Siemens Energy pension plans are not included in the following quantitative and qualitativedisclosures.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk
Transaction riskEach Siemens Energy unit conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to
future cash flows denominated in a currency other than its functional currency is exposed to risksfrom changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the ordinary course of business SiemensEnergy entities are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly betweenthe euro and the Danish kroner, as well as between the Danish kroner and the British pound andbetween the U.S. dollar and the euro. Foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balancedby purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective currencies as well asproduction activities and other contributions along the value chain in the local markets.
The operating units are prohibited from borrowing or investing in foreign currencies on a
speculative basis. Financing from Siemens Group or investments of operating units are preferablycarried out in their functional currency or on a hedged basis.
According to the Siemens Group policy Siemens Energy units are responsible for recording,
assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. The net foreign currencyposition of Siemens Energy units serves as a central performance measure and has to be hedgedwithin a band of at least 75% but no more than 100%.
Generally, the Siemens Energy units conclude their hedging activities with Siemens Group. SGRE
units also conclude their hedging activities with international counterparties.
As of September 30, 2019, the VaR relating to foreign currency exchange rates was €10 million
(September 30, 2018: €9 million, September 30, 2017: €12 million). This VaR was calculated
under consideration of items of the Combined Statement of Financial Position in addition to firmcommitments which are denominated in foreign currencies, as well as foreign currencydenominated cash flows from forecast transactions for the following twelve months.
Translation risk
Many Siemens Energy units are located outside the Eurozone. Because the financial reporting
currency of Siemens Energy is the euro, the financial statements of these subsidiaries aretranslated into euro for the preparation of the Combined Financial Statements. To consider theeffects of foreign currency translation in the risk management, the general assumption is thatinvestments in foreign-based operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous.Effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amountsinto euro are reflected in the combined equity position.
F-92
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This risk arises whenever interest terms offinancial assets and liabilities are different. Siemens Energy’s exposure to the risk of changes inmarket interest rates relates in most parts to financial investments and borrowings to SiemensGroup via Siemens Treasury, mainly with fixed rates of interest. Long-term liabilities mainly relateto loans with Siemens Treasury (except SGRE business). SGRE mainly uses external sources tofinance parts of its operations, with either fixed or variable interest rates.
Siemens Energy (except SGRE business) is mainly financed by Siemens Treasury and interest rate
risk management is performed at the level of Siemens Group. Consequently, until the end offiscal 2019, Siemens Energy (except SGRE business) did not manage its interest rate risk actively.SGRE continuously analyses the split of external financing at variable and fixed rates to optimizeits interest rate risk exposure.
Siemens Energy also uses derivative financial instruments to perform a comprehensive interest
rate risk management when appropriate.
As of September 30, 2019, the VaR relating to the interest rate was €157 million (September 30,
2018: €57 million, September 30, 2017: €123 million). The changes were mainly driven by
changing interest rate volatilities for the US-dollar.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk results from Siemens Energy’s inability to meet its financial liabilities. In the periods
presented, Siemens Energy was largely financed by Siemens Group and invested excess liquidityusing Siemens Group’s cash pooling and cash management systems. Siemens Energy mitigatesliquidity risk by the implementation of effective working capital and cash management as well asthe arrangement of credit facilities with financial institutions.
The following table reflects Siemens Energy’s contractually fixed pay-offs for settlement,
repayments and interest. The disclosed expected undiscounted net cash outflows from derivativefinancial liabilities are determined based on each particular settlement date of an instrument andbased on the earliest date on which Siemens Energy could be required to pay. Cash outflows forfinancial liabilities (including interest) without fixed amount or timing are based on theconditions existing at September 30, 2019.

Credit risk
Credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in financial instruments if the contractual partner is
failing to discharge its obligations in full and on time or if the value of collateral declines.
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a
core competency of Siemens Energy’s risk management system. In this context, Siemens Energy isbound to the credit policy implemented by Siemens Group.
F-93
Siemens Group maintains a Credit Risk Intelligence Unit to which numerous operating units of
Siemens Energy regularly transfer business partner data as a basis for a centralized rating andcredit limit recommendation process. Due to the identification, quantification and activemanagement of credit risks, credit risk transparency is increased.
Ratings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating
methodologies, with information obtained from customers, external rating agencies, data serviceproviders and credit default experiences. The ratings used consider appropriate forward-lookinginformation significant to the specific financial instrument like expected changes in the obligor’sfinancial position, shareholders, management or operational risks, as well as broader forward-looking information, such as expected macroeconomic, industry-related and competitivedevelopments. A country-specific risk component derived from external country credit ratings isalso considered.
An exposure is considered defaulted if the obligor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit
obligations. A range of internally defined events trigger a default rating, including the openingof bankruptcy proceedings, receivables due past 90 days or a default rating by an external ratingagency.
To analyze and monitor credit risks, Siemens Energy applies various systems and processes. A
main element is a central IT application that processes data from operating units together withrating and default information and calculates an estimate which may be used as a basis forindividual bad debt provisions. Additionally, qualitative information is considered, to particularlyincorporate latest developments.
The carrying amount is the maximum exposure to a financial assets’ credit risk. Collateral reduces
the valuation allowance to the extent it mitigates credit risk. Collateral needs to be specific,identifiable and legally enforceable to be taken into account.
As of September 30, 2019, collateral of €97 million (September 30, 2018: €67 million,
September 30, 2017: €35 million) relate to financial assets measured at fair value. Those
collaterals are provided in connection with netting agreements for derivatives providingprotection from the risk of a counterparty’s insolvency. As of September 30, 2019, collateral heldfor financial assets measured at amortized cost are €333 million (September 30, 2018:
€372 million, September 30, 2017: €283 million), comprising letters of credit, guarantees and
credit insurance policies. As of September 30, 2019, collateral held for contract assets are€14 million (September 30, 2018: €30 million, September 30, 2017: €0 million), comprising letters
of credit (September 30, 2018: Guarantees).
Trade receivables of Siemens Energy units are generally rated internally; approximately 38% have
an investment grade rating and 62% have a non-investment grade rating. Contract Assetsgenerally show similar risk characteristics as trade receivables in operating units.
Amounts above do not represent economic credit risks, since they neither consider collateral held
nor valuation allowances already recognized.
NOTE 22 Share-based payments
Share-based payment awards may be settled in newly issued shares of capital stock of SiemensAG, in treasury shares or in cash. Share-based payment awards may forfeit if the employment ofthe beneficiary terminates prior to the expiration of the vesting period. At Siemens Group level,these share-based payment plans are predominantly designed and accounted for as equity-settled plans and to a limited extent as cash-settled plans.
In the Combined Financial Statements of Siemens Energy, the classification of share-based
payment plans has been adjusted to fulfill the specific requirements for share-based paymenttransactions among group entities. In most cases, Siemens Energy carries the contractualobligation against its employees to settle the share-based payment transactions at the end of thevesting period. Consequently, Siemens Energy accounts for these share-based payment plans ascash-settled plans.
F-94
The carrying amount of liabilities from share-based payment transactions, included in the line
item Other liabilities and Other current liabilities in the Combined Financial Statements, is
€100 million as of September 30, 2019 (September 30, 2018: €118 million, September 30, 2017:
€185 million). Total pretax expense for share-based payment amounted to €44 million for the
year ended September 30, 2019 (September 30, 2018: €87 million, September 30, 2017:
€129 million).
For information on share-based payments to related individuals refer to Note 26 – Related party

Stock Awards
Siemens Energy grants stock awards to members of the senior management, and other eligible
employees. Stock awards are subject to a restriction period of about four years and entitle thebeneficiary to receive Siemens AG shares without payment of consideration following therestriction period.
Stock awards are tied to performance criteria of Siemens AG. The annual target amount for stock
awards can be bound to the average of earnings per share (EPS, basic) of the past three fiscalyears and/or to the share price performance of Siemens AG relative to the share priceperformance of five important competitors (SPAC) during the four-year restriction period. Thetarget attainment for the performance criteria SPAC ranges between 0% and 200%. For awardsgranted in fiscal 2019 settlement is in shares only corresponding to the actual target attainment.For awards granted prior to fiscal 2019, target outperformances in excess of 100% are settled incash, target attainments up to 100% are settled in shares. The vesting period is four years and forawards granted until fiscal 2014, five years.
In fiscal 2019, 729,417 stock awards were granted contingent upon attaining the prospective
performance-based target of Siemens AG stock relative to five competitors (fiscal 2018: 315,691stock awards, fiscal 2017: 361,746 stock awards). The fair value of these stock awards amountingto€33 million in fiscal 2019 (fiscal 2018: €23 million, fiscal 2017: €24 million), was calculated by
applying a valuation model. In fiscal 2019 inputs to that model include an expected weightedvolatility of Siemens AG shares of 21.73% (fiscal 2018: 22.17%, fiscal 2017: 22.79%) and a marketprice of €98.92 per Siemens AG share (fiscal 2018: €114.80, fiscal 2017: €107.95). Expected
volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities. The model applies a risk-freeinterest rate of up to 0.16% in fiscal 2019 (fiscal 2018: up to 0.05%, fiscal 2017: up to 0.03%) andan expected dividend yield of 3.84% in fiscal 2019 (fiscal 2018: 3.23%, fiscal 2017: 3.33%).Assumptions concerning share price correlations were determined by reference to historiccorrelations.
Furthermore, during fiscal 2019, 68,302 stock awards were granted to members of the senior
management, and other eligible employees for extraordinary achievements based on a specialallocation from the CEO of the Siemens Group (fiscal 2018: 49,950 stock awards, fiscal 2017:37,481 stock awards). These stock awards are subject to a restriction period of about four years.The fair value amounts to €5 million in fiscal 2019 (fiscal 2018: €5 million, fiscal 2017:
€4 million).
Changes in the number of stock awards held by members of the senior management, and other
eligible employees are:

In fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively Siemens AG issued a new tranche under each of the
plans of the Share Matching Program.
Share Matching Plan
Under the Share Matching Plan senior managers may invest a specified part of their variable
compensation in Siemens AG shares (investment shares). The shares are purchased at the marketprice at a predetermined date in the second quarter. Plan participants receive the right to receiveone Siemens AG share without payment of consideration (matching share) for every threeinvestment shares continuously held over a period of about three years (vesting period) providedthe plan participant has been continuously employed by Siemens Group including SiemensEnergy until the end of the vesting period.
Monthly Investment Plan
Under the Monthly Investment Plan employees other than senior managers may invest a specified
part of their compensation in Siemens AG shares on a monthly basis over a period of twelvemonths. Shares are purchased at market price at a predetermined date once a month. If theManaging Board of Siemens AG decides that shares acquired under the Monthly Investment Planare transferred to the Share Matching Plan, plan participants will receive the right to matchingshares under the same conditions applying to the Share Matching Plan described above with avesting period of about two years since fiscal 2016 (fiscal 2015: about three years). The ManagingBoard of Siemens AG decided that shares acquired under the tranches issued in fiscal 2018, 2017and 2016 are transferred to the Share Matching Plan as of February 2019, February 2018 andFebruary 2017, respectively.
Base Share Program

Description of reportable segments
Siemens Energy has two reportable segments: Gas and Power, which offers a broad spectrum of products and solutions for the generation of
energy, along the entire value chain in the oil and gas industry and the construction andoperation of power transmission networks;
 Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE), which offers on- and offshore wind turbines as
well as services throughout the whole lifecycle of wind turbines.
For purposes of preparing these Combined Financial Statements, the segment reporting is
applied retrospectively to the periods presented as the new reporting structure did not exist inthe past.
Reconciliation to Combined Financial Statements
Real Estate Services – manages segment Gas and Power’s real estate business portfolio, operates
the properties, and is responsible for building projects and the purchase and sale of real estate.
Pension – includes the centrally carried income (expense) related to pension obligations not
allocated to the segments as well as the centrally managed pension assets and liabilities.
Eliminations, Treasury and other central items – comprise consolidation of transactions between
the segments, treasury activities and certain reconciliation and reclassification. It also includesinterest income and expense, such as, for example, interest not allocated to segments andinterest related to treasury activities.
Measurement – Segments
Accounting policies for Segment information are generally the same as those used for the
Combined Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are based on market prices.
Revenue
Revenue includes revenue from contracts with customers. All segments recognize revenue
predominantly over time due to the nature of their long-term contracts.
Adjusted EBITA
Siemens Energy’s management is responsible for assessing the performance of the segments
(chief operating decision maker). The profitability measure of the segments is earnings beforefinancing interest and certain pension costs, income taxes and amortization expenses ofintangible assets acquired in business combinations as determined by the chief operating decisionmaker (Adjusted EBITA).
F-99
Financing interest excluded from Adjusted EBITA is any interest income or expense other than
interest income related to receivables from customers, from cash allocated to the segments andinterest expenses on payables to suppliers. Financing interest is excluded from Adjusted EBITAbecause decision-making regarding financing is typically made at the corporate level.
Decisions on essential pension items are made centrally. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITA primarily
includes amounts related to service cost of pension plans only, while all other regularly recurringpension related costs are included in reconciliations in line item Centrally carried pensionexpense.
Income taxes are excluded from Adjusted EBITA since income tax is subject to legal structures,
which typically do not correspond to the structure of the segments. Costs for support functionsare primarily allocated to the segments.
Adjusted EBITA for Siemens Energy (i.e. Total Segments Adjusted EBITA plus elements of Real
Estate Services, Pension as well as Eliminations, Treasury and other central items that meet thedefinition of Adjusted EBITA) amounts to €1,025 million in fiscal 2019 (fiscal 2018: €864 million,
fiscal 2017: €1,991 million). Adjusted EBITA for Siemens Energy also includes interest income and
expenses on pension-related assets and liabilities.
Asset measurement principles
Management determined Assets (Net capital employed) as a measure to assess capital intensity of
the segments. Its definition corresponds to the Adjusted EBITA measure except for amortizationexpenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations which are not part of AdjustedEBITA, however, the related intangible assets are included in the segments’ Assets. SegmentAssets is based on Total assets of the Combined Statements of Financial Position, primarilyexcluding financing receivables from Siemens Group, tax related assets and assets of discontinuedoperations, since the corresponding positions are excluded from Adjusted EBITA. The remainingassets are reduced by non-interest-bearing liabilities other than tax related liabilities, e.g. tradepayables and contract liabilities, to derive Assets. Assets of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energyinclude real estate, while real estate of Gas and Power is carried centrally at Real Estate Services.
Orders
Orders are determined principally as estimated revenue of accepted purchase orders for which
enforceable rights and obligations exist as well as subsequent order value changes andadjustments, excluding letters of intent. To determine orders, Siemens Energy considerstermination rights and customer’s creditworthiness.
As of September 30, 2019 order backlog totaled €77 billion (September 30, 2018: €71 billion);
thereof Gas and Power €52 billion (September 30, 2018: €48 billion) and Siemens Gamesa
Renewable Energy €26 billion (September 30, 2018: €23 billion). As of September 30, 2019,
Siemens Energy expects to convert approximately €23 billion of the order backlog into revenue
within one year (September 30, 2018: €22 billion), thereof Gas and Power approximately
€13 billion (September 30, 2018: €13 billion) and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy
approximately €9 billion (September 30, 2018: €9 billion).
Free cash flow definition
Free cash flow of the segments constitutes cash flows from operating activities less additions to
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. It excludes financing interest, except forcases where interest on qualifying assets is capitalized or classified as contract costs; it alsoexcludes income tax as well as certain other payments and proceeds.
Amortization, depreciation and impairments
Amortization, depreciation and impairments includes depreciation and impairments of property,
plant and equipment as well as amortization and impairments of intangible assets each net ofreversals of impairment.

NOTE 27 Subsequent events
Carve-out process
In the period after the reporting date but prior to the issuance of the Combined Financial
Statements, activities that had not been conducted by separate companies have been transferredto separate legal entities either by carving out the Siemens Energy businesses or by carving outthe businesses within the legal entities that remain with Siemens Group (reverse carve-out). As ofthe issuance of the Combined Financial Statements, the carve-out process has been completed inall countries except for Bangladesh, Egypt, Japan, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi-Arabia.
Transfer of Real Estate Assets and other centrally managed items
Certain assets and centrally managed items (mainly Real Estate previously leased by Siemens
Energy from Siemens Real Estate and reflected as such in the Combined Financial Statements)have been transferred to Siemens Energy in line with the legal reorganization. Managementexpects that the total book value of Real Estate assets transferred to Siemens Energy after thereporting upon completion of all carve outs will amount to a mid three-digit million euro figure.
Deferred taxes
In several countries, the legal carve out triggered taxable income on capital gains if the local
purchase price exceeded the book value of the Siemens Energy business. In line with the separatetax return approach, no income tax expense will be shown in the Combined Financial Statementsfor fiscal 2020 for these transactions. However, management expects that the change of therelated assets and liabilities’ tax base and related temporary differences following carve out willlead to an increase in deferred tax assets of Siemens Energy by a low to mid three-digit millioneuro figure.
Legal proceedings in reverse carve-out countries
In some countries, the separation of Siemens Energy from Siemens Group was executed by way of
a reverse carve-out, i.e. the businesses within a regional company that shall remain with SiemensGroup were transferred out of such a regional company into a newly established Siemens Grouplegal entity.
As a result, legal proceedings against such regional company arising in connection with business
activities that were previously conducted by such regional company and that do not pertain tothe Energy business will remain with such regional company, which is now part of SiemensEnergy. Siemens Energy and Siemens Group have reached agreements to allocate the resultingfinancial risks in accordance with the separation of the business activities. However, it cannot beexcluded at this stage that, as a result of those legal proceedings, such regional company mightalso be (temporarily or permanently) barred from conducting certain or any business in therespective region, or even be dissolved.
These statements also apply to legal proceedings in Brazil, inter alia resulting out of Siemens’
businesses transferred into newly established Siemens Group legal entities (such as SiemensInfraestrutura e Indústria Ltda., Siemens Mobility Ltda., Siemens Healthcare Diagnósticos S.A.).These legal proceedings remain with Siemens Energy’s subsidiary in Brazil and include amongothers the following legal proceedings:
In May 2013, Siemens Ltda., Brazil (“Siemens Ltda.”) entered into a leniency agreement with the
Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) and other relevant Brazilian authoritiesrelating to possible antitrust violations in connection with alleged anticompetitive irregularitiesin metro and urban train projects, in which Siemens Ltda. and partially Siemens AG, as well as anumber of other companies participated as contractor. In July 2019, CADE completed theadministrative proceedings which started in May 2014, confirming the reported misconduct. Dueto its cooperation, Siemens was granted full immunity from administrative fines for themisconduct. In connection with the above mentioned metro and urban train projects, several
F-106
Brazilian authorities continue to investigate alleged criminal acts (corruptive payments, anti-
competitive conduct, undue influence on public tenders).
In March 2014, Siemens was informed that in connection with the above mentioned metro and
urban train projects the Public Prosecutor’s Office São Paulo requested to initiate criminalproceedings as regards alleged violations of Brazilian antitrust law against a number ofindividuals including current and former Siemens employees. The proceedings are continuing; thePublic Prosecutor’s Office São Paulo has appealed all decisions where the courts denied openingcriminal trials.
In May 2014, the Public Affairs Office (Ministério Público) São Paulo initiated a lawsuit against
Siemens Ltda. as well as other companies and several individuals claiming, inter alia, damages inan amount of BRL 2.5 billion (September 30, 2019: €552 million, September 30, 2018:
€537 million, September 30, 2017: €665 million) plus adjustments for inflation and related
interest in relation to train refurbishment contracts entered into between 2008 and 2011. InJanuary 2015, the district court of São Paulo admitted a lawsuit of the State of São Paulo andtwo customers against Siemens Ltda., Siemens AG and other companies and individuals claimingdamages in an unspecified amount. In March 2015, the district court of São Paulo admitted alawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Ministério Público) São Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and othercompanies claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL 487 million (September 30, 2019:€108 million, September 30, 2018: €105 million, September 30, 2017: €130 million) plus
adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train maintenance contracts enteredinto in 2000 and 2002. In September 2015, the district court of São Paulo admitted anotherlawsuit of the Public Affairs Office (Ministério Público) São Paulo against Siemens Ltda. and othercompanies claiming, inter alia, damages in an amount of BRL 918 million (September 30, 2019:€203 million, September 30, 2018: €197 million, September 30, 2017: €244 million) plus
adjustments for inflation and related interest in relation to train maintenance contracts enteredinto in 2006 and 2007. Siemens is defending itself against these actions. It cannot be excludedthat further significant damage claims will be brought by customers or the state against Siemens.
In June 2015, Siemens Ltda. appealed to the Supreme Court against a decision of a previous court
to suspend Siemens Ltda. from participating in public tenders and signing contracts with publicadministrations in Brazil for a five year term based on alleged irregularities in calendar year 1999and 2004 in public tenders with the Brazilian Postal authority. In July 2015, the court suspendedenforcement of the debarment decision. In February 2018, the appeal of Siemens Ltda. wasrejected. Siemens Ltda. has introduced another remedy against the decision. In June 2018, thecourt accepted Siemens’ appeal and declared the earlier instance decision as void. In February2018, the Public Affairs Office (Ministério Público) Brasilia filed a lawsuit based on the same setof alleged irregularities in calendar years 1999 and 2004 in public tenders with the BrazilianPostal authority, mainly claiming the exclusion of Siemens Ltda. from public tenders for a tenyear term. Siemens Ltda. is defending itself against the lawsuit. Siemens Ltda. is currently notexcluded from participating in public tenders.
Changes in pension-related assets and liabilities
In most countries Siemens Energy employees historically participated in the Siemens Group
pension plans. For these plans, pension benefits are administered by the Siemens Group, but theassets and liabilities are separated for each legal entity. As a result of the carve-out, most of theplan assets and obligations relating to Siemens Energy’s employees have been transferred toseparate Siemens Energy entities and pension plans and pension trusts have or will be transferredto Siemens Energy prior to spin-off.
In Germany, the Siemens Group provides pension benefits through the following plans: BSAV
(Beitragsorientierte Siemens Altersversorgung), closed legacy plans and deferred compensation.Funding for such plans is currently provided via contractual trust arrangements (“CTAs”). Inrelation to Siemens Energy, Siemens Gas & Power GmbH & Co. KG has set up a CTA which acts asthe pension trust (the “GP Trust”) for Siemens Energy’s German entities. Siemens Gas & PowerGmbH & Co. KG acts as sole trustor for the BSAV and the legacy plans, while for the deferred
F-107
compensation plans the participating Group entities are acting as trustor. For the BSAV and the
legacy plans this CTA has been funded with assets that had a fair value of approximately€915 million as at transfer date (January 2, 2020) and resulted in an equivalent increase in
Siemens Energy’s plan assets from that date.
Formation and future funding of the Siemens Energy Group
In the period after the reporting date but prior to the issuance of the Combined Financial
Statements, further transactions have occurred in connection with the formation as well asfuture funding of the Siemens Energy Group. The process is materially completed as of theissuance date of the Combined Financial Statements.
In May 2015, Siemens Group provided a USD loan to its subsidiary Dresser Rand Group Inc.
maturing in May 2045 to finance the acquisition of Dresser Rand – partially reimbursed in fiscal2019. For further details please also refer to Note 26 – Related party transactions . In the context
of the future funding, the remainder amounting to €1,571 million has been terminated in
February 2020. The termination did not have an impact on the income statement.
Senvion
In January 2020, SGRE reported the acquisition of a 100% interest in Senvion Deutschland GmbH,
Germany, including the carved-out European onshore service business of Senvion, relatedIntellectual Property as well as additional assets.
On April 30, 2020, SGRE closed the acquisition of all the shares in Ria Blades, S.A., Portugal, entity
which owns and operates the business of the wind turbine blades production facility in Vagos(Portugal) and certain additional assets associated to said business. The acquisition is in line withSGRE’s strategy to grow its multibrand service business, its production capacities and strengthensSGRE’s competitive position in Europe.
Acquisition of Iberdrola’s stake in SGRE
In February 2020, Siemens AG acquired Iberdrola S.A.’s 8.1% stake in SGRE. Consequently,
Siemens Energy will hold about 67% of the voting rights at SGRE after completion of theformation of the Siemens Energy Group.
Coronavirus (Corona)
Siemens Energy’s business and economic environment is adversely affected by the pandemic
coronavirus spread, though certain mitigating effects may arise due to the various measurestaken by Governments or States globally, including favorable financial support. As the outbreakcontinues to evolve, it is challenging to predict its duration and its magnitude of impacts onassets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows. Siemens Energy’s evaluation is based onexisting knowledge and best information available and the assumption that the currentcoronavirus situation is of no long-term duration. Corona related impacts on Siemens Energy mayinter alia result from interest rate adjustments in various countries, increasing volatility in foreigncurrency exchange rates, deteriorating creditworthiness, credit default or delayed payments,delays in order placements as well as in executing orders and contracts, termination of contracts,adjusted or modified revenue and cost patterns, limited usage of assets, volatility in financial and
commodity markets, limited or no access to customer facilities and hardship in preparing
predictions and forecasts due to uncertainties in amount and timing of cash flows. Those factorsmay impact fair value and carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, amount and timing of resultsof operations and cash flows.
On April 21, 2020, SGRE, released an ad hoc notification withdrawing its financial guidance for
fiscal 2020 due to the uncertainty associated with Corona, which is compounding challenges inIndia and Northern Europe.
F-108
Brexit
The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) ceased to be an EU member on January 31, 2020. The trading
relationship will remain the same until December 31, 2020. Negotiations determining theconditions of the future trading relationship between the EU and the U.K. are currently ongoing.If the EU and the U.K. fail to conclude a trading framework which provides for trading termssubstantially similar to the current terms, this may materially affect our business operations andresults.
Changes of the Siemens Energy Management Board
On March 19, 2020, the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG decided in its extraordinary meeting, to
appoint Christian Bruch (49), who was Executive Vice President of Linde plc and CEO of LindeEngineering, to be the designated CEO of Siemens Energy, effective May 1, 2020. Maria Ferraro(46), who was CFO of the Siemens segment Digital Industries, has been appointed the designatedCFO of Siemens Energy, effective May 1, 2020. Michael Sen and Klaus Patzak, Siemens Energy’sformer designated CEO and CFO, are leaving the company by mutual agreement.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORTTo Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, Berlin and MunichOpinionWe have audited the combined financial statements of the Siemens Energy business (entirety of
entities and business activities included in the combined financial statements, together “SiemensEnergy”), which comprise the combined statements of income, combined statements ofcomprehensive income, combined statements of financial position, combined statements of cashflows, combined statements of changes in invested equity and the notes to the combinedfinancial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, for the fiscal yearsfrom October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019, October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018 andOctober 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017.
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the accompanying
combined financial statements comply, in all material respects, with International FinancialReporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and, in compliance withthese requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and financial position ofSiemens Energy as of September 30, 2019, September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 and itsfinancial performance for the fiscal years from October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019, October 1,2017 to September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017.
Pursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB (“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code), we
declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of thecombined financial statements.
Basis for the opinion
We conducted our audit of the combined financial statements in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB
and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Auditspromulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany)(IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the“Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the combined financial statements” section of ourauditor’s report. We are independent of the entirety of entities and business activities included inthe combined financial statements in accordance with the requirements of German commercialand professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities inaccordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained issufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the combined financialstatements.
Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the combined financial
statements
Management of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft is responsible for the preparation of the combined
financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU andthat the combined financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true andfair view of the assets and liabilities, financial position and financial performance of SiemensEnergy. In addition, management of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft is responsible for such internalcontrol as management has determined necessary to enable the preparation of combinedfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
F-142
In preparing the combined financial statements, management of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft is
responsible for assessing Siemens Energy’s’ ability to continue as a going concern. It also has theresponsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition,management is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis ofaccounting unless there is an intention to liquidate Siemens Energy or to cease operations, orthere is no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Supervisory Board of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft is responsible for overseeing Siemens
Energy’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the combined financial statements.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the combined financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, andto issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion on the combined financial statements.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standardsfor Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the IDW will always detect a materialmisstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economicdecisions of users taken on the basis of these combined financial statements.
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
We also:
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the combined financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our auditopinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher thanfor one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the combined financial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, butnot for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the
reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures.
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s us e of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related toevents or conditions that may cast significant doubt on Siemens Energy’s ability to continue as a
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to drawattention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the combined financial statementsor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our audit opinion. Our conclusions are based on
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events orconditions may cause Siemens Energy to cease t o be able to continue as a going concern.
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the combined financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the combined financial statements present theunderlying transactions and events in a manner that the combined financial statements give atrue and fair view of the assets and liabilities, financial position and financial performance ofSiemens Energy in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
or business activities within Siemens Energy to express an audit opinion on the combinedfinancial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of theaudit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significantdeficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

Translation of the German language original concerning the audit of the original German
language annual financial statements.
Independent auditor’s reportTo Kyros 52 AktiengesellschaftOpinionWe have audited the annual financial statements of Kyros 52 Aktiengesellschaft (formerly:
Kyros 52 GmbH), Munich, which comprise the balance sheet as of 30 September 2019 and theincome statement for the fiscal year from 1 October 2018 to 30 September 2019.
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the accompanying annual
financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of Germancommercial law applicable to corporations and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilitiesand financial position of the Company as of 30 September 2019 and of its financial performancefor the fiscal year from 1 October 2018 to 30 September 2019 in compliance with German legallyrequired accounting principles and the partial application of the exemption for micro-entitiespursuant to Sec. 264 (1) Sentence 5 HGB [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code].
Pursuant to Sec. 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations
relating to the legal compliance of the annual financial statements.
Basis for the opinion
We conducted our audit of the annual financial statements in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and
in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Auditspromulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany](IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the“Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the annual financial statements” section of ourauditor’s report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the requirements ofGerman commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professionalresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence wehave obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the annualfinancial statements.
Responsibilities of the executive directors and the supervisory board for the annual financial
statements
The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the annual financial statements
that comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law applicableto business corporations, and that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view ofthe assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Company in compliancewith German legally required accounting principles and partially applying the exemption formicro-entities pursuant to Sec. 264 (1) Sentence 5 HGB. In addition, the executive directors areresponsible for such internal control as they, in accordance with German legally requiredaccounting principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of annual financialstatements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the annual financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility fordisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible forfinancial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, provided no actual or legalcircumstances conflict therewith.
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process for
the preparation of the annual financial statements.
F-148
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the annual financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue anauditor’s report that includes our opinion on the annual financial statements.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with Sec. 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standardsfor Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) willalways detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and areconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected toinfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual financial statements.
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
We also:
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for oneresulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the annual financial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, butnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of this system of theCompany.
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.
 Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty existsrelated to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability tocontinue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are requiredto draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the annual financialstatements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions arebased on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, futureevents or conditions may cause the Company to cease to be able to continue as a goingconcern.
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the annual financial statements present the underlyingtransactions and events in a manner that the annual financial statements give a true and fairview of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Company incompliance with German legally required accounting principles and partially applying theexemption for micro-entities pursuant to Sec. 264 (1) Sentence 5 HGB.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significantdeficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

22 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
22.1 Recent Developments
On July 2, 2020, S&P Global assigned a preliminary long-term investment grade rating of BBB
with a stable outlook to Siemens Energy. On the same day, S&P Global announced that the ratingof SGRE is foreseen to be upgraded to BBB upon Spin-Off Completion. Further, on August 6,2020, S&P Global assigned a preliminary long-term investment grade rating of BBB with a stableoutlook to SE Global GmbH & Co. KG. After Spin-Off Completion, the preliminary long-termratings are expected to become the long-term issuer credit ratings of Siemens Energy AG and SEGlobal GmbH & Co. KG.
On July 7, 2020, Siemens Energy concluded the Facility Agreement regarding a revolving credit
facility with a maximum total volume of €3 billion (see “ 12.9.1 Siemens Energy Facility
Agreement ”).
On July 22, 2020, the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of SGRE, S.A. ratified the
appointment of the SGRE’s CEO, Andreas Nauen. This meeting also passed a motion to reducethe size of the Board of Directors from 13 to 10 directors. On July 30, 2020, SGRE announced theappointment of Beatriz Puente as its incumbent Chief Financial Officer.
On September 1, 2020, we announced a restructuring of our Gas and Power segment’s Le Havre
facilities. The current plan foresees a headcount reduction of approximately 300, the closure ofproduction activities while keeping certain operations. We estimate to incur personnel and non-personnel costs of €70 million to €100 million associated with the transformation measures.
The announced plan is still subject to change, especially following the outcome of the just startednegotiations as per statutory requirements.
On September 1, 2020, the increase of the Company’s share capital from €100,000 by
€326,890,337 to €326,990,337 became effective. Furthermore, the Company expects that on
September 25, 2020 the increase of its share capital from €326,990,337 by €399,654,856 to
€726,645,193 by issuing the 399,654,856 New Shares will become effective. For more
information, see “ 16.2 Development of the Share Capital over the Last Three Years and in the
Course of the Spin-Off ”.
Increasing costs for project-related guarantees, primarily for guarantees issued by Siemens AG,
are expected to result in a cumulative catch-up effect that will negatively impact our profitabilityin the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020 with €75 million to €125 million.
In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020, we further expect: our Gas and Power segment to recognize extraordinary expenses of up to €50 million
predominantly due to write-offs and supplier related contracts, which were a consequence ofour strategic portfolio decision to streamline our offering of aero-derivative gas turbines witha view to increasing profitability in this field of business (see “ 12.3.3 Industrial Applications
Division ”); and
 our SGRE segment to recognize Special Items of €75 million to €125 million.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we expect to incur stand-alone costs of €75 million to
€100 million (for information regarding stand-alone costs incurred in the nine-month period
ended June 30, 2020, see “ 9.4.10.3 Special Items ”).
Most of our businesses continue to be negatively impacted by the deteriorated business
environment due to COVID-19 and/or low oil price levels. In our Gas and Power segment, theeffects varied widely. Our Gas and Power segment’s Transmission division experienced a negativeimpact mainly due to COVID-19 and oil price developments causing postponements of singlelarge orders as well as an intermediate reduction of production capacities at Transmissionfactories. Further, construction at some project sites was slowed down as travel restrictions andlock-down situations made site access difficult in some countries. Our Gas and Power segment’sGeneration division experienced a negative impact mainly due to COVID-19 caused by
O-1
postponements of orders due to project and service outage shifts. Furthermore, due to
construction site closures the division incurred prolongation costs. Our Gas and Power segment’sIndustrial Applications division experienced a negative impact mainly due to COVID-19 and oilprice developments causing delays in contract negotiations resulting in postponements of orders,lower transactional business and service outage shifts due to travel restrictions. The IndustrialApplications division experienced only a limited impact on its manufacturing facilities as themajority of its production sites remained open and operational. Our SGRE segment’s businesscontinues to be negatively impacted mainly by the effects of COVID-19, challenges in the onshorebusiness related to the slowdown of the Indian and Mexican markets and execution issues relatedto projects in Northern Europe.
Except as described above, between June 30, 2020 and the date of the Prospectus, there have
been no significant changes in our financial position.
22.2 Outlook
Immediately after the Listing, Siemens Energy AG will implement a share repurchase program aspart of which it may buy back Shares for up to €393 million, but not more than 72,664,519
Shares, until March 31, 2021. Depending on prevailing trading volumes and conditions, SiemensEnergy AG intends to repurchase a substantial part of the volume at the beginning of therepurchase period. For more information, see “ 17.6.1.2.4(3) Share Buy Back Program ”.
Upon Spin-Off Completion, Stock Entitlements of Beneficiaries of the Siemens Energy Group who
leave the Siemens Group as a direct consequence of the Spin-Off will be forfeited and suchBeneficiaries are entitled to cash compensation. As of August 26, 2020, we expect that the netcash outflow for the cash compensation to be paid by Siemens Energy Group will amount toapproximately €229 million, with a lower impact expected on Special Items since the vested
portion is already reflected in the balance sheet. For more information, see “ 17.2.3.5 Treatment
of Siemens Entitlements after the Spin-Off Completion ”.
We currently expect: our Group’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to
range from (1)% to 1% and 3% to 5%, respectively,
 our Segment’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items for the Gas and Power Segment in
the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to range from 0% to 2% and 3.5% to 5.5%, respectively, and
 our Segment’s Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items for the SGRE Segment in the fiscal
years 2020 and 2021 to range from (3)% to (1)% and 3% to 5%, respectively.
For the purpose of these forecasts, we assumed: our Group’s Revenue Growth Rate in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to range from (5)% to (2)%
and 2% to 12%, respectively,
 our Segment’s Revenue Growth Rate for the Gas and Power Segment in the fiscal years 2020
and 2021 to range from (5)% to (3)% and 2% to 11%, respectively, and
 our Segment’s Revenue Growth Rate for the SGRE Segment in the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to
range from (7)% to (2)% and 3% to 12%, respectively.
For additional information, see “ 10 Profit Forecast ”.
For the fiscal year 2023, we target our Adjusted EBITA Margin before Special Items in a range
from 6.5% to 8.5%. For the fiscal year 2023, we target Adjusted EBITA Margin before SpecialItems for our Gas and Power segment in a range from 6% to 8% and for our SGRE segment in arange from 8% to 10%.
In the mid-term, we target an Adjusted EBITA Margin of at least 8% and our revenue to grow
over a rolling three year average in a range from 0% to 3% (excluding portfolio and currencyeffects).
O-2
In setting our targets for fiscal year 2023 and our mid-term targets we have assumed, among
other things:
 market trends to materialize as described in “ 11 Industry Overview ”, including an impact of
COVID-19 on market developments not exceeding the magnitude as outlined therein, nosecond wave of COVID-19 or a significant prolongation of the current pandemic leading tocomprehensive lockdown measures as experienced in the first half of 2020. Further, we assumea recovery of a part of the negative impact of COVID-19 on our business experienced in thefiscal year 2020 by the fiscal year 2023, with first recoveries in our Gas and Power segment’sTransmission and Generation divisions already in the fiscal year 2021, as well as a recovery ofoil prices to pre-COVID-19 levels in the mid-term to around USD 65-70 bbl and an overallpositive impact from the trend towards decarbonization which is expected to benefit ourrelated offerings, including our New Energy Business;
 that there will be no significant changes in existing political, legal, fiscal, market or economic
conditions, or in applicable legislation, regulations or rules (including, but not limited to,accounting policies, accounting treatments and tax rules and interpretative guidance) and thatforeign exchange rates will not change materially, in each case except as described in thissection and elsewhere in this Prospectus, and that we will not become party to any litigation oradministrative proceeding or proceedings that might have a material impact on us of which weare not currently aware;
 a successful execution of our strategies, including the successful implementation of current and
the introduction of potential further reorganization and cost saving programs, the successfulgrowth of our service revenue share, the successful implementation of operationalimprovement programs aimed at supporting a focus on high-margin projects and a reductionof non-conformance costs (for more information, see “ 12.2 Investment Highlights ”);
 that, compared to the fiscal year 2018, our Gas and Power segment’s restructuring and
optimization programs and potential further measures achieve annual global gross cost savingsof around €700 million by the fiscal year 2021. The originally targeted annual global gross cost
savings for the fiscal year 2023 of around €1 billion are exceeded by at least €300 million,
these programs and measures, deliver additional annual global gross cost savings in the lowtriple digit euro million range by the fiscal year 2025; and the costs incurred in connection withthe implementation of these programs and measures do not to exceed our currentexpectations. For more information, see “ 9.4.10.1 Restructuring and Integration Measures in
our Gas and Power Segment ”;
 regarding our SGRE segment, the successful implementation of its new “LEAP” program. For
more information, see “ 9.4.10.2 Restructuring and Integration Measures in our SGRE Segment ”
and “ 12.4 SGRE Segment ”;
 that our SGRE segment achieves annual cost savings of up to €100 million in particular due to
intensified cooperation between Siemens Energy, Siemens and our SGRE segment (see also“18.1.1.2 Relationships with and Services Provided by the Siemens Group to SGRE ”);
 that we will successfully transition to our stand-alone setup. In the fiscal year 2021, we expect a
high double-digit euro million amount as stand-alone costs. In the fiscal years 2022 and 2023,we expect a mid double-digit million euro amount as stand-alone costs per annum. Thereafter,we do not expect to incur further stand-alone costs.

Conservation of Resources, pp. 43-46 We are reporting significant environmental incidents. During the fiscal year 2021, there were two significant environmental incidents related 
to Siemens Energy (fiscal year 2020: zero). One was due to the malfunction of a gas cylinder valve leading to a loss of SF6 to the atmosphere 
and the second incident was a release of synthetic lubricant to a water stream.
Product Safety Number of recalls issued, total units 
recalledRT-EE-250a.1 not applicable By continually analyzing our products, solutions and services, quantifying their impacts and determining areas of improvement, we are 
building the foundation for deriving and implementing measures contributing to a circular economy. Product stewardship at Siemens Energy 
follows the key standards of the ISO 14000 series, with individual approaches for each Division. The approach is centrally supported by the 
respective Global EHS departments. It is also an integral part of our Zero Harm approach, which aims to prevent adverse effects to health and 
the environment due to our business and operational activities. Product safety and product quality topics are also addressed via defined 
circulars, reporting lines and organizational structures. Customers, developers and manufacturers are provided with user and service manuals 
that describe the safe use of products, functionality and product maintenance requirements.

Product Lifecycle Management Percentage of products by revenue 
that contain IEC 62474 declarable 
substancesRT-EE-410a.1  Sustainability Report 2021:   
Product Stewardship, pp. 47-49 We are currently not reporting products by revenue that contain IEC 62474 declarable substances. However, Siemens Energy uses globally 
standardized materials and substances registers for restricted and declarable substances and products. The lists identify any substances that 
need to be declared for each product and are updated every six months according to current directives from the European Chemicals Agency. 
As part of the Siemens Energy supplier assessment and qualification process, suppliers are required to identify whether any of their products 
or components contain substances that need to be declared according to the specific legislation. Suppliers then need to provide a detailed 
declaration should any such substances be used within their design and manufacturing activities. 
We encourage our suppliers to use the industry substance management platform BOMCheck to share declarations for substances of very high 
concern (SVHC) and link this information to our IT systems. In this way, we can proactively manage risks related to substance restrictions. This 
year, we have started several projects to continue the implementation of the new reporting requirement “SCIP” (Substances of Concern In 
Products), a database established under the EU’s Waste Framework Directive that registers products containing SVHC.

Decarbonization, pp. 28-34 In fiscal year 2020, we were still part of the Siemens AG Environmental Portfolio (EP) reporting, an annual report which indicates how much 
GHG is reduced by the products and solutions which qualify as Environmental Portfolio elements and how much revenue they generate. As an 
independent energy company, we have revisited the existing approach and especially considered an increasing stakeholder focus on carbon 
budgets as well as the upcoming reporting requirements on sustainable revenue, capital expenditure and operating expenses in line with EU 
Taxonomy criteria. In the light of these developments, we decided to end the EP reporting and to implement a reporting on absolute Scope 3 
emissions from the use of sold products (indirect emissions from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organization) instead.

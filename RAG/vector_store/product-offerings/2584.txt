Restricted1PURPOSE & SCOPE
The purpose of this procedure is to detail the process for the use of the Valve Block Wet Mate Plug interface
blanking plug TC6A-528.
The blanking plug TC6A-528 replicates the sealing features of the wet mate plugs DHCE-A43, A47, A62 and
A80. Due to the design similarities between the connectors and the blanking plug, this blanking plug is suitable
for repeated testing up to a maximum test pressure of 15,000 psi as long as the checks in Section 5 are satisfied.

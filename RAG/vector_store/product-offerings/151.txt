Thanks to technological advancements and improvements in energy efficiency, retrofitting older facilities presents a cost-effective means of enhancing output while simultaneously mitigating emissions. With Siemens Energy's Brownfield Engine Exchange concept, old gas turbines can be seamlessly replaced with new ones within a short outage period. BEX at a glance The Brownfield Engine Exchange (BEX) solution is designed based on a plug-and-play concept, providing a streamlined retrofitting process that yields improved performance and efficiency for your gas turbine. By integrating our latest H2-capable gas turbines into your asset, BEX can also help future-proof your operation. BEX operates on three guiding principles: Provide the flexibility to maintain the existing steam cycle or update it based on your future requirements Develop a tailored solution that fits your unique needs, by involving transparent discussions about layouts, business cases, and Balance of Plant calculations Integrating the new gas turbine package while reusing as many existing infrastructure components as possible, i.e. filter house, exhaust channel, foundation, and generator Features and Benefits Fleet Applicability Improved efficiency and power output Significant savings on fuel cost, CO2 tax and maintenance cost Fast start and load capability Extended outage intervals Greater fuel flexibility thanks to the latest DLE technology focusing on renewable fuels (H2 and biofuels) H2 capabilities in Siemens Energy gas turbines PDF (18 MB) Download The BEX concept can be successfully implemented on Siemens Energy gas turbines, but also on a wide variety of other manufacturers' gas turbines, too: GE: Fr3, Fr5, Fr6, LM1600, LM2500, LM5000, LM6000 Baker Hughes: Fr5, Fr6 Hitachi: H25, PGT25 Solar: MARS, TAURUS Sulzer: S7 Mitsubishi: MF1-11 MAN Turbo: THM1203, 1304 Westinghouse: W251 Nuovo Pignone/GE: PGT10 & 16 Rolls-Royce: RB211 Customer story | BASF, Germany Siemens Energy carried out a major outage for BASF in Germany. Thanks to our Brownfield Engine Exchange solution, the power plant could be modernized without interrupting ongoing operations.

Q4 FY2023
Siemens Energy Investor Relations
Dear  shareholders,
On November  15, our CEO,  Christian  Bruch,  and our CFO,  Maria  
Ferraro,  presented  our Q4 and fiscal  year 2023  results,  provided  an 
update  about  the measures  to strengthen  the balance  sheet,  the 
situation  of our wind business  and provided  and updated  medium -
term outlook  for Siemens  Energy  (SE). 
“In a year of unprecedented  challenges  for SE, two-thirds  of our 
businesses  are on a profitable  growth  trajectory . For our 
underperforming  wind  business  all eyes  must  be on cost-out, 
selectivity  and acceleration  of productivity  while  continuously  
working  on the remediation . The current  high  demand  for our 
products  also brings  challenges . We are very glad that we have  
now found  a good  solution  with all parties  to secure  our energy  
transition -accelerated  growth”, said Christian  Bruch .
In Q4 of fiscal  year 2023 , orders  declined  to €10.6bn and were  
down  7.8% on a comparable  basis,  from the high prior-year figure,  
which  was driven  by large  orders  at Grid Technologies  (GT). 
Revenue  of €8.5bn declined  by 2.5% on a comparable  basis  mostly  
due to Siemens  Gamesa  (SG) . Profit  before  special  items  was in the 
expected  range  with negative  €487m mainly  driven  by the loss at 
SG. SE experienced  a Net loss of €870m.
Gas Services  (GS),  GT and Transformation  of Industry  (TI), our 
former  Gas and Power  business,  had a great  performance  during  
fiscal  year 2023 , with strong  orders,  successful  project  execution  
and  operational  improvements  leading  to increased  profitability . 
However,  this achievement  was overshadowed  by the wind  
business,  which  had negative  effects  due to quality  issues,  in 
particular  of the 4.X and 5.X onshore  turbines,  as well as increased  
product  costs  and ramp -up challenges  in the offshore  business .
For fiscal  year 2023 , SE met its guidance  related  to the adjusted  
outlook  in the third quarter . The orders  exceeded  the high level of 
the prior fiscal  year by 33.8% on a comparable  basis  and rose to 
€50.4bn, driven  by GT and SG. The Book -to-bill ratio (ratio  of orders  
to revenue)  was 1.62 for the order  backlog  to rise to a new record  of 
€112bn. Revenue  of €31.1bn was up by 9.9% on a comparable  
basis  driven  by growth  in all segments  except  SG. SE endured  a 
Net loss of around  €4.6bn with a corresponding  EPS of negative€5.47. Free cash  flow (FCF)  pre tax decreased  to €784m driven  by 
an increase  of the negative  FCF pre tax at SG and a decline  of the 
positive  FCF pre tax at GS (from  an exceptionally  high level),  but 
supported  by a strong  cash flow at GT.
As a key facilitator  of the energy  transition,  SE has seen  significant  
growth  in order  intake  and therefore  requires  an increasing  volume  
of guarantees,  an established  industry -wide instrument . The 
German  government  has agreed  in principle  that it will counter -
guarantee  €7.5bn of a total amount  of €12bn of guarantees,  of 
which  €11bn are provided  to SE by a consortium  of banks . In 
addition  to securing  the guarantee  facilities  to safeguard  its own 
growth,  SE is strengthening  its balance  sheet  by selling  18% of its 
stake  in Siemens  Limited,  India  to Siemens  AG for ~€2.1bn. Further  
details  can be found  on page  3. Additionally,  we opened  our 
gigawatt  factory  for electrolyzers  with Air Liquide  in Berlin .
On the following  pages  we provide  you with some  insights  into our 
Capital  Market  Day hosted  in Hamburg  on November  21, in which  
our updated  strategy  was presented,  and analysts  and investors  
had the opportunity  to meet  our management  in person  and to visit 
our wind offshore  facility  in Cuxhaven . Additionally,  you can find our 
outlook  for fiscal  year 2024  as well as our targets  for fiscal  year 
2026 .Thank youvery much foryour interest inSiemens Energy . 
Iwish youahappy holiday season . 
Allthebest.

Enabling the energy transition
Due to the high demand  for SE's energy  transition  technologies,  the current  order  backlog  of the entire  portfolio  
amounts  to €112 billion . With the long project  durations  in the energy  sector,  guarantees  for advanced  payments,  
performance  or warranty  bonds  are a standard  instrument  of the industry .
Key facts  about  guarantees :
•Guarantees  protect  customers  in case  contractual  obligations  are not fulfilled
•Banks,  insurance  companies  and third parties  (e.g KfW, Euler  Hermes,  or EIB) provide  guarantees  against  a 
fee and are usually  between  5% and 25% of the order  value
•Industry -wide demand  for guarantees  is rising  due to increasing  investments  in the energy  transition
Agreement  reached  to secure  €12bn in guarantees :
The German  government  has agreed  in principle  that it will counter  guarantee  €7.5 billion  of a total amount  of 
€12 billion  of guarantees,  of which  €11 billion  are provided  to SE by a consortium  of banks . In return,  the federal  
government  will receive  a standard  market  payment  from SE. The remaining  €1 billion  will be provided  by an 
additional  consortium  led by Deutsche  Bank .
Sale of 18% in Siemens Limited (India) to Siemens AG
Strengthening the balance sheet with ~€2.1bn in near -term proceeds
SE will sell 18% of its stake  in Siemens  Limited,  India  (SIL)  to 
Siemens  AG for ~€2.1bn. SIL is a publicly  listed  company  in 
India . The purchase  price  is based  on a 5-day Volume  Weighted  
Average  Price  (VWAP)  applying  a 15% discount . 
This partial  sale has no impact  on SE’s operations  in India . These  
will continue  to the same  extent  as before  under  a supplementary  
agreement . India  remains  a strategically  important  growth  market  
for SE, in which  the company  continues  to invest .
SE will receive  the cash  as early  as December  2023  (upon  
transaction  closing) . SE and SAG are to commence  the demerger  
process  at SIL, and in approximately  5 years,  SE is expected  to 
take a majority  stake  in SIL Gas & Power  business .€3.4bn €3.4bn€3.3bn€0.8bn€7.0bn€9.4bn€13.7bn €13.7bn

This document  contains  statements  related  to our future  business  
and financial  performance,  and future  events  or developments  
involving  Siemens  Energy  that may constitute  forward -looking  
statements . These  statements  may be identified  by words  such  as 
“expect,”  “look  forward  to,” “anticipate”  “intend,”  “plan,”  “believe,”  
“seek,”  “estimate,”  “will,”  “project,”  or words  of similar  meaning . We 
may also make  forward -looking  statements  in other  reports,  
prospectuses,  in presentations,  in material  delivered  to 
shareholders,  and in press  releases . In addition,  our representatives  
may from time to time make  oral forward -looking  statements . Such  
statements  are based  on the current  expectations  and certain  
assumptions  of Siemens  Energy’s  management,  of which  many  are 
beyond  Siemens  Energy’s  control . These  are subject  to a number  of 
risks,  uncertainties,  and other  factors,  including,  but not limited  to, 
those  described  in disclosures,  in particular  in the chapter  “Report  
on expected  developments  and associated  material  opportunities  
and risks”  in the Annual  Report . Should  one or more  of these  risks 
or uncertainties  materialize,  should  acts of force  majeure,  such  as 
pandemics,  occur,  or should  underlying  expectations  including  
future  events  occur  at a later date or not at all, or shouldassumptions  prove  incorrect,  Siemens  Energy’s  actual  results,  
performance,  or achievements  may (negatively  or positively)  vary 
materially  from those  described  explicitly  or implicitly  in the relevant  
forward -looking  statement . Siemens  Energy  neither  intends,  nor 
assumes  any obligation,  to update  or revise  these  forward -looking  
statements  in light of developments  which  differ  from those  
anticipated . This document  includes  supplemental  financial

or as alternatives  to measures  of Siemens  Energy’s  net assets  and 
financial  position  or results  of operations  as presented  in 
accordance  with the applicable  financial  reporting  framework  in its 
consolidated  financial  statements . Other  companies  that report  or 
describe  similarly  titled  alternative  performance  measures  may 
calculate  them  differently . Due to rounding,  numbers  presented

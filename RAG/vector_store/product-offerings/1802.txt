2Insert Production
The keycompo nent forproduc ingtheinsert siswhatis
known asthetemplate shaft. Wiresareintrodu cedinthe
slots inthetemplat eshaft, and these areinserted ina
smooth tube togeth erwith theshaft (Fig.1).
The wires ofthesubsequ entinsert areguided bythe
winding head shown below tothetemplate shaft and are
clamped totheend face. Ifthetemplate shaft isturned

thewires guided bythewinding head. The smooth heat
exchang etube,intowhich thetemplate shaft move stogeth-
erwith theinsert, isposition edattheendfaceofthewind-
inghead.

exchang etube,therotation oftheshaft isstopped. Thewire
clamp isloosened, andtheshaft isthen turned backslightly.
When theshaft isturned back, thewires autom atical lystayintheir positi oninthetube. Assoon asthetemplate shaft is

Unfortunat ely,themarkethaschanged radically overthe

Implement ation ofthesmooth tubes with inserts de-

used fortheevaporato rheatexcha ngesurfaces duetothe
extreme lyhigh heat fluxes. Theinserts significantly improve
internal heat transfer ,especially inthetwo-p hase zone,and
reduce themate rialtemper ature oftheheat excha ngetube.

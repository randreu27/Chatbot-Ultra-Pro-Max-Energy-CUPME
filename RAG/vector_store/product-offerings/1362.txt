Virtual AGM
January 2024 © Siemens Energy, 20244AGM 2024 in virtual format
Live Interaction with shareholders▪On February 26, 2024, the AGM 2024 shall be held as virtual meeting (without physical presence of the shareholders or their 
representatives) based on the AGM 2023 approval of Articles of Assocation (91.7% approval rate)
▪Virtual format preferred to allow widespread active participation and due to cost and sustainability reasons
Main considerations to improve shareholder experience vs. AGM 2023 :
Shareholder addresses and questions can be asked in German and English 
(simultaneous interpretation provided by the company)  –increased attractiveness 
for international shareholders
▪Active international shareholder participation already at AGM 2023
Complete AGM can be viewed publicly without login requirement –user friendly 
experience
Technical issues at the beginning of AGM 2023 have been analyzed in detail and 
fixed –despite these issues shareholders’ participation in general debate was 
never affected in AGM 2023
▪After the “teething troubles” of ADEUS’ internet service on its first deployment in SE’s 
AGM 2023, all subsequent AGMs in 2023 supported by ADEUS ran smoothly. SE 
established clear processes to ensure internet service stability in AGM 2024

January 2024Diversity Concept
Supervisory Board
DiversitySE’s Supervisory Board diversity concept was approved by the Supervisory Board in September 2022:
▪Personality and integrity
Each member shall have the personality and integrity needed to perform their duties properly. SB members must always 
place the interests of the Company at the center of their actions as a Supervisory Board member
▪Individual professional abilities
The candidates proposed for election to the SB must have the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to carry out 
the functions of a Supervisory Board member in a multinational publicly traded company . Each member of the SB should 
know and understand the main product groups, customer groups, and sales markets of the Company and its strategy
▪Availability
Each member of the SB must have sufficient time to exercise the mandate with the necessary regularity and diligence
▪Limit restricting the number of terms on the SB
Nominations shall take into account that the SB has resolved, as a rule, to limit membership on the SB to three full terms of 
office . 
▪Professional diversity
With regard to the composition of the SB, care must be taken to ensure that its members collectively possess the 
professional skills required to fulfill their duties and that they have knowledge and experience in the business areas that 
are important for Siemens Energy, in particular those of energy generation, transmission, distribution, and storage . As a 
group, the members of the SB must be familiar with the sector in which the Company operates
▪Diversity/ Internationality
With regard to the composition of the SB, attention shall be paid to achieving sufficient diversity
▪Independence
The SB shall include an appropriate number of members representing shareholders who are independent as determined by the 
shareholder representatives on the SB.6

Short -Term Bonus
Pay-for-Performance :
▪ Differentiation between Executive Board Members (EBMs) 
with and without direct responsibility for a Business Area in 
short -term variable compensation for FY23 
▪ Higher target attainment for Karim Amin, Tim Holt and Anne -
Laure de Chammard reflects strong operational performance 
in GS, GT and TI
▪ Setbacks at Siemens Gamesa and poor Group earnings 
result for FY23 reflected in 1) 0% target attainment for Group 
Profit margin in the Bonus FY23, which is 1/3 of the Bonus for 
Dr. Christian Bruch, Maria Ferraro and Vinod Philip and 2) 
lower estimated value of unvested LTI tranches.
January 2024 © Siemens Energy, 202416Executive Compensation in FY23
Siemens Energy Stock Awards
▪ Impact on the value of long -term incentive tranches is even stronger than on short -term variable compensation. New voluntary dis closure in compensation report FY23 
(“notional value of long -term variable compensation”) shows that target attainment for unvested LTI tranches is currently estima ted (as of October 31, 2023) at 72%, 81% 
and 35% for the tranches 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the value of those tranches is even lower if the share price remains depressed (value of the tranches is 
estimated at 45%, 28% and 15% of the target value for tranches 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively). 
▪ Executive Board Members will see a very significant loss of variable compensation as long as profit and the share price remain below expectations. Th is is not yet visible in 
the main compensation tables because the first LTI share transfer is due in November 2024 –this was also the reason why SE deci ded increase transparency with 
voluntary disclosures.

excluding subscription rights under the 2023 Authorized Capital was used. At the same time, due to respective deduction clauses, the ABB exhausted also 
the respective 10% -headrooms for the exclusion of subscription rights under the 2023 Authorization re/ Convertible Bonds and the 2023 Authorization 
re/Treasury Shares .
To reestablish the 10% -headroom in all these Capital Authorizations again , it is proposed that all three authorizations shall be refreshed by AGM 2024.

Secured power supply in rough
environmental conditions
To secure global power supply over the long term, reliable 
equipment is essential. This naturally also applies to 
applications in rough environmental conditions. In 
particular, low temperatures affect the performance of 
high -voltage circuit breakers.
The most common medium used for arc -extinguishing and 
high -voltage insulation is sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). 
One major technical limitation of SF6, however, is the 
condensation temperature, especially when this gas is used
with significant overpressure. At rated lockout pressure and 
temperatures lower than approx. –30 °C liquefaction occurs 
and the remaining SF6gas densitiy would not be sufficient 
to ensure the full switching performance of the circuit 
breaker.
An appropriate solution is the use of a mixture of SF6  and 
tetrafluormethane (CF4). The mixture of these two
gases represents an optimum solution for covering the 
low-temperature applications without affecting switching 
performance. The mixture ensures a liquefaction -free 
insulation and arc -extinguishing medium as the SF6partial 
pressure is sufficiently reduced.Based on the existing circuit breaker design, the pure SF6 
filling will be replaced by a composition of
•43 percent SF6 and 57 percent CF4 for applications 
down to −50 °C, and
•25 percent SF6and 75 percent CF4 for conditions 
down to −60 °C.
Additionally, the rated filling pressure is increased by 
1.5 bar to 7.5 bar.
Consequently, the new low -temperature circuit breaker 
with mixed gases offers mainly the same technical key 
ratings as the standard circuit breaker that is used for low 
temperature conditions down to −30 °C.
The normal rated current , in particular, was certified for the 
same values as the standard breaker with pure SF6filling. 
For a 60 Hz application, the short -circuit current needs an
insignificant line -to-ground of 3 nF (not required for 50 Hz). 
Usually, this capacitance value is available in power grid 
configurations with capacitive voltage dividers. Obviously, 
a circuit breaker installation that provides this value within 
the grid configuration doesn’t need the external capacitors. 
This gives the customer the possibility to use standard 
equipment without any major modifications.
The new mixed gas solution is an alternative option to the 
proven devices with tank heaters for operation in harsh 
weather conditions with temperatures down to –60°C.

In terms of overall global warming potential (GWP), the 
mixed gas solution also offers advantages for a 100 -year 
time horizon, because the GWP of CF4 (7,400) is three 
times lower than that of SF6(22,800). Additionally, the 
new dead tank offers a leakage rate of less than 0.1 percent 
per annum of gas losses for the complete circuit breaker. 
In comparison to other low -temperature applications with 
tank heaters, the mixed gas solution shows a markedly 
reduced CO2footprint.Even within the same voltage range, a reduction of the 
GWP by 56 percent can be achieved by the enhanced 
design from 2015 and the use of mixed gases as shown in 
the diagrams. During the manufacturing phase, optimized 
utilization of materials (e.g., a smaller base frame), as well 
as the use of mixed gases instead of permanent heating 
during operation in low -temperature areas, all aspects 
contribute to the improved GWP.Global Warming Potential

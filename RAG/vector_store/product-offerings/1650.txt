May 2022Revamp for Increase in Rotor 
Availability 
(Applicable for all SST Fleet)
Benefits1
•< 2 years in ROI  
•CO2 savings from increased turbine efficiency -reduced steam 
consumption to produce the same power 
•Cost and productivity benefits from increased lifetime expectancy of the 
turbine
Scope of work & Implementation
•For OOEM customers, the refurbishment starts with a 3D scan of the 
turbine design followed by laser measurements for parts 
•The revamp is recommended to be done during a major overhaul. Features
•Increased turbine availability and operational safety by the installment of 
new rotor and stator parts 
•Existing structural components is reused as much as possible Product Overview 
Suited for Siemens and OOEM customers having older turbines with poor 
performance and for customers looking to increase their equipment 
safety and availability 
1 Benefits depend on the unit type, MW, and application and will differ from customer to customer.

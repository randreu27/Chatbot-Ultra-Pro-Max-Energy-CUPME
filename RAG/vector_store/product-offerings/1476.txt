 
1 Earnings Release  Q2 FY 2022  
January  1 to March  31, 2022 
Munich, Germany, May 11, 2022  – Siemens Energy today announced its results for the second  quarter of 
fiscal year 2022 that ended March  31, 202 2. 
Gas and Power with solid performance, disappointing 
results at SGRE weigh down  Siemens Energy Group  
“Gas and Power delivered a solid performan ce this quarter . The segment delivered  a solid operating result 
and a strong order intake despite first impacts of the sanctions against Russia and increasing supply chains 
constraints. Disappointing again is the performance of SGRE which is weighing heavi ly on Siemens Energy. 
The situation at SGRE has aggravated  further since the last profit warning . As majority shareholder, we pro-
vide our expertise to get to the bottom of the problems and to tackle the issues ”, says Christian Bruch, Pres-
ident and CEO of Siemens Energy AG.  
• Continuing constraints in global s upply chains carried on affecting the business of  Siemens Energy, pre-
dominantly a t Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) , where difficult supply markets amplified the 
impacts rooting in continued operational problems. As a result, SGRE report ed an Adjusted EBITA of neg-
ative €301m for the second quarter . 
• The consequences of the war in Ukraine  led to initial minor negative effects on the second quarter results 
of Siemens Energy . 
• Solid o rders of €7.9bn included  a strong contribution from  Gas and Power ( GP), resulting in the order 
backlog climbing to a record  of €89.3bn. Compared to the ex ceptional high prior -year figure , orders  came 
in 27.5% lower for the quarter on a comparable basis  (excluding currency translation and portfolio ef-
fects ). 
• Revenue  of €6.6m was slightly down by 1.7% on a comparable basis , as moderate growth at  GP was more 
than offset by a declin e at SGRE.  
• Adjusted EBITA for Siemens Energy was negative € 77m (Q 2 FY 2021: positive € 197m) due to  the loss at 
SGRE . In contrast, GP substantially increased its Adjusted EBITA year -over-year. Adjusted EBITA before spe-
cial it ems of Siemens Energy was negative € 21m compared to positive  €288m in prior -year quarter.  
• Siemens Energy’s n et loss amounted to € 252m (Q2 FY 2021:  net income  of €31m). Corresponding basic 
earnings per share (EPS) were negative € 0.22 (Q2 FY 2021: positive  €0.03). 
• Free cash flow pre tax sharply decreased to negative  €351m (Q2 FY 2021: positive  €433m) driven by the 
earnings decline at SGRE while GP deliver ed a positive contribution . 
• Given SGRE’s adjusted aspiration for fiscal year 2022  and in light of prevailing challenges , management 
now expects for Siemens Energy for fiscal year 2022 results towards the low end of the guidance ranges 
for comparable revenue development (negative 2% to positive 3%) and Adjusted EBITA margin before 
special items  (positive 2% to positive 4%) . 
• Management notes an increasingly challenging environment and growing uncertainty with regards to 
the continuation and economic burdens of the war in Ukraine as well as the COVID -19 situation in China 
and cannot rule out further negative effects associated to a n escalation of these factors .

1 Comparable basis: Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects  • Solid o rders including a strong contribution from GP wer e below the 
exceptionally high prior -year basis of comparison , which comprised 
several large orders at SGRE . 
• Book -to-bill ratio was 1 .20. Order backlog rose to a new high  of 
€89.3bn (December  31, 2021: €8 7.1bn). 
• Slight  decline in r evenue due to operational challenges a t SGRE and 
partly caused by supply chain constraints . 
• Service revenue came in clearly  above  prior-year quarter ’s level . 
• On a nominal basis , orders declined  24.8% and revenue rose 1.5%. 
• Adjusted EBITA  and Adjusted EBITA before special items sharply de-
clined  year-over-year. As in the past quarter, the negative result  of 
SGRE outweighed a strong contribution from  GP. 
• Impacts from s pecial items were substantially  down year -over-year, 
due to lower special items at SGRE . 
• Free cash flow pre tax came in negative, mostly driven by the nega-
tive result at SGRE, while GP delivered  another positive contribution 
after a markedly strong past quarter . 
• During the quarter, provisions for pensions and similar obligations 
decreased  from  €836m as of December  31, 2021 to € 725m as of 
March  31, 202 2 driven by higher discount rates .

1 Comparable basis: Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects  • Order g rowth at GP resulted from increases across all businesses  and 
was supported by b oth the new unit as well as the service business . 
Demand in the Americas reporting region  was e specially strong . 
• GP again reported a high Book -to-bill ratio of 1.52. This  result ed in 
an order backlog of €56.6bn exceeding previous  quarter -end record . 
• Revenue grew moderately , driven by Transmission and Industrial Ap-
plications.  The improvement mainly came from  the service business . 
• On a nominal basis, orders and revenue increased by 34.0%  and 
6.1%, respectively . 
• Adjusted EBITA of GP increased due to  a strong  quarterly operational 
performance. Improve ment  year-over-year was primari ly due to the 
increased volume in the service business.  The reporting quarter  in-
cluded minor negative i mpacts related to the war in Ukraine . 
• Impacts from special items increased year-over-year despite declin-
ing restructuring costs as the reporting quarter comprised an impair-
ment associated with the planned sale of a business  and prior  year 
include d a reversal of a write -down related to aeroderivative gas tur-
bines . 
• After a markedly strong past quarter, f ree cash flow pre tax was be-
low p rior-year’s level, mainly  due to  a negative swing year -over-year 
associated with derivatives .

 • Orders in the SGRE segment were sharply below the exceptional ly 
high prior -year period’s level, which included  three offshore wind 
farm  order s in the Europe, C.I.S., Middle East and Africa reporting 
region worth  approximately €2.8bn . In contrast , order intake of the 
recent quarter was affected also by, amongst other reasons, delayed 
customer investment decisions.  
• Book -to-bill ratio of SGRE came in at 0.55 leading to an order backlog 
of €3 2.8bn at quarter -end, below  prior quarter -end’s level.  
• Revenue was significantly  down compared to  prior -year quarter’s 
level  due to  operational problems, mostly related to the ramp -up of 
the onshore 5 .X platform and supply chain constraints  in the wind 
turbines business . The service business posted an increase . 
• On a nominal basis, segment’s orders declined  by 78.2%, and reve-
nue decreas ed by 6.8%. 
• Adjusted EBITA decreased  compared to prior -year quarter mainly 
driven by continued operational problems, further pressure on en-
ergy, commodities,  and transportation costs  coupled with  lower vol-
ume . Included was a burden  from  the revaluation of projects  in the 
wind turbines business resulting from new assumptions for market 
and production conditions.  
• Negative Free cash flow pre tax sharply increased  year-over -year 
mainly driven by the lower result and an increase of receivables .

the current year presentation.  
 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements includes items 
which management does not consider to be indicative of the segments ’ 
performance – mainly  centrally carried pension expenses , Treasury ac-

5 Outlook  
For the GP segment  in fiscal year 2022,  we maintain  our guidance for  comparable revenue growth (exclud-
ing currency translation and portfolio effects)  between  positive 1% and positive 5%, and Adjusted EBITA 
margin before special items between positive 4.5% and positive 6.5%.  However, in light of prevailing chal-
lenges, we expect results towards the low end of the guidance ranges. For fiscal year 2023, we confirm our 
target of an Adjusted EBITA margin before special items in a range between positive 6% and positive 8%. 
Given SGRE’s performance of the first half year and continued internal and external uncertainties, SGRE 
announced that its previous guidance of a comparable decline of revenue between negative 2% and nega-
tive 9% and an Adjusted EBITA margin before special items in a range of negative 4% to positive 1% is no 
longer valid. According to SGRE, the company cannot provide projections for the second half of the year with 
the desirable detail and precision  but will continue to work to achieve a comparable revenue developmen t 
within the range of negative 2% and negative 9%, and Adjusted EBITA margin before special items towards  
the low end of the previous guidance range of negative 4%.  
For Siemens Energy  we now expect results towards the low end of the guidance ranges for comparable 
revenue development (negative 2% to positive 3% ) and Adjusted EBITA margin before special items (positive 
2% to positive 4%).  Consequently, we expect Net loss to be level with prior year compared to the previous 
guidance of a sharp i mprovement . We confirm expectations for the Free cash flow pre tax to be in a range 
of a positive mid -triple -digit million €.  
Because of the war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed  on Russia the operating environment for Siemens 
Energy has become more challenging. Siemens Energy is complying with all sanctions and has stopped any 
new business in Russia. Siemens Energy has started to see an impact on revenue and profitability as a re sult 
of the war and is experiencing an aggravation of the existing supply chain challenges . We are  currently not 
able to fully assess the potential impact for the remainder of the fiscal year and can therefore not rule out 
further negative effects mainly on revenue , profitability  and recoverability of assets . In addition, we note a 
rising impact related to the COVID -19 situation in China.  
This guidance assumes no further major financial impacts from COVID -19 on our business activity and ex-
cludes charges rel ated to legal and regulatory matters  including further negative effects from the war in 
Ukraine and its economic consequences .

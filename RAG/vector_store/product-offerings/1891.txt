Condition monitoring is a proven strategy  to identify up-
coming problems at the earliest possible time. Mainte-
nance measures can be planned in time, unplanned shut-
downs can be avoided, repair times can be shortened.  
The availability of assets increases . 
 
VIBROEXPERT CM500  is the Siemens  Energy  condition 
monitoring software package for all kind of machinery fo-
cusing on  
• Automated early detection of abnormal  machinery 
behavior by comparison of actual measurements 
with the learned normal behavior for groups of 
machines in cycle times of less  than a sec ond 
• Root cause analysis by provision of a complete set 
of vibration analysis tools for the vibration diag-
nostician  
• Information at a glance for the operator in various 
standard and customized diagrams,  tables and no-
tifications  
 
As a vibration measurement -based condition monitoring 
system VIBROEXPERT CM500 is able to reliably detect fail-
ures such as (examples only):  
• Unbalance  (e.g.,  caused by lost parts, bended 
shafts, …)  
• Misalignment  
• Rubbing  
• Bearing faults  
• Rolling element bearing faults  
• Gearbox faults  
• Many others  
 
Notable features  
 
For turbo machinery  
• Synchronous data acquisition from all sensors  con-
nected to the data acquisition unit showing corre-
lations between events  
• Intelligent data reduction allows to store long last-
ing machine histories over many years without 
loss of data  
• Intelligent data reduction enables the user to han-
dle huge amount of information  
• Statistical evaluation of the machine behavior sup-
ports automated setting of tolerance zones for up 
to 64 operating conditions at constant speed ope r-
ation  
• Differentiation of alerts for fast and slow changes 
in the machinery behavior allows to distinguish 
mechanical and thermal problems  
•  
•  
• Logical linking of event patterns with assigned ac-
tions for automated reaction on anomalies  
• Tolerance zone monitoring during start up and 
coast down  
 
  
 
For machines with gearboxes and /or rolling element bear-
ings  
• Monitoring of up to 25 frequency bands

Unrestricted   © 202 1 Siemens En ergy  Page  4 Archiving concept  
The system acquires data simultaneously per machine from 
all measuring chains connected including parameters re-
ceived via digital interfaces. All data received at the same 
time are stored as one data set called “condition v ector”.  
Storing complete data sets is essential for root cause analy-
sis. 
• first occur and failure development  
• correlation of measurements  
 
Vibroexpert CM500 allows to store data  
• Manually (key push)  
• At fixed times and in fixes time intervals  
• In case of an event with “Turbomachinery Monitor-
ing Basic” or “Turbomachinery Monitoring Expert” 
only  
• In speed increments (with “speed variable operat-
ing mode” only)  
• Time wave forms, spectra, orbits can be stored at 
fixed times and manually (module diagnostic func-
tions) 
• A “short term memory” holding characteristic val-
ues of the last <= 3 hours is available. The content 
of the “short term memory” can be automatically 
stored in case of an event  
User rights  
Five user types are available  
• Everyone (not registered user)  
• Guest 
• User  
• Main User  
• Administrator  
 
IT structure  
 
The condition monitoring software is available as  
• A standalone solution with a single computer 
(PC/Server) connected to up to 16 data acquisition 
units monitoring multiple machines  
• A client server solution wh ere many clients have 
access to a server hosting Vibroexpert CM500  
• Up to 16 VIB3000 data acquisition units can be 
connected to a server hosting Vibroexpert CM500  
• Up to 32 machines can be monitored with one  
installation  
 
Interfaces  
 
Vibroexpert CM500 inclu des OPC Client and Server func-
tionality. A Modbus interface is also available. The related 
modules need to be acquired.  These interfaces can be 
used to receive / transmit process data such as load or ex-
citer current from / to the DCS and / or from histori ans.  The OPC and Modbus interfaces can also be used to trans-
mit and receive actual vibration characteristic values to the 
DCS and / or historians.  
Phase angle calculation  
Phase angle calculation can be defined as  
• Mathematical angles (Y = a sin (wt+ ρ) 
• next positive maximum of amplitude after 
keyphasor ® signal  
 
 
Data acquisition units  
The software Vibroexpert  CM500 requires VIB330 modules 
as part of VIB3000 data acquisition systems for machinery 
protection and condition monitoring.

This module is specifically tailored to large  machine trains 
with sleeve bearings such as turbine - generator sets or tur-
bine compressor sets. It allows to determine the normal be-
havior based on statistic evaluations and detect abnormal 
behavior.  
 
Functionality  
 
Vector - Monitoring at constant speed op. mode  
• Statistical determination of the normal behavio ur of a 
machine train in rated operation (e.g.  constant speed) 
depending  on the operating state (e.g. power).   
• The operating mode “rated operation" is further diffe-
rentiated by up to 3 measurements such as  power or 
excitation current (control parameters).   
• The value range of each control parameter is divided 
into up to 4 arb itrary classes.  
• For each class, the normal behavior of the  machine is 
determined.  
• Following diagnostic limit and reference values  are cal-
culated for vibration signals and radial  shaft position  
• Tolerance zones  
• Normal signal changes in the second range  
• Normal signal changes in the minute range  
• Editing and saving the automatically determined limit 
and reference values  is possible.  
• Identification and presentation of deviations  from the 
normal behavior using functionality of  the basic mo-
dule.  
• Any deviati on from “normal” is called an event.  Events 
can be linked to “event patterns” using  logical ope-
rands.  
• If an “event pattern” occurs, a set of predefined actions 
can be automatically performed, e.g.  
• Switching relays  
• Perform additional measurements  
• Start  the transient recorder   
• Display notifications  
• Copy short term memory  
• Send email  
• …  
• Manual setting tolerance zones at a defined speed 
range to monitor the machine train during halt in the

The module supports the detection of resonance frequen-
cies. Changing resonance frequencies are a hint to changed 
stiffness and damping which  might be caused  by loose 
parts or cracks.   
Machines should not be operated close to resonance fre-
quencies.

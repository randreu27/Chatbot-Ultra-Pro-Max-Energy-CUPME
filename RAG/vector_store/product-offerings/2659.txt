Foreword
The availability of electric energy is vital for  
economic development and for quality of life and 
the demand is constantly increasing. One of the 
necessary conditions for a reliable electric power 
supply is a well-functioning transmission system.   
Siemens Energy worldwide supports customers 
along the entire chain of energy conversion, 
with an efficient range of products, solutions 
and know-how for the transmission of  
electrical energy from one source. 
 
Circuit breakers are the central part of air-  
insulated (AIS) and gas-insulated (GIS) switchgear. 
High-voltage circuit breakers are mechanical 
switching devices which connect and break  
current circuits (operating currents and fault 
currents) and carry the nominal current in  
closed position.
As a world market leader, Siemens Energy takes 
the responsibility to provide circuit breakers which 
meet highest environmental, technological and 
economic conditions in the various countries worldwide. For more than 150 years we have been 
shaping and improving the energy world. 
Sustainability is the core of our actions
Siemens Energy is fully committed to supporting 
worldwide agreements and sustainable develop -
ment goals of nations and our customers. Our 
ambition is to achieve climate-neutrality in our 
own operations by 2030 and to cover 100% of our 
own electricity consumption from renewable 
sources by 2023.  
Furthermore, we want to make power grids com -
pletely free of greenhouse gas emissions with 
highest performance and health and safety stan -
dards. Sustainable means for us: Zero SF6 gas, 
Zero F-mix-gases and Zero greenhouse gases.  
Our Blue products with vacuum interruption and 
clean air insulation combine the game changing 
technology paving the way for climate neutral 
high-voltage switchgear.Chapter overview GIS | iPDF 8DQ1 8DN9 8DN8 8VN1 8VM1

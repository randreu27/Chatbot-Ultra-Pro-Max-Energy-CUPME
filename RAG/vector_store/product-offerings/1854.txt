Jurong, Singapore, March 0 5, 2021  
Press release  by Siemens Energy and PacificLight Power Pte Ltd  
Accelerating Singapore’s Carbon -Lite Future 
with The Region’s First Advanced Turbine 
Efficiency Package (ATEP)  
• Significant fuel savings and reduction of CO2 emissions to improve Singapore’s carbon footprint  
• The first ATEP to be implemented in Asia by customer PacificLight Power Pte Ltd  
• Increases efficiency for base and part load operation of gas turbines at the exi sting power plant 
with cutting -edge technology and aerodynamic design  
 
The first -ever Advanced Turbine Efficiency Package (ATEP) will soon be implemented in Asia for 
customer PacificLight Power Pte Ltd at its existing 800MW power plant in Jurong Island, Si ngapore, 
following a recent agreement signed with Siemens Energy. Under this ATEP, new hot gas path parts 
have been designed using the most advanced, cutting -edge turbine technology. The advanced 
profiling and aero features, ultra -efficient internal coolin g and sealing, optimized stage loading, 
advanced materials and manufacturing methods will deliver \higher operational efficiency, hence 
significantly reducing carbon emissions.  
 
This design is derived from Siemens Energy’s continuous development of gas turbine enhancements 
and is modelled on the well -proven SGT5 -4000F gas turbine with a total fleet size of more than 300 
units worldwide and based on advanced computational methods u sed in the Siemens Energy HL -class 
turbine. Once implemented at PacificLight Power’s 2 X 400MW plant in Singapore, the gas turbines 
are set to reinforce the power plant’s presence as one of the most efficient gas -fired power plants in Joint p ress release

Asia. The improved ef ficiency and reduction in carbon emission from ATEP equates to 18,100 tonnes 
of CO 2 equivalent per year.  
 
Additionally, this ATEP agreement comes at the heel of the long -term service agreement’s extended 
scope that prolongs the operational span of the pow er plant with upgrades to generate increased 
revenue for the customer. It will also be another step towards the decarbonization of the future  in 
support of Singapore’s goal for a more sustainable and reliable energy system. At the same time, 
PacificLight P ower has received a Genco Energy Efficiency Grant from the Energy Market Authority of 
Singapore to co -fund this power generation energy efficiency project as part of Singapore’s transition 
towards a low -carbon future.  
 
“PacificLight is committed to continu al improvement to raise its plant efficiency and reduce its carbon 
footprint through innovation. The adoption of ATEP  is the first of its kind in this region  and will 
reinforce PacificLight’s position as one of the most efficient gas -fired power plants in Asia. The ATEP, 
together with the comprehensive suite of energy efficiency improvements that we have implemented 
since commencing operations, will reduce our annual carbon emissions by  over 40,000 tonnes per 
annum, equivalent to supplying carbon -free elect ricity to over 20,000 Singapore households ,” said 
PacificLight Power Pte Ltd CEO Yu Tat Ming.  
 
Siemens Energy Asia Pacific Hub Managing Director  Brian Byrne congratulates the excellent 
collaboration between the cross -divisional teams in creating a win -win situation for the customer. 
“We are delighted to be partnering PacificLight Power for this project to fulfil their plan in envisioning 
this plan t to be the most efficient, and most dispatched (power plant) in Singapore. In extending the 
plant’s long -term service agreement by one cycle as well as modernizing and upgrading the scope of 
supply and works, we are committed to support  our customer in th is journey of contributing towards 
Singapore’s overall carbon abatement and making decarbonization a reality .”  
 
Featuring four stages of ATEP’s turbine blades and vanes, the upgrade of PacificLight’s two units is 
expected to be completed in 2023 and 2024.

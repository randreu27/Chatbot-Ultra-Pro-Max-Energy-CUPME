higher order volumes with growing demand forourproducts
andservices asthey arekeytotheenergy transition .Andyet
there arealso again drawbacks inthethird quarter .SGRE
continued toexperience high losses due tochallenging
market conditions and mistakes made inthepast and
therefore Siemens Energy (SE) hadtoreport aloss inthe

announced anew setup forSiemens Energy and that we
launched acash tender offer fortheoutstanding minority
shares inSGRE with theintention tofully integrate its
operations”, said Christian Bruch .
Orders of€9.8billion continued tobestrong withgrowth of
60.0%year-over-year (on acomparable1basis) .Both
segments contributed totheincrease ,driving theorder
backlog toanother record of€93.4billion .Revenue of
€7.3billion was down by4.7%(onacomparable1basis) as
growth atGPwas more than offset byadecline atSGRE .

to€533million andbasic earnings pershare were negative
€0.54.Free cash flow pretaxdecreased tonegative €25
million driven bySGRE while GPexceeded theprior-year

Securities Market Commission which reduced SE’s net
cash position attheendofthisquarter .
Although further negative effects associated withgeopolitical
and macroeconomic challenges cannot beruled out,
management stillexpects toachieve itsoutlook given for
GPandSEexcluding effects from lostrevenue inconnection
withbusiness inRussia forcomparable1revenue growth .Net
loss ofSEinfiscal year 2022 isexpected toexceed prior

3 Calculated in accordance with Spanish market practice and Spanish Takeover RegulationsSGRE shareholders willbeoffered €18.05pershare incash.This
reflects apremium of27.7%over SGRE’s lastunaffected closing
price on17May 2022 .The offer price also exceeds the6-month
Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) oftheSGRE share prior to
the date ofthe announcement3.Toensure that the price is
equitable /fair theaudit firm PwC was engaged asanindependent
valuator toissue avaluation report .
Following asuccessful closing ofthetransaction, Siemens Energy
AGintends topursue adelisting ofSiemens Gamesa Renewable
Energy S.A.from theSpanish stock exchanges, where itcurrently
trades asamember oftheIBEX 35index .
Assuming a100%offer acceptance (i.e.byallSGRE minority
shareholders), thetransaction value amounts toapproximately €4.0
billion (atanoffer price of€18.05).Siemens Energy isandremains
committed toasolid investment grade credit rating .Therefore, the
financing package isdesigned tosupport thiskeyobjective .
Assuming afullacceptance oftheoffer, Siemens Energy intends to
finance upto€2.5billion ofthetransaction value withequity orequity
likeinstruments .The remainder ofthetransaction willbefinanced
with debt aswell ascash onhand .Asafirst step, equity may be
offered without subscription rights, subject tomarket conditions .
OnMay 21,2022 ,Siemens Energy AGannounced avoluntary cash tender offer toacquire alloutstanding shares
inSiemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A.(SGRE) with theintention todelist andintegrate itsoperations into
Siemens Energy .Wind OEMs areexperiencing challenging market conditions duetomaterial prices andthelack
ofmaterial availability andhigh logistics costs .Because ofmistakes made inthepast these challenging market
conditions have ledtotwoprofit warnings thisyear andwebelieve thatafullintegration ofSGRE intoSiemens
Energy willsupport therestructuring efforts brought onthewaybythenew SGRE management .
Through anintegration, SGRE willsignificantly benefit from Siemens Energy’s expertise andresources andwillbe
able toachieve thetargeted turnaround much quicker .This means higher revenues, higher profitability, higher
cash flowandmuch improved predictability .
Furthermore, upto€300million cost synergies areexpected toresult from supply chain andlogistics synergies,
project execution synergies, butalso joint R&D efforts and obviously, cost reduction through anoptimized
administrative setup .There willbealso growth synergies interms ofgo-to-market andcombined offerings with
regard towind, transmission andhydrogen .

Q3 FY2022 Siemens Energy Shareholder Letter 4Largest offshore grid connection order in the history of SE
Implications of
sanctions•Substantial impact on all existing business activities in Russia after July 10 (end of 5th 
EU sanctions package wind down period) 
•Current sanctions do not justify to continue in the current business setup in 
Russia
Business set-upin
Russia•Concrete steps have been taken to reach optimal solution for SE by the end of the 
fiscal year
•Continuation of existing activities in accordance with the sanctions 
Financial Implications FY22 :
FY23 : The war inUkraine isalready initssixmonths .As
already communicated, with thebeginning ofthewar,
Siemens Energy has immediately stopped allnew
business inRussia andasofJuly 10,Siemens Energy
stopped almost allitsbusiness activities .
Following thereview oftheGPbusiness inlight ofthe
sanctions, Siemens Energy now decided on
restructuring measures forthebusiness inRussia .Therefore, concrete steps haven been taken toreach
anoptimal solution forSEinRussia bytheendofthe
fiscal year.
The restructuring willhave afinancial impact in
fiscal year 2022 asyou can see below .Looking
forward intofiscal year 2023 ,Siemens Energy does
currently notexpect anymajor negative impacts .Restructuring of Business Activities in RussiaTwo newpower links setthecourse formore wind energy in
the German power grid:DolWin 4and BorWin 4will
transport upto1.8gigawatts ofgreen wind power from
several wind farms intheGerman North Sea toland with
lowlosses .
Asaresult, they willbeable tomeet thedemand ofa
major city like Hamburg with 1.8million inhabitants .
Amprion Offshore GmbH hasnow commissioned Siemens
Energy tosupply thenecessary technology fortheconverter
stations oftheir first grid connection projects .The order
value isinthehigh triple digit million Euro range, making it
thelargest offshore gridconnection order Siemens Energy
hasreceived todate.
SE’s scope ofsupply consists oftwoconverter platforms
atsea and two associated stations onland.The
platforms convert alternating current, asproduced bywind
turbines, into direct current .The direct current isthen
transferred toahigh-voltage direct current transmission
cable (HVDC cable) fortransport .Asecond converter
station onland then converts the electricity back into
alternating current .
This istheonly way, thatthelarge amounts ofenergy can
cover thedistance ofaround 215km(DolWin 4)and280km
without significant losses .
The twoconnections willbeinstalled inparallel andarescheduled tobegin operating in2028 .BorWin 4would
thus even beconnected tothegridoneyear earlier than originally planned .
Revenue: ~€400 million impact 
Adj. EBITA before SI: low triple digit € million impact 
(lost Russia business not recorded as SI)
Special Items: ~€200 million impact
Based on our current assumptions, no major negative effects to be expected
Outlook for the fiscal year 2022
For theGPsegment infiscal year 2022 ,westill
expect comparable1revenue growth and Adjusted
EBITA margin before special items towards thelow
endoftheguidance ranges ofpositive 1%topositive
5%and positive 4.5%topositive 6.5%,respectively .
However, forthecomparable revenue growth, effects
related tothecurrent market conditions inRussia are
excluded .Forfiscal year 2023 ,wetarget anAdjusted
EBITA margin before special items unchanged ina
range between positive 6%andpositive 8%.
According toSGRE ,thecompany now isworking to
achieve acomparable revenue growth near thelow
end oftheprevious target range ofnegative 9%to
negative 2%,andanEBIT margin prePPA (purchase
price allocation) andintegration andrestructuring costs
ofcirca negative 5.5%.
Consequently, forSiemens Energy weexpect results
stilltowards thelowendoftheguidance ranges forcomparable revenue development (negative 2%to
positive 3%butexcluding Russia -related effects) and
Adjusted EBITA margin before special items (positive
2%topositive 4%).
Wenow expect Netloss ofSiemens Energy infiscal
year 2022 toexceed prior year’s Net loss
approximately bytheimpact from therestructuring of
business inRussia reported asspecial item.Westill
assume Free cash flow pretaxtobeinarange ofa
positive mid-triple -digitmillion €.
This guidance assumes nofurther major financial
impacts from COVID -19onourbusiness activity and
excludes charges related tolegal and regulatory
matters including further negative effects from thewar
inUkraine anditseconomic consequences .

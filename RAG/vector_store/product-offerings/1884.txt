 
A huge challenge  
One of the biggest challenges facin g 
power producers today is ensuring a 
stable, reliable and affordable supply 
of electric power while  minimizing 
emissions at the same time. Although 
the expansion of renewable energies is 
progress ing rapidly in Europe, coal -
fired power plants still form  the bac k-
bone of an economic and uninterrup t-
ed power supply.  
Groundbreaking efficiency  
The security of supply for the more 
than 17 million inhabitants of the 
Netherlands also depend s on coal -fired 
power plants. The new Eemshaven 
ultra -supercritical steam power plant 
makes a significant co ntribution to 
stable power supply in the Nethe r-
lands. Based on state -of-the-art power 
plant technology from Si emens, it is 
one of  the most ecofriendly coal -fired 
power plants in the world. Thanks to 
its ultra -supercritical steam param e-
ters, the plant achieves  a maximum 
efficiency of over 46 percent. Thanks 
to a high ly efficien t power plant  pro-
cess the Eemshaven power plant co n-
sumes less hard coal compared to 
conventional coal -fired power plants. 
This leads to a reduction of  CO 2 emis-
sions of 2.5 million metric tons per 
year.  Two powerful power plant units  
The Eemshaven power plant consists 
of two units. Each of the se units  has 
an installed electrical capacity of 800 
megawatts. That means that the entire 
plant can produce enough electricity 
for more than 2.5 million h ousehol ds. 
The heart of each unit is a SST5 -6000 
steam turbine, containing  three low -
pressure tu rbines  that  drive a water -
cooled SGen5 -3000W generator . Sie-
mens also supplied  an SST-500 steam 
turbine that is used as a boiler 
feed water pump , the SPPA -T3000 
control system,  as well as an SCon -
7000 condenser and the au xiliaries for 
each unit. All components come from 
Siemens’ German factories in Mülheim 
and Görlitz.  
 
An exemplary footprint  
In addition to its high efficiency, the 
Eemshaven power plant can also be 
co-fired with biomass. This further 
improves the ecological footprint of the plant , as it allows additional redu c-
tions of CO 2 emissions. An d the plant 
also provide s socio-economic benefits. 
The overall project created more than 
130 new jobs in Eemshaven and the 
surrounding area.

Located close to the Eemshaven port, 
the plant can continuously be supplied 
with cooling water from the Ems. Its 
favorable location also enable s coal to 
be deliver ed by river barge .

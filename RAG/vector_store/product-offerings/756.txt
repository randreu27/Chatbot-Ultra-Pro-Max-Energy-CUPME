Omnivise Reliability
Omnivise Reliability helps you switch your maintenance approach from fire-fighting topredictive 
maintenance.
Increased Availability Uses reliability centered maintenance principles todeliver increased reliability 
and availability. Lower Operating Costs Delivers significant cost reduction when compared with 
traditionally designed and managed maintenance programs. Higher Effectiveness Gives access to
theentire Siemens Energy Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) derived Asset Template Library for 
easy reference and better decision -making. Increased Transparency Enables real-time communi -
cation with other specialties, while giving easy access tohistorical information, failure records andreal 
time data.

Omnivise Reliability
Omnivise Reliability supports theReliability Engineer tointroduce and maintain aReliability Centered Maintenance approach. Providing 
anintgrated, intuitively -designed workflow, with allfunctionalities needed todeliver acost-efficient solution, asbudgets tighten and 
operating hours arecut.
The solution also offers access toavast body ofknowledge developed bySiemens Energy Subject Matter Experts through anAsset 
Template Library (ATL) that includes Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), typical indications and recommended tasks forallmajor 
equipment, including auxiliaries ofgasand steam turbine, generators and Balance ofPlant.
This comprehensive library ofasset templates enables engineers todevelop acondition -based maintenance program across theplant 
and enterprise inanefficient way.User -friendly solution, enabling 
condition -based maintenance programs
Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) /
Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)
Guided RCM workflow, with analysis setup, operating context 
definitions, functions and functional failures, FMEA handling, 
implementation requests, updating RCM analysis (regular /events -
based) and reporting.
Criticality Analysis
Enables definition ofgroups, scoring criteria and criticality rules,
with predefined recommendations and asset scoring import /export.
Risk Management
Identifies, evalutaes and manages atolerable risklevel forthe 
organisation, based onfailure mode level.
Investment Planning
Adds Cost Indicators totheanalysis and provides recommendations, 
based oncurrent health and CapEx -OpEx relationship.
Statistical Analysis &Health Index
Access tostatistical indicators and benchmarks, with information 
transparency forcontinuous improvement.
Case Management &Analysis Toolbox
Greater clarity over keyenquiries and items, backed bycase reso-
lution toolkit and richinformation from other applications. Root

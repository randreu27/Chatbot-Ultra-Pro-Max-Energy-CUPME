Globally standardiz ed design
Siemens Energy SPS 2S 245 kV dead tank circuit breakers 
utilize the time-te sted FA spring- spring operating 
mechanism and 3AP  arc assist interr upter common to t he 
entire SPS2 portf olio.
Siemens Energy h as delivered over 160,000 breakers 
worldwide, with o ver 46,000 SPS2 circuit breakers to the US 
market alone sinc e release in 1997 .Standard features
•No TRV capacitor s necessary for b reake rs rated up to 63
kA
•2 or 3 cycle int errupting time opt ions
•Ships fully assem bled and factory tested

2.3 All sublicenses granted by the Customer must
contain appropriate protection for the intellectual
property rights of the Supplier in the Software,

used by the Customer to protect its own
intellectual property rights.
2.4 The Supplier shall, in good time but at the latest by
the time of order confirmation, inform the Customer
in writing whether the deliveries and services
contain Open Source Components. In the contextof this provision, "Open Source Components"
means any software, hardware or other information
that is provided royalty-free by the respective
licensor to any user on the basis of a license with
the right to modify and/or to distribute (e.g. the
GNU General Public License (GPL), the GNU
Lesser GPL (LGPL), or the MIT License). Should
the deliveries and services by the Supplier contain
Open Source Components, the Supplier shall
comply with all applicable open source license
terms and shall grant all those rights to the
Customer and provide all information which
Customer needs in order to comply himself with
the applicable license terms. In particular, the
Supplier must deliver to the Customer promptly
after the order is confirmed the following:
-  A schedule of all Open Source Components
used, indicating the relevant license, its version
and including a copy of the complete text of
such license and including a reference to
copyright and/or authorship. Such schedule must
have an understandable structure and contain a
table of contents.
-  The complete source code of the relevant open
source software, including scripts and
information regarding its generating environment
in so far as the applicable open source
conditions require this.
2.5 The Supplier shall, in good time but at the latest by
the time of order confirmation, inform the Customer
in writing whether any open source licenses used
by Supplier might be subject to a Copyleft Effect,
which could affect the products of the Customer. In
the context of this provision, “Copyleft Effect”
means that the provision of the open source
license requires that certain of the Supplier’s
products, as well as any products derived from
such products, may only be redistributed in
accordance with the terms of the open source
license, e.g. only if the source code is disclosed. In
case any open source licenses used by Supplier
would be subject to a Copyleft Effect, the
Customer shall be entitled to cancel the order
within two weeks of receipt of such information
without any cost and liability consequences for the
Customer.
2.6 Should the order involve production with special
requirements in terms of a work contract, the

written approval of the Customer, nor shall such be
used for any own or other purpose.

claim damages as permitted by law.
3.4 If the agreed deadlines are exceeded, the
Customer may demand a penalty to the amount of
0.3 % for each commenced day of delay, but not
exceeding 10 % of the total contract amount. The
payment of a penalty by the Supplier shall not
affect any other contractual or legal rights based
on late delivery or performance and shall not
release the Supplier from any of its contractual or
legal obligations arising from the order.
3.5. In case of postponed or subsequently agreed
delivery or performance deadlines the agreed

given together with the information set out in
section 6.3 hereunder. On Customer’s request, a
Siemens Energy routing order tool must be used
by the Supplier. Transport shall be arranged by the
Supplier at the lowest possible cost, insofar as the
Customer has not requested a particular method
of delivery or the conclusion of the contract for
carriage by the Customer. Any supplementary
costs arising from non-conformity with the
transport requirements, including any costs arising
from the Supplier not having used the Siemens
Energy routing order, shall be borne by the
Supplier. In case DAP/DDP (place of destination)

the initial transport another transport with a
different mode of transport is scheduled, the
Supplier will also follow the relevant legal

be payable. Copies of invoices shall be marked as
duplicates.
7.3 The period for payment shall commence as soon
as any delivery or service is completed and a
correctly issued invoice is received. If the Supplier
is required to provide material testing, test records

documentation, such shall be a part of the
requirements of the completeness of the delivery
and service. A discount shall also be allowed for
should the Customer set off or withhold any
payments to a reasonable extent because of any
deficiency in the delivery or service; the period for
payment shall commence after the complete
rectification of any deficiency.
7.4 Payment does not constitute an acknowledgement
that the corresponding deliveries or services were
provided in accordance with the contract (in
particular in relation to quantity or quality). Any
rights of the Customer to claim shall therefore
remain unaffected also after payment for the
deliveries or services.
7.5 Default in payment by the Customer shall require

Page 3 of6
Unrestricteddue.

notification shall not apply. The Supplier
recognizes order notifications of defects without
adherence to a notification period as obtained in
time.

9.1 All claims in relation to rescission, price reduction,
rectification or replacement and damages shall be
reserved. A right to claim rectification shall also
exist in case of any purchase agreements.
Rectification or replacement shall be carried out by
the Supplier at the choice of the Customer. The
Supplier shall be liable for any and all costs,
expenses and damages resulting directly to the

accordance with the contract, or (ii) the parties

as but not limited to rescission, price reduction or
damages in a binding manner.

Supplier shall bear the risk for deficient deliveries.

install, re-construct, re-inspect and retest of
deficient deliveries as well as all other costs
(including internal costs), expenses and damage of
the Customer in connection with the complaint and
rectification of the deficiency.
9.5 Should the Supplier fail to rectify (i.e. repair or
replacement) within a reasonable time set by the
Customer, the Customer is entitled, at the
expense of the Supplier, to undertake any
rectification or replacement itself or arrange for a
third party to do so. Any deficiency in deliveries or
services detected at the time of acceptance,
inspection or commissioning may be rectified by
the Customer itself or it may arrange for such to be
rectified by third parties immediately at the
expense of the Supplier without the need to set a
further deadline if the Supplier delivered or
provided such in delay. The same shall apply if the
Customer has a particular interest in immediate
rectification or replacement delivery in case of
urgency or in order to avoid delay itself.
9.6 The warranty period shall be three years, unless a
longer warranty period is given by law.

commissioning, assembly the warranty period
begins to run with receipt at the place of destination

installation, erection, commissioning or assembly
as well as for services the warranty period begins

delivery to locations where the Customer isoperating outside its premises, the warranty period
begins by acceptance by the end customer, in no
case later than one year after the transfer of risk.

terms of the warranty, the warranty period shall
start anew. The warranty period shall extend for
the period during which the deliveries cannot be
used to the full extent as a result of deficiencies.
9.9 Warranty claims shall expire one year after expiry
of the warranty period set out in this section.
9.10 Any further or additional legal claims are reserved.
9.11 Inspections, directions or instructions by the
Customer or by any person acting on behalf of the
Customer shall not limit the right to claim under the
contract, in particular with regard to deficiencies.

reasonable or has other reservations against such,
the Supplier shall notify the Customer of such
without delay in writing and make suggestions for
improvement.

Supplier shall indemnify the Customer against all
costs (in particular including lawyers and court
costs) and justified claims of third parties in
connection with intellectual property rights.
10.3 In addition the Customer may demand that the
Supplier at its own expense and without delay

parts which do not infringe the intellectual property
rights.

responsibility of the Supplier in relation to its scope
of deliveries and services.

make available to third parties any data, drawings,
specifications, materials, knowledge or findings,
documents, terms of reference, business

or in case (b) that the adherence to the contract by
the Customer cannot reasonably be expected from
the Customer because of a reason attributable to
the Supplier and taking into consideration the

Supplier’s financial situation thus threatening the

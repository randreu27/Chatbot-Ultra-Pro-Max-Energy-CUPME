 3 About this Report  
 About this Repo rt
This Half -year Financial Report contains the Interim Group Management 
Report  and the Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements of Siemens 
Energy AG and its subsidiaries (“ Siemens Energy Group ”, “Siemens  En-
ergy ”, “the Group ”, “the Company ”, “our”  or “we”) as of March 31, 2021, 
as well as a Responsibility Statement. It complies with the requirements 
of Section 115 of the German Securities Tradin g Act (”Wertpapierhan-
delsgesetz”). This Half -year Financial Report should be read in conjunc-
tion with our Annual Report for fiscal year 2020, which includes a de-
tailed analysis of our operations and activities as well as explanations of 
financial measures used.  
The Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accord-
ance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) applicable 
to interim financial reporting as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) and as adopt ed by the European Union (EU).  
This document contains statements related to our future business and 
financial performance and future events or developments involving Sie-
mens  Energy , that may constitute forward -looking statements. These 
statements may be identified by words such as “expect”, “look forward 
to“, "anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “believe”, “seek”, “estimate”, “will”, 
“project” or words of similar meaning. We may also make  forward -look-
ing statements in other reports, prospectuses, presentations, material 
delivered to shareholders and  press releases. In addition, our represent-
atives may from time to time make verbal forward -looking statements. 
Such statements are based on th e current expectations and certai n as-
sumptions of Siemens  Energy’ s management, of which  many are be-
yond Siemens Energy’ s control. These are subject to a number of risks, 
uncertainties and factors, including, but not limited to those described 
in disclosure s, in particular in the chapters 1.7 Report on expected de-
velopments  and 1.8 Report on material risks and opportunities  of 
the Annual Report, and the corresponding chapters in the Half -year Fi-
nancial  Report. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainti es ma-
terialize, should  acts of force majeure, such as pandemics, occur, or 
should underlying expectations including future events occur at a later 
date or not at all, or should assumptions prove incorrect, Siemens  En-
ergy’ s actual results, performance, or a chievements may (negatively or 
positively) vary materially from those described explicitly or implicitly in 
the relevant forward -looking statement. Siemens  Energy neither in-
tends, nor assumes any obligation to update or revise these forward -
looking stateme nts in light of developments , which differ from those 
anticipated.  
This document includes in the applicable financial reporting framework 
not clearly defined supplemental financial measures , that are or may be 
alternative performance measures (non -GAAP -measures). These sup-
plemental financial measures should not be viewed in isolation , or as 
alternatives to measures of Siemens Energy ’s net assets and financial 
positions or results of operation s as presented in accordance with the 
applicable financial reporting framework in its Consolidated  Financial 
Statements. Other companies , that report or describe similarly titled al-
ternative performance measures , may calculate them differently.  Due to rou nding, numbers presented throughout this Half -year Finan-
cial Report , may not add up precisely to the totals provided , and per-
centages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.  
This document is an English language translation of the German docu-
ment. I n case of discrepancies, the German language document is the 
sole authoritative and universally valid version.  
For technical reasons, there may be differences between the accounting 
records appearing in this document and those  published pursuant to 
legal requirements.

Orders  
• Orders of Siemens  Energy grew both on a reported and comparable 
basis. Excluding portfolio and currency translation effects (compara-
ble basis), the increase was 6.6  %. The development of the two seg-
ments showed a mixed picture.  
• Gas and Power  (GP) showed a clear nominal decline of orders, 
amongst others due to a lower volume from large orders year -over -
year. All three businesses  reported declines. On a comparable basis, 
GP’s orde rs were almost at t he same level as prior year.  
• Orders at Siemens  Gamesa  Renewable  Energy  (SGRE) rose signifi-
cantly, mainly due to a higher volume from large orders. Among 
them were three contracts with a combined volume of  approxi-
mately €2.8  billion for offshore wind farms including service in the 
United Kingdom , the Netherlands and France.  The sharp increase in 
the offshore business  more than offset a  substantial  decline in the 
service business, the onshore business wa s almost stable at prior -
year’s level.  
• Book -to-bill rati o was at 1. 38. Order backlog amounted to  €84.2  bil-
lion, compared to €78.6  billion at prior fiscal year -end.  
• On a geographic basis, orders rose  significant ly in the reporting re-
gions Europe, C.I.S. , Africa, Middle East  (EMEA)  and clearly in  
Americas , while Asia, Australia  showed a substantial decline.  
• The development in the reporting region EMEA  was driven by  a 
sharp growth at SGRE, primarily due to the large orders mentioned 
above, which outweighed, on a nominal basis, the significant de-
crease at GP.  
• The increase in  the Americas  was due to  moderate  growth at SGRE, 
in particular due to a sharp rise in the U.S . resulting from  a large on-
shore order, as well as to clear  growth at GP resulting from large or-
ders in Canada  and Brazil . 
• Developm ent in Asia, Australia  was driven by a sharp decrease at 
SGRE, which more than offset a clear growth at GP. The high volume 
from large orders in  the first half of the fiscal year  2020  (H1 FY 2020 ) 
at SGRE , especially in Taiwan , had no comparable equivalent in the 
current fiscal year.  Revenue  
• Reported nominal r evenue decreased  slightly . On a comparable ba-
sis, revenue increased by 3.7  %. Revenue in the service business 
moderately decreased year -over-year due to a clear decline at GP.  
• GP showed a cle ar decrease due to  declines in all three businesses . 
Currency translations effects of 4.8  percentage points negatively im-
pacted the development. On a comparable basis, revenue decreased 
slightly by 1.6  %. 
• Revenue at SGRE rose clearly. This growth was driven by a substantial 
increase in the offshore  activities within WTG (wind turbine genera-
tor). The service business also contributed clearly to the growth 
whereas  onshore  revenue showed a slight decline  due to currency  
translation  effects . 
• Regional development of revenue followed a diffe rent pattern com-
pared to orders: Asia, Australia  and EMEA  showed increases while 
revenue in  the Americas  declined.  
• In the reporting region EMEA , significant revenue growth at SGRE 
more than offset a moderate decline at GP.  
• Both segments, primarily GP, showed a  significant revenue decrease 
in the Americas , which was mainly due to the decline in the U.S.  
• In Asia, Australia , revenue rose in both segments . Substantial 
growth at SGRE – due to strong prior -year ord ers, primarily in Taiwan 
– exceeded the  significant  increase at GP.

Adjusted EBITA  
• Adjusted EBITA was primarily influenced by operational improve-
ments , a different project  mix and lower costs year -over-year. Both 
segments reported higher results . 
• GP sharply increased  its Adjusted EBITA and improved profitability . In 
H1 FY 2021, there were positive one -time  effects in connection with 
a customer  settlement and a project termination. GP achieved oper-
ational improvements resulting in lower costs and benefited from 
temporary positive effects. These included effects from hedging 
transactions and lower discretiona ry spend ing. 
• SGRE also showed a sharp increase in its Adjusted EBITA, mainly be-
cause  the prior -year period  was impacted by substantial negative ef-
fects related to project delays in Northern Europe, COVID -19 and a 
slowdown in the Indian onshore market . H1 FY 2021 benefited from 
offshore volume effects , the reversal of warranty provisions associ-
ated with a lower rate of product failure , a reassessment of marketa-
bility of inventories  and lower maintenance costs.  Adjusted EBITA before Special items  
• Improvement of Adjusted EBITA before Special items exceeded the 
improvement of Adjusted EBITA due to substantially higher negative 
impacts from Special items.  
• The i ncrease in Special items was driven by sharpl y higher restructur-
ing and integration costs. In February 2021, Siemens  Energy an-
nounced further details regarding the competitiveness program of 
the GP segment. Impacts are expected on Adjusted EBITA in the sec-
ond half of FY 2021 while being predominantly  reported within Spe-
cial items.  The closure of two SGRE plants in Spain was announced 
in January 2021.  
• Strategic portfolio decisions benefited from a positive one -time ef-
fect at GP related to assets previously  written -off with regard to our 
decision to streamline our offering of aeroderivative gas turbines.  
Costs for a restructuring plan in India consisting in asset impair-
ments, which were reported und er strategic portfolio decisions in 
the prior period  at SGRE did not  recur  in the current period . 
• In addition,  stand -alone costs  (expenses associated with the setup of 
the stand -alone company) increased sharply year-over-year.

 Net I ncome (Loss), Basic Earnings per Share  
• The Group’s effective tax rate was 36.2 %. Items outside Germany 
such as the non -recognition of deferred tax assets on losses  in-
creas ed the rate . 
• Net income and corresponding basic earnings per share improved 
sharply and became positive .

Assets, liabilities and equity  
• In the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of March  31, 
2021  in comparison to the Consolidated Statements of Financial Po-
sition  as of September  30, 2020  amounts included in receivables 
from and payables to the  Siemens Group have been reclassified to 
those balance sheet items to which they belong according to their 
nature. The prior year amounts have been adjusted accordingly for 
comparability reasons.  
• Total assets  remained widely  unchanged compared to the end of 
last fiscal year. The same applied to the change in the respective to-
tals of current and non -current assets and liabilities . 
• Other current financial liabil ities decreased  substantially , partly 
due to the s ettlement of external payment transactions , the decrease 
in liabilities from share buy -backs and from the accelerated vesting 
of share -based payment  programs of Siemens AG .  
• Operating net working capital  decreased substantially  to €800 mil-
lion (September  30, 2020: €1,05 6 million)  due to asset manage-
ment . A moderate  increase in assets was  more than  offset by a mod-
erate  increase in liabilities.  
• Total debt  increased to €2, 938 million (September  30, 2020: 
€2,39 1 million), mainly due to  two new SGRE loans wi th the Euro-
pean Investment Bank  and new lease liabilities  (see Note  3 in 
2.6 Notes to  Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements ). • Provisions for pensions and similar obligations  decreased during 
H1 FY 2021  to €906 million (Sep tember  30, 2020: €1,057  million) 
mainly due to an increase in the assumed  average -weighted discount 
rate.  
• Total equity  was slightly above the level at  the end of the previous 
fiscal year. A positive total comprehensive income  was partially off-
set by the effects of the repurchase of treasury shares.  In H1 FY 2021 , 
7,691  thousand treasury shares were repurchased, thus completing 
the treasury share repurch ase program  announced in Septem-
ber 2020 . 
  
10 
Siemens Energy  – Half-year Financial Report 2021  Interim Group Management Report  
 Cash flows  
• Free cash flow pre tax  sharply improved in H1 FY 2021  and was 
positive. That was driven by the improved result and cash inflows re-
sulting from the  change in Operating net working capital of 
€300 million (H1  FY 2020: € 156 million) . This was partly offset by 
increased cash outflows from  the change in O ther assets and liabili-
ties of € 962 million (H1  FY 2020: € 470 million), including cash out-
flows from the accelerated vesting of share -based payment  pro-
grams of Siemens AG .  
• At segment level, sharp improvements  in Free cash flow  pre tax  at 
GP, driven by project -related cash inflows , were in part offset  by a 
sharp  decline at SGRE . The determining factor was that  within the  
prior  year period , SGRE benefited strongly from customer prepay-
ments due to high er level of  order intake.   • Cash flows from investing  activities  in H1 FY 202 0 included out-
flows related to SGRE’s acquisition of parts of the Senvion business. 
This was  partly  offset by lower inflows from the sale of minor  busi-
ness activities  of GP . 
• The year -over-year de crease in Cash flow from financing activities  
was mainly due to the purchase  of treasury shares  as well as sharply 
lower cash  inflows from  transactions with the Siemens Group.  
• Siemens Energy's Net cash  - determined by total debt less total li-
quidity - decreased to €1, 576 million as of March  31, 2021 (Septem-
ber 30, 2020: €2, 366 million ).

 1.3 Outlook
Against the background of the business development in the first half of 
the fiscal year coupled with greater visibility on the remainder of the 
fiscal year, we refine  our outlook for the nominal revenue growth for 
Siemens Energy and both segments. Our orig inal outlook included a 
wider range for the expected growth rate reflecting a high level of un-
certainty at that time regarding factors, amongst others, the global 
COVID -19 pandemic.  
We now expect the nominal revenue growth rate for Siemens Energy  
in fiscal  year 2021 to be in the range of 3% to 8% (previously 2% to 
12%). Unchanged, we expect an Adjusted EBITA margin before Special 
items of 3% to 5%, a sharp increase in Net income and a sharp decrease 
of Free cash flow pre tax.  
For our GP segme nt in fiscal ye ar 2021 we now expect nominal reve-
nue growth to be in the range of 2% to 6% (previously 2% to 11%). Ad-
justed EBITA margin before Special items is anticipated unchanged be-
tween 3.5% and 5.5%.  For our SGRE segment  we now expect nominal revenue growth in the  
range of 8% to 11% (previously 8% to 18%). Adjusted EBITA margin be-
fore Special items is expected to be unchanged in a range of 3% to 5% 
in fiscal year 2021.  
We continue to expect global macroeconomic development to remain 
subdued for the remaining fiscal  year 2021, with risks particularly re-
lated to geopolitical and geo -economic uncertainties. Our markets tend 
to have a limited effect to economic cycles and our businesses, espe-
cially our service business, is characterized by a high level of resilience.  
This guidance continues to assume limited financial impact from COVID -
19 during fiscal year 2021. Nevertheless, we observe with concern the 
resurgence of the global COVID -19 pandemic and measures imposed by 
authorities. We continue to monitor the pandemic si tuation and evalu-
ate appropriate measures as it pertains to our guidance.  
This outlook excludes charges related to legal and regulatory matters.

 1.4 Risks and opportuniti es 
In our Annual Report for fiscal year 2020  we described certain risks 
which could have a material adverse effect o n our business, financial 
condi tion (including effec ts on assets, liabilities and cash flows), results 
of operations and reputation, our most significant opportunities as well 
as the design of our risk management system.  
During the reporting period, we identified no further significant risks 
and opportuniti es besides those presented in our Annual Report for fis-
cal year 2020  and in this Half -year Financial Report . 
For additional information related to specific litigations please see Note 
6 in 2.6 Notes to Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements . Assessment of the overall risk situation  
While our assessments of individual risks have been continuously up-
dated during the first half of fiscal year 2021 , due to developments in 
the external environment, effects of our own mitigation measures and 
the rev ision of our risk assessment, the overall risk situation for Siemens 
Energy did not change significantly as compared to the prior year . We 
currently see the strategic risks arising from disruptive development s 
such as the trend towards decarbonization, inc luding the requirements 
from certain ESG standards, as the most significant challenge for us, 
followed by the operational risk arising from the COVID -19 pandemic 
disease.  
Additional risks and opportunities not known to us or t hat we currently 
consider immaterial could also affect our business operations. At pre-
sent, no risks have been identified that either individually or in combi-
nation with other risks could endanger our ability to continue as a going 
concern.

Siemens Energy  – Half-year Financial Report 2021  Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements  
 NOTE 1 Basis of presentation
The accompanying Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements as of 
March  31, 2021, present the operations of Siemens  Energy  AG with 
registered office in Munich, Germany (registry number HRB 252581), 
and its subsidiaries.  
The Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements are in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) applicable to interim 
financia l reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB) and as adopted by the European Union (EU). The Half -year 
Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with 
the Siemens Energy Consolidated Financial Statements as of Septem-
ber 30, 2020.  
The Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements apply the same ac-
counting principles and practices as those used in the 2020 Consoli-
dated F inancial Statements. The "Consolidated Statement of Income", 
the "Consolidated Statement of  Comprehensive Income", the "Consoli-
dated Statement of Cash Flows" and the “Consolidated Statement  of 
Changes in Equity” for the prior  year period have been prepared based 
on the Combined Financial Statements.  
In the Half -year Consolidated Financial Statem ents as of March  31, 
2021 in comparison to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of Sep-
tember  30, 2020 amounts included in receivables from and payables to 
the Siemens Group have been reclassified to those balance sheet items 
to which they belong accord ing to their nature . The prior -year amounts 
have been adjusted accordingly for comparability reasons. Income tax 
expense s in the interim periods are calculated based on the currently 
expected effective tax rate of Siemens  Energy for the full year.  
Results for the interim reporting period are not necessarily indicative of 
future results. The presentation of certain prior  year information is re-
classified to conform to the current year presentation. The Half -year 
Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited  and were authorized 
for issue by the Executive  Board on April  30, 2021 . For further infor-
mation on changes in estimates including income taxes and pensions, 
disaggregation of revenue and on segment information, see disclosures 
in the In terim Group Managem ent Report.  
Siemens  Energy is one of the largest suppliers of technology in the en-
ergy and electri city sector that  serves  the entire scope of the energy 
market. It provid es a portfolio along the entire energy value chain in 
both conventional and renewable energy, complimented  by an entire  
set of tra ining and service offerings. This comprehensi ve portfolio is 
aimed at public and private sector c ustomers along the continuum of 
energy – from power g eneration to power transmissio n and related ser-
vices . Description of reportable segments  
Siemens Energy has two reportable segments:  
• Gas and Power (GP), which offers a broad spectrum of products , so-
lutions  and services  for the generation of energy along the entire 
value chain in the oil and gas industry, as well as the construction 
and operation of power transmission networks.  
 
• Siemens  Gamesa  Renewable  Energy (SGRE), which offers on  and off-
shore wind turbines as well as services throughout the whole life cy-
cle of wind turbines.  
Siemen s Energy reviews assets for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying  
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company’s exit from 
new coal projects announced  in November  2020 did not result in  any 
impairment as of March  31, 2021.  
In fiscal year 2021, Siemens  Energy ’s business and economic environ-
ment was adversely affected by the spread of COVID -19, though certain 
mitigating effects materialized due to the various measures  taken by 
governments or states globally, including favorable financial support. 
As the outbreak continues to evolve, it is challenging to predict its du-
ration and its impact on assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash 
flows. In the Half -year Co nsolidated Financial Statements as of 
March  31, 2021 Siemens  Energy cautiously based financial information 
related estimates and assumptions on existing knowledge and the best 
information available and applied a scenario assuming that no signifi-
cant negati ve effects will result in fiscal year 2021. COVID -19 related 
impacts on Siemens  Energy ’s Half -year Consolidated Financial State-
ments may inter alia result from delays in order placements as well as 
in executing orders and contracts, termination of contract s, adjusted or 
modified revenue and cost patterns, limited usage of assets, volatility in 
financial and commodity markets, limited or no access to customer fa-
cilities, interest rate adjustments in various countries, increasing vola-
tility in foreign currenc y exchange rates, deteriorating creditworthiness, 
credit default or delayed payments and hardship in preparing predic-
tions and forecasts due to uncertainties in the amount and timing of 
cash flows. Those factors may impact fair value and carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities as well as the amount and timing of results of 
operations and cash flows. These circumstances require complex and 
subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may 
be for matters that are inherently uncertain and s usceptible to change. 
Siemens Energy believes that  the assumptions applied appropriately re-
flect the current situation.

 NOTE  2 Acquisitions
For the acquisitions of Senvion Deutschland GmbH (Senvion European 
Onshore Services)  and of Senvion’s wind turbine blade production busi-
ness in Vagos (Portugal)  as well as certain additional assets (Ria Blades, 
S.A.) in fiscal year 2020, the adjustment of the total purchase price 
within the established limits  was resolve d in March 2021 , once the term 
for the confirmation of the closing accounts ha d elapsed.  The total price 
has amounted to €182  million , having recognized negative adjust-
ments in the closing a ccounts confirmation, reaching the price floor . 
Likewise, the allocation of the resulting total price to the different parts 
of the transaction s has been completed. The breakdown of the consid-
eration paid was €122 million for the Senvion European Onshore S er-
vices  business  and €60 million for the wind turbine blade production 
business in Vagos (Portugal) and certain additional assets associated 
with said business. These amounts we re paid during fiscal year 2020 . 
The transaction  costs associated to both trans actions amounted to 
€13 million and were recorded  mainly in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income  for fiscal year 2020.

 NOTE 5  Commitments and contingencies  
Siemens Energy issues guarantees of third -party performance, which 
mainly include performance bonds and guarantees of  advanced pay-
ments in consortium  arrangements . In the event of a claim under the 
guarantees, Siemens Energy will be required to pay up to the agreed -
upon maximum amount of  €216  million as of March  31, 2021 (Septem-
ber 30, 2020: €272 million). These agreements typically have terms of 
up to ten years. Besides the guarantees issued by Siemens Energy dur-
ing the periods presented, Siemens Group has provided additional guar-
antees for Siemens  Energy business for which Siemens Group has a re-
course right to Siemens Energy in case of any drawing on the se 
guarantees.  
In addition, the Company issued other guarantees, including indemni-
fications in connection with the disposition of businesses. To  the extent 
future claims are not considered remote,  maximum future payments 
from these obligations amount ed to €58 million as of March  31, 2021 
(September  30, 2020: €60 million).  
Moreover, Siemens Energy AG acting  as a partner in commercial part-
nerships , has  capital contribution obligations and is jointly and severally 
liable fo r the partnerships’ liabilities.  
 
NOTE 6 Legal proceedings  
In January 2021, General Electric Company filed a complaint against 
Siemens Energy, Inc. , USA  (“SEI”) in a US federal court asserting various 
claims regarding the receipt of confidential competitor information and 
seeking unspecified damages. SEI is defending  itself against the claims . 
In connection with the previously reported intellectual property related 
claim filed by GE against SGRE in Germany, GE has filed two additional 
claims against SGRE in the United Kingdom and Spain based on the re-
spective national counterparts of the patent which is subject of the liti-
gation in Germany. SGRE is defending itself a gainst the claims.  
SGRE  is currently investigating a number of allegations and indications 
of potential violations of internal policies and procedures, as well as of 
statutory laws. The investigations concern mainly the Indian subsidiary, 
and a limited num ber of other jurisdictions. The respective internal in-
vestigations are still ongoing. Except for immaterial amounts recog-
nized as of March  31, 2021, at the current stage of these investigations, 
it is too early to predict the final outcome, and to assess p otential legal 
consequences and quantify potential financial impact s. If these allega-
tions and indications are confirmed this could result in SGRE or its re-
spective subsidiaries being subject to payment of damages, equitable 
remedies, fines, penalties, pro fit disgorgements, disqualifications from 
engaging in certain types of business as well as additional liabilities.

Fair values of derivative financial instruments are in accordance with 
the specific type of instrument. Fair values of derivative interest rate 
contracts are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows us-
ing current market interest rates and yield curves over the remaining 
term of the instrument. Fair values of foreign currency derivatives are 
based on forward exchange rates. No compensating effects from un-
derlying transactions (e.g., firm commitments and forecast transac-
tions) are taken into consideration.  The fair value of equity instruments measured at fair value is estimated 
by discounting future cash flows using current market interest rates. 
The fair value of debt instruments is estimated by dis counting future 
cash flows using current market interest ra tes.

In the GP segment,  inventory  write -offs amounting  to €206  million  and 
impairments  of intangible  assets  amounting  to €476  million  were  rec-
ognized  in the past fiscal  year in connection  with  strategic  portfolio  de-
cisions  for aeroderivative  gas turbines.  Despi te further negative cus-
tomer developments in the fiscal year 2021 a purchase agreement was 
concluded for gas turbines on stock resulting in a partial reversal of the 
respective write -offs.  Further  positive  non-recurring  items  resulted  
among  other  things  from a settlement  with  a major  customer,  which  
led to the reversal  of the corresponding  provisions  for delays  and war-
ranties.  
In the SGRE  segment,  a reassessment  of marketability  of inventories  re-
sulted  in a positive  impact in a high  double -digit  million  euro  amount.  
Further  positive  effects  resulted  from  the release  of warranty  provisions.

Supply and delivery agreements exist between Siemens Energy and Sie-
mens Group. Siemens Energy is supplied with  and delivers to S iemens 
Group goods and services on a case by case basis. In ce rtain countries, 
Siemens  Energy ’s Gas and Power business is carried out under agency 
and distributorship agreements that were concluded between Sie-
mens  Energy  Global  GmbH  & Co. KG and the respec tive local Siemens 
Group companies.  
During the Carve -Out, some contracts could not be or were not yet le-
gally transferred from Siemens Group to Siemens Energy. These con-
tracts are generally subcontracted from Siemens Group to Siemens En-
ergy with recourse to Siemens Energy in respect to risks. Provisions that 
Siemens Energy has recognized for warranties, litigations , and other 
project -related risks relating to such contracts amount ed to €843 mil-
lion as of March  31, 2021 (September  30, 2020: € 919 million) . 
In the first half of fiscal year 2021, Siemens Energy recei ved central cor-
porate services from Siemens Group resulting in expenses of €267  mil-
lion (first half of fiscal year 2020: €524  million). Siemens Energy pays a 
fee for the use of the Siemens brand.  
Guarantees and other commitments  
Siemens Group has issued guarantees and similar declarations of liabil-
ity in favor of Siemens Energy and its investments. The volume 
amount ed to €21,533  million as of March  31, 2021 (September  30,

Siemens Energy issued guarantees for Siemens Group entities and Sie-
mens Energy ’s own joint ventures amounting to €221 million  as of 
March  31, 2021 (September  30, 2020: €294 million).  
Additionally, Siemens Energy has a commitment related to an agree-
ment between Siemens Energy and  the Siemens  Group  that obliges Sie-
mens Energy to acquire a 40%  share  in the joint venture Shanghai Elec-
tric Power Generation Equipment Co. LTD., Shanghai, China, in fiscal 
year 2021 (subject to the consent of the joint venture partner). The ex-
pected purchase price of €220  million for the share has been contrib-
uted in cash by the Siemens Group to Siemens Energy in advance , with 
any difference to be repaid to the Siemens Group should  the purchase 
price be less than €220  million . The commitment in c onnection with  
the acquisition of the Siemens Energy business in Bangladesh  from  the 
Siemens  Group  was settled in the first half of fiscal year 2021 . The pur-
chase price was €23  million.  Insurances  
Siemens  Energy  (excluding SGRE)  is covered by the group in surance of 
Siemens Group. Siemens  Energy is covered under the industrial and 
cyber insurances of Siemens Group but has its own financial insurance . 
Furthermore, there are additional contracts for individual insurance ser-
vices between companies of Siemens  Energy and Siemens Group, the 
costs of which are borne by Siemens  Energy.

 3.2 Review Repo rt
To Siemens  Energy  AG, Munich  
We have  reviewed  the half-year consolidated  financial  statements  com-
prising  the consolidated  statements  of income,  comprehensive  income,  
financial  position,  cash  flows  and changes  in equity,  and notes  to half-
year consolidated  financial  statements,  and the interim  group  manage-
ment  report,  of Siemens  Energy  AG, Munich  for the period  from  October  
1, 2020  to March  31, 2021  which  are part of the half-year financial  re-
port pursuant  to Sec. 115 WpHG  (“Wertpapierhandelsgesetz”:  German  
Securities  Trading  Act).  The Company’s  management  is responsible  for 
the preparation  of the half-year consolidated  financial  statements  in ac-
cordance  with  IFRS applicable  to interim  financial  reporting  as issued  by 
the IASB  and as adopted  by the EU and of the interim  group  manage-
ment  report  in accordance  with  the requirements  of the WpHG  applica-
ble to interim  group  management  reports.  Our responsibility  is to issue  
a report  on the half-year consolidated  financial  statements  and the in-
terim  group  management  report  based  on our review.  
We conducted  our review  of the half-year consolidated  financial  state-
ments  and the interim  group  management  report  in compliance  with  
German  Generally  Accepted  Standards  for the Review  of Financial  State-
ments  promulgated  by the Institut  der Wirtschaftsprüfe r (IDW  - Institute  
of Public  Auditors  in Germany)  and in supplementary  compliance  with  
International  Standard  on Review  Engagements  2410,  “Review  of In-
terim  Financial  Information  Performed  by the Independent  Auditor  of 
the Entity”.  Those  standards  require  that we plan  and perform  the re-
view  to obtain  a certain  level  of assurance  in our critical  appraisal  to 
preclude  that the half-year consolidated  financial  statements  are not 
prepared,  in all material  respects,  in accordance  with  IFRS applicable  to 
interim  financial  reporting  as issued  by the IASB  and as adopted  by the 
EU and that the interim  group  management  report  is not prepared,  in 
all material  respects,  in accordance  with  the requirements  of the WpHG  
applicable  to interim  group  management  reports.  A review is limited  
primarily  to making  inquiries  of the Company’s  employees  and analyti-
cal assessments  and therefore  does  not provide  the assurance  obtaina-
ble from  an audit  of financial  statements.  Since,  in accordance  with  our 
engagement,  we have  not performe d an audit  of financial  statements,  
we cannot  issue  an auditor’s  report . 
Based  on our review  nothing  has come  to our attention  that causes  us

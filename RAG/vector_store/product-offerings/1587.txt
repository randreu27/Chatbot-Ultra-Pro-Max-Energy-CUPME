Voluntary cash tender offer commenced
OnNovember 7,theCNMV approved thecash tender offer (CTO) to
acquire alloutstanding shares inSGRE .The acceptance period
commenced onNovember 8andisscheduled torunthrough Dec.13.New company structure
Since October 1,thenew group structure isbroader and flatter .Itisa
structure with distinct accountabilities and avery clear business
orientation .
Furthermore, Siemens Energy isharmonizing itsgotomarket approach,
will improve itsoperational excellence and channel itsinnovation
towards ourfivefields ofaction todrive growth .
Weappointed twonew board members inSeptember .AsofNovember 1,
Anne -Laure deChammard joined Siemens Energy from Engie toassume
therole ofHead ofTransformation ofIndustry .Anne -Laure has been
responsible forENGIE’s Energy Solutions business, andshehasextensive
global management experience inthe areas ofindustrial and energy
services, strategy, innovation andresearch &technology .
From October 1,Vinod Phillip willshape theGlobal Functions notonly to
belean, butalso tosupport Siemens Energy’s value creation objectives .
Vinod hasbeen with Siemens for24years and hashad several important
roles such asCEO ofPower Generation Services and until theend of
September Chief Technology andStrategy Officer .
Higher reporting transparency
Thenew group structure with 3reporting segments alongside SGRE willalso
allow ustoprovide more transparency toour stakeholders .The table
below provides anoverview onthedisclosure level going forward .
The key value drivers for Gas Services, Grid Technologies,
Transformation ofIndustry and therein the independently managed
businesses willbereported onaquarterly basis .
We also adjust our profit definition asoffiscal year 2023 .We are
removing themetric financial income from ourprofit andoperating business .
Thenew profit definition reflects aclean operational perspective onour
business performance andeasily reconciles with ourprofit &lossstatement .
We expect theresults ofthe
tender tobepublished and the
payment tobesettled before
Christmas 2022 .
IfSiemens Energy reaches a
shareholding of75%bytheend
oftheacceptance period, itwill
take the necessary steps to
initiate thedelisting process in
January .This would open a
second tender, which would run
until anEGM .The expected
delisting would then probably
take place inFebruary 2023 .If
Siemens Energy reaches a
holding ofmore than 96.71%,it
would beable toexecute a
squeeze out.Inthis case the
transaction value would amount
toapproximately €4.0bn.
Weremain committed toasolid investment grade rating .The financing
ofthetransaction, including ourintention toraise upto€2.5bnwith equity or
equity likeinstruments, isdesigned tosupport thiskeyobjective .Wealready
placed amandatory convertible bond with anominal value of€960mon
September 6.Since wealready had €1.15bnofcash pledged forthe
transaction ,wewere able toreduce thebridge facility to€2bn.This
facility isinplace foruptotwoyears .

Q4 FY2022 Siemens Energy Shareholder Letter 4Prospects for using hydrogen in gas power plants 
are becoming tangible
EnBW andSiemens Energy arejointly driving thetrend of
using green hydrogen asaclimate -friendly fuel infuture
power plants .One important pilot project istheEnBW
district heating power plant inStuttgart -Münster, Germany,
where natural gas isexpected toinitially replace coal in
approximately three years .
Allsystems areconstructed from thevery beginning insuch
away thatthenatural gascanbereplaced with hydrogen
asquickly and completely aspossible .Two cutting -edge
SGT-800 gas turbines from Siemens Energy areatthe
heart oftheinstallation .
The twonew turbines each have anelectrical output of62
megawatts andadownstream waste heat recovery system .
They arereplacing thethree coal-fired boilers that have
been atthelocation untilnow.
The project teams atboth companies arealso planning for
hydrogen’s future beyond the gas turbines .“Pipelines,
control systems, and boiler technology also have tobe
converted asquickly and easily aspossible when green
hydrogen isavailable,” EnBW engineer Diana van den
Bergh explained .EnBW islooking atatimeframe of10to
12years .
Intheagreements, Siemens Energy provides assurance
that thenew turbines willbeable toprocess uptoa75
percent hydrogen admixture from thetime they’re shipped
in2025 ,andtheoverall package isprepared tohandle 100
percent hydrogen .

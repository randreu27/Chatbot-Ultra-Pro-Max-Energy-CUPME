subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those described in disclosures , in particular in the chapter “Report on expected 
developments and associated material opportunities and risks” in the Annual Report. Should one or more of these risks or unce rtainties materialize, should acts of force majeure, 
such as pandemics, occur, or should underlying expectations including future events occur at a later date or not at all, or s hould assumptions prove incorrect, Siemens Energy ´s 
actual results, performance, or achievements may (negatively or positively) vary materially from those described explicitly o r implicitly in the relevant forward -looking statement.

Gas Field Policy 26:  Order Cancellation Policy 
 
When a purchase order is received, it is accepted in good faith. In order to meet our quoted ship date, 
immediate action is required by multiple departments. This  includes Engineering, Bill of Material generation and 
material planning with the ordering of any long lead-time components, and Production Planning. A Purchase 
Order cancellation, even very early within the order, has  a significant cost impact on  the factory. Likewise, a 
Purchase Order cancellation later in the schedule usually  results in a loss of factory productive capacity. 
 
For these reasons, Siemens Energy has established t he amount of Cancellation Charges as a percentage of the 
total order value relative to the percentage of time elapsed for the scheduled delivery of an order. See Siemens 
Energy Form MD001.  
When notification is received that an order is to be he ld up, cancellation charges based upon this schedule will 
be presented to the Purchaser to assist him in determini ng whether to cancel the order or proceed with work. An 
indefinite "hold up" is not acceptable.  An early decision must be reached as to cancellation or release to 
complete the equipment. Upon cancellation, all material becomes the property of the Supplier. 
 Additional cancellation charges may apply to orders that  have very specialized equipment and will be addressed 
on a case-by-case basis. Likewise, orders that have special circumstances will be reviewed on a case-by-case 
basis.  
Major changes to orders after entry, such as cylinder size or type changes -- or frame stroke changes -- will also 
be evaluated for cancellation charges on a case-by-case basis.

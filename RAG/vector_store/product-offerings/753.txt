This makes it necessary for operators to shut down and 
clean the check valves every 3-6 months to keep the en-
gine operating properly. 
Applicable to Gas Engines  
A fouled check valve can cause the engine to misfire 
resulting in high hydrocarbon emissions and potential 
damage to the engine. In addition, the pre-chamber 
injection event is mechanically fixed and can’t be optimized 
for different operating conditions. The Electronic Pre-
Combustion Chamber Injector (ePCi) is ideal for slow speed, 
two and four-stroke integral gas compression engines. In 
addition, clients with medium speed gas compression 
engines can benefit from this product. 
ePCi
To address this issue, Siemens Energy has developed a 
simple yet effective Electronic Pre-Combustion Chamber 
Injector which allows for increased reliability and durability 
compared to a standard mechanical pre-combustion 
chamber. It uses an electro-magnet to force the valve open and closed by spring instead of relying on the standard 
presurred differential-based mechanical check valve. 
This ePCi system enables control of the start-of-admission 
and end-of-admission events, minimizing contamination 
during cylinder scavenging and giving precision fuel 
admission control for improved fuel mixture tuning across 
all loads and speeds. 
The ePCi control hardware can be full integrated with 
existing systems or comes in a standalone sub-panel built 
to the end-user’s specific requirements.  
Features and Benefits
 Reduces engine component due to reduced misfires or 
incomplete ignition
 Increases time between maintenance intervals from 3-
6 months to 24 months
 Eliminates sticking PCC check valves
 Reduced hydrocarbon emissions
 Easier engine startups 
 Precise fuel admission control
 Faster troubleshooting of engine issues
 Operators and engine analysts save time due to no 
longer having to continuously monitor engine fuelingsiemens-energy.comElectronic Pre -Combustion

AGM. We received encouraging comments for most of the agenda items as well as critical inputs for 
some other topics. T he overarching  concern was clearly about the independence of the chairman of 
the audit committee.  
As I have laid out in my previous letter, we see Ralf Thomas as a highly suited  candidate to fill this role 
for an interim period, given his high est level s of expertise and experience.  While this assessment has 
been widely shared in terms of competence, the formal requirement for a fully independent audit chair 
has been clearly reiterated by most investors.  
To address the above -mentioned  concerns  properly , Ralf T homas has agreed to  resign from the role 
as a chairman of the audit committee by the next AGM in February 2022 . This will  allow  the migra tion 
of this role to a  fully  independent member  and chairperson for the audit committee while securing Mr. 
Thomasâ€™ expe rtise for  a proper transition of Siemens Energy in the first year after the spin -off. 
In the meantime, the nomination committee of the supervisory board  will start the process in a timely 
manner to secure another highly qualified , but independent candidate to take his role of the 
chair person  of the audit committee  latest after the  completion of the AGM 2022 . 
 
 
 
 
Joe Kaeser  
Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy AG

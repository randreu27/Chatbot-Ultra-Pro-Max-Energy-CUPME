Advanced engineering for Subsea Systems© 2021 Siemens Energy Page 4Decarbonisation, digitalisation, and 
electr  i fication are three major trends 
that are influencing the infrastructure, 
products and processes across the oil  
and gas market. Their presence has certainly been recognised in Europe  
in recent times, but their reach is now being felt on a global scale as they  
gain momentum and motivate change throughout our industry.
These trends combined have resulted in 
a significant drive to create all-electric 
installations by establishing subsea 
tiebacks, saving on the construction of 
new platforms or FPSOs. The result is 
lower capital expenditure, reduced oper -
ating costs, and a greater availability of data to monitor the status of the system. Opportunity  
through agility 
As fields become deeper and step out 
distances become longer, we see the chal-lenges our customers face in achieving dynamic and productive systems that are 
also cost-effective and profitable. 
Siemens Energy’s subsea connectors and 
sensors introduce the agility our customers 
need to enable the digitalisation of their 
technology and create a smarter way to 
produce oil. The introduction of fiber-optic 
technology has been revolutionary in 
increasing efficiency, improving recovery, 
and boosting revenue for operators. 
Digitalisation allows customers to use our 
products to remotely monitor their subsea 
production system, with the harvested data 
generating the ability to operate more 
effectively over longer periods of time. The 
result is significant cost saving and minimal 
environmental impact. There is higher 
availability of systems, higher up-time, and 
less maintenance cost. Advanced engineering

Siemens Energy has a long and distin-
guished track record for the successful 
delivery of subsea sensors. With thousands 
of sensors currently installed in projects 
globally, their innovative design and proven 
reliability are the attributes that allow  
us to retain our position as market leader. 
Our products are widely recognised for their 
high quality, low subsea failure rate, and 
excellent performance for remaining accu-
rate over time. Since our first subsea sensor 
was engineered in 1988, they have proven 
extremely reliable with low drift, which is 
why more than 30 years after installation they are still in specification. 
WEPS Sensors
High-quality subsea pressure, 
temperature and dP sensors
Advanced engineering for Subsea Systems© 2021 Siemens Energy Page 28WEPS-100:  
Modular, configurable, 
 competitive.  
The WEPS-100 subsea pressure and temperature sensor is 
our current market leading product, and for good reason. 
It’s configurability gives it a flexibility that benefits our 
customers and with more than 5,000 units produced since 
2010, it’s certainly proven in use. The WEPS-100 is fully 
compatible with the Siemens Energy DigiTRON connector 
range, with direct bulkhead connection possible (pictured 
above). This sensor has been designed to be modular with 
many output protocol variant and flange variant options 
available; we also offer an extended housing version  
for insulated applications. It delivers consistently high reliability and stability and is unsurpassed in accurately 
communicating critical information from subsea wells. WEPS-900:  
Accurate, high-performance, 
field-proven features.  
The WEPS-900 sensor has been designed to meet the tough 
demands of applications classed as high temperature 
(205  °C  /  400°F) and high pr essure (20,000 PSI instead of 
15,000 PSI). The engineering design of the WEPS-900 
incorporates qualified and field-proven features that are 
included in the WEPS-100 sensor along with a unique 
non-welded containment system. It is tested and demon-
strated to deliver a high-accuracy performance whilst 
maintaining stability.

Future proofed, cost effective, 
stable.  
The WEPS-300 subsea pressure and temperature sensor is 
our next generation, competitive, future proofed sensor. It 
is production optimized, focusing on standardization, with 
reduced part numbers and less variants. As with all sensors 
in the WEPS range it has been engineered and manufac -
tured to the highest quality and has advanced features 
allowing compliance with technical specifications. It has 
the qualities of accuracy, stability, reliability, and perfor -
mance that Siemens Energy Subsea sensors are valued for. 
Like the WEPS-100, with the WEPS-300 we offer an 
extended housing option for insulated applications.SDP-6:  
Precise, durable, market leading.  
The SDP-6 differential pressure sensor is a highly reliable 
product for its highly precise measurement of differential 
pressure. This sensor utilises a remote seal system to 
prevent process pollution and hydrate formation that 
directly affect pressure measurement. This product is 
known across the oil and gas industry for its quality and 
superior manufacturing, clearly demonstrated by its long 
history and catalogue of successful projects. The SDP-6 is 
valued for its high accuracy, stability, and excellent high 
line pressure capability, which is what makes it a market 
leading product.

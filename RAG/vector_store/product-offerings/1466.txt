 
 Earnings Release  Q1 FY 202 3 
October  1 to December  31, 2022 
Munich, Germany , February 7,  2023 – Siemens Energy  today announced  its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 202 3 that ended December  31, 202 2. 
Strong underlying performance notwithstanding charges at S GRE – outlook for fiscal 
year 2023  adjusted  
“Our order  growth  demonstrates  that we have the right portfolio to capitalize on the energy transition. Notwithstanding the charges at Siemens Gamesa, 
Jochen Eickholt and h is team are making progress in improving the sustainability  of the company. The intended delisting of Siemens Gamesa will further support 
the team to focus on solving the operational problems and the turnaround ”, says Christian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy AG.  
• Despite the subdued overall economic development, Siemens Energy’s market environment remained favorable . During the  quarter , Grid Technologies (GT) 
was awarded  the largest offshore grid connection order in Siemens Energy's history . The platforms will connect  several offshore wind farms in the (German ) 
North Sea to the on shore  grid. 
• Siemens Energy delivered strong order and revenue growth and better than expected cash flow. A strong ly improved  operational p erformance  at Gas 
Services (GS), GT, and Transformation of Industry (TI) was more than offset by charges of €0.5bn at Siemens Game sa Renewable Energy (SGRE). During an 
evaluation of the installed fleet , SGRE  detected a negative development of failure rates in specific components resulting in higher warranty and service 
maintenance cost assumptions . 
• Orders continued to be very strong.  Comparable growth (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) was 49.2% despite a high basis of comparison, 
resulting in orders of €12.7bn , supported by large orders especially at GT. The Book -to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) was 1.80 and th e order backlog 
rose to €98.8bn despite material negative currency translation effects.  
• Revenue came in at  €7.1bn reflecting  a 16.0% increase on a comparable basis . All segments contributed to th is growth . 
• Siemens Energy’s Profit  before Special items was negative € 282m (Q1 FY 202 2: negative € 69m) due to the charges  at SGRE . GS and GT reported sharp 
improvements year -over -year  and TI delivered a positive result . Special items were ne gative with €103m (Q 1 FY 202 2: positive  €6m) mainly driven  by 
restructuring costs at SGRE . As a result , Profit for Siemens Energy was negative €384m (Q 1 FY 202 2: negative € 64m). 
• Accordingly, Siemens Energy reported  a Net loss of €598m (Q 1 FY 202 2: Net loss € 246m). Corresponding basic earnings per share (EPS) were negative €0.60 
(Q1 FY 202 2: negative €0. 18). 
• Free cash flow pre tax was negative with  €58m (Q1 FY 2022: negative €69m), mainly driven by cash outflows at SGRE . Overall,  the development was better 
than expected , supported by  advance payments from customers in relation to the strong order  development . 
• Due to the aforementioned charges at  SGRE, Siemens Energy had to adjust  its outlook for fiscal year 2023. Management now expects Siemens Energy 
Group’s Profit margin before Special items between 1% and 3%  and Net loss of Siemens Energy Group  to be on prior fiscal year’s reported level . Due to the 
better than expected  cash flow development during the  quarter, management now expects Free cash flow pre tax for fiscal year 2023 to be positive.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beginning with fiscal year 2023, Siemens Energy changed its reporting structure : The former Gas and Power segment was replaced by the segments GS, GT 
and TI (voluntarily reported as segment). C entral items  previously reported under  Gas and Power are now presented  in Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial 
Statements . Also starting with fiscal year 2023, Adjusted EBITA was replaced by Profit  which definition now excludes the financial result fro m operations. For 
more information see Siemens Energy’s Annual Report 2022. Prior -year figures are presented on a comparable basis. In addition, prior -year figures have been 
adjusted  due to a change in accounting policies regarding  derivative financial ins truments.

rency translation effects . 
• Year-over -year increase in revenue driven by growth in all segments . 
• Strong service revenue w as in line with overall revenue growth.  
• Profit before Special items sharply decreased due to the loss at SGRE. 
Strong progr ess in other three segments was driven by  higher revenue and 
operational improvements . 
• Negative i mpact from Special items mainly due to increased restructuring 
costs at SGRE . Prior-year quarter included a positive effect related to stra-
tegic portfolio decisions.  
• Free cash flow pre tax overall above expectations and nearly on prior -year 
quarter’s level . The development benefited from a dvance payments from 
customers which sharply exceeded the already high basis of comparison 
of prior -year quarte r.

 • Significant decrease of order s due to a  large project in the first quarter of 
the prior year creating a high basis for comparison , particularly in the Com-
pression business . 
• Book -to-bill ratio was 1.21. Order backlog came in at €6. 1bn below past 
fiscal year -end (€6.4bn) due to negative c urrency translation  effects.  
• Revenue grew in all four independen t business es. 
• Profit  before Special items and corresponding margin continued the posi-
tive trend from prior fiscal year contributing to the  ongoing  turn around. 
This was  based on progress across the businesses due to  higher revenue , 
improved business mix with a higher service share  and operational im-
provements.

 • Orders substantially decreased year -over -year mainly due to lower volume 
in Northern  Europe.

(September 30, 2022: €35.1bn) including negative currency translation ef-
fects . 
• Revenue growth was driven by a significant increase in the wind turbines 
business . 
• Profit before Special items was burdened by charges of €472m  which  were 
triggered by a detecte d negative development of failure rates in specific 
components resulting in higher warranty and service maintenance costs , 
impacting mainly the service business. Excluding th ese negative  charge s, 
result of SGRE continued to reflect the impact of inflationa ry pressures and 
supply chain challenges as well as effects from executing legacy onerous 
projects.  
• Increased negative impact from special items was due to higher restruc-
turing costs year -over -year mainly in connection with the  “Mistral” pro-
gram.

 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements includes items which 
management does not consider to be indicative of the segments’ perfor -
mance – mainly group management costs (management and corporate func-
tions) and other central items, Treasury acti vities as well as eliminations. 
Other central items include Siemens brand fees, corporate services  (e.g. man-
agement of the Group’s real estate portfolio (except SGRE ’s), which was allo-
cated to the Gas and Power segment  in the prior year) , corporate project s, 
centrally held equity interests and other items.  
The negative change year -over -year in Reconciliation to Consolidated Finan-
cial Statements was mainly due to increased costs for corporate functions . 
 Earnings Release Q1  FY 20 23 | Siemens Energy  
6 Outlook  
Assumptions for the segments GS, GT and TI in respect to revenue growth and Profit margins before Special items remain unchanged  and we  continue to 
expect for Siemens Energy comparable revenue growth (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) in  fiscal year 2023 in a range of 3% to 7% (un-
changed) . 
Due to the aforementioned charges  on the result, SGRE’s management no longer expects SGRE’s profitability to be in line with its business plan for fiscal year 
2023. Accordingly, we had to adjust our out look for Siemens Energy for fiscal year 2023 . 
We now expect Siemens Energy Group’s Profit margin before Special items between 1% and 3% (previously in a range of 2% to 4%) and, accordingly, Net loss 
of Siemens Energy Group to be on prior fiscal year’s repo rted level  (previously a sharp reduction of Net loss compared to fiscal year 2022 ). 
Due to the better than expected  cash flow development during the  quarter, we now expect Free cash flow pre tax for fiscal year 2023 to be positive  (previously 
in a negative  range of  low- to mid -triple -digit million ). 
The outlook for Siemens Energy assumes no major negative financial impacts from COVID -19 or other pandemic related events, no further deterioration in the  
supply chain and raw material cost environment, and excludes charges related to legal and regulatory matters.

regulator 
The Siemens Energy Padmount Voltage Regulator offers a 
new dimension to underground system planning and design 
that preserves an aesthetically pleasing environment. 
Maintaining all of the functionality of a traditional regulator, 
the Padmount Voltage Regulator improves safety because there are no exposed high-voltage lines. Additionally, the tamper-resistant, secured cabinet design protects the access 
to components including the drain valve, bushings and cover 
bolts.
The layout and positioning of the controls is on the narrow 
end of the box, which allows for additional placement options 
and smaller operational space requirements. The controls are 
ergonomically positioned for easy access for operators. The 
bushing connections and sample valve reside in the lower 
enclosure.

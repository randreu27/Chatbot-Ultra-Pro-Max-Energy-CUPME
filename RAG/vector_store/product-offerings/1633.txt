Press release  by Siemens Energy and Mitsubishi Electric  
Siemens Energy and Mitsubishi Electric sign 
MoU to move faster to develop gas solutions 
with zero global -warming potential in  the 
high -voltage power transmission industry  
On June 5 (World Environment Day*), Siemens Energy and Mitsubishi Electric signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to conduct a feasibility study on the joint development of 
high -voltage switching solutions  with zero global -warming potential (GWP) that substitute 
greenhouse gases with clean air for insulation. Both companies will research methods for scaling up 
the application of clean -air insulation technology to higher voltages. They’ll start with a 245 -kV 
dead -tank circuit breaker that will speed up the availability of climate -neutral high -voltage 
switching solutions for customers around the globe. Both partners will continue to manufacture, 
sell, and service switchgear solutions independently.  
 
In most of  the world's substations, sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) – the most potent greenhouse gas in 
the world, with a potential for global warming roughly 23,500 times greater than CO 2, – is still the 
insulating gas of choice. Even with a very low number of leakages, the impact on global warming is 
significant. In light of the drive toward global decarbonization, the demand for alternatives is 
growing as operators seek future -proof technologies that significantly reduce the carbon footprint 
of their systems. At the sam e time, regulations to reduce or prohibit the use of fluorinated gases in 
the electrical industry are being reviewed and implemented in various parts of the world.  
 
Siemens Energy and Mitsubishi Electric are pioneers in the development of high -voltage swit ching 
solutions. Both companies have been working on the development of SF 6-free gas -insulated Joint p ress release

switching solutions that replace the greenhouse gas with clean air, a pure mixture of nitrogen and 
oxygen, in order to contribute to global carbon -neutrality goa ls. To date, clean -air insulation is the 
only alternative to greenhouse gases and therefore poses zero health and safety risks. In 
conjunction with vacuum interrupters, a higher performance for switching applications is ensured, 
even compared with all know n SF 6 circuit breakers.  
 
Siemens Energy’s Blue Portfolio offers future -proof and environmentally friendly solutions for high -
voltage power transmission. It comprises F -gas-free gas -insulated switchgear, circuit breakers, and 
instrument transformers. The c ombination of vacuum -switching technology and clean -air insulation 
enables a significant reduction of emissions  without any impact on  the lifetime of the products. 
While circuit breakers that use clean -air and vacuum -switching technology have been availabl e for 
at least 15 years for voltage levels up to 72.5 kV, the outstanding technical performance and low 
lifecycle costs also make it a perfect choice for other substation products, including gas -insulated 
switchgear up to 145 kV, with absolutely zero CO 2 equivalent emissions over the lifetime of the 
equipment. Siemens Energy’s Blue products lie outside the scope of any conceivable F -gas 
regulation.  
 
Mitsubishi Electric provides a variety of high - and medium -voltage products to ensure the safe and 
reliable operation of modern power networks. With its state -of-the-art, best in the industry vacuum -
interruption and dry -air insulation technology, Mitsubishi Electric is contributing to society by 
providing (SF 6-free) and zero CO 2 equivalent emission, ene rgy-efficient, and low lifecycle -cost 
solutions. Mitsubishi Electric has manufactured high -quality vacuum tubes and products since 1965 
and started providing its 72.5 -kV vacuum interrupter in 2002. The company is extending its vast 
experience with vacuum a nd dry -air technology to create a new lineup of higher -voltage circuit 
breaker and switchgear products.

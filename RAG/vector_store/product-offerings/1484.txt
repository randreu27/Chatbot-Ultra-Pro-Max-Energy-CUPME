8 Full-scale LCAs adopt a comprehensive approach, covering the environmental impacts over the entire life cycle.
9 Screening LCAs cover environmentally relevant parts or phases of a product life cycle.
10  Share of full-scale LCAs is calculated based on the business segment structure. One business segment is considered to be one portfolio element. All portfolio elements containing material products have been determined to be “relevant” for this performance indicator. If full-scale LCAs are available for products of a portfolio element, this portfolio element 
is considered to be “covered”. The share represents the percentage of covered portfolio elements relative to the total number of relevant portfolio elements.
11 Without SGRE. 80% of employees covered at SGRE.

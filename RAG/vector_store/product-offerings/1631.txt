demand for F -gas-free 
high -voltage switchgear
There is an increasingly urgent need to achieve decarbonization in all 
sectors worldwide –actions to reduce GHG emissions must be taken fast
•In the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change) Paris Agreement signed by 189 countries in 
2015, it was agreed to limit anthropogenic global warming to 
well under 2º centigrade
•Each country must determine and report regularly on how it 
intends to mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions and thus 
reduce global warming
•Up to now more than 100 countries have submitted a net -
zero document ( Net-Zero Tracker )
US
2035: 100% clean electricity
2050: Net zero GHG pollution
EU
2050: First climate -neutral continent
China
> 2030: CO2 emission peak
> 2060: Carbon neutrality
The pressure on power companies to phase out 
SF6and other F -gases is especially high
•With global carbon emissions hitting an all -time high of 
47.5 Gt in 2020*, there is growing pressure on power 
companies to step up their decarbonization efforts
•SF6is classified as a strong greenhouse gas (GHG) with 
a CO2 equivalent of 24,300, but is still commonly used as 
an isolation gas in switchgear products
•An increasing number of companies have already 
committed to switching to SF6 -free alternatives
*      Climatewatchdata.org

SF6gas has a GWP 24,300 times higher than CO2–and the 
GWP of other F -gas alternatives is also way above zero
SF6installations
10,000 tons of SF6are installed
annually, with leakage1of 50 tons and 
a GWP of around 24,3002It takes 1,000 years 
fornature to absorb SF6
19,440,000,000 trees
are needed to absorb the impact
of the yearly installations and 89,424,000
to absorb the yearly leakage of SF6

This is the most environmentally
friendly switching technology 
in the world with a GWP of 0The leakage rate of 
clean air is 0.1% and it

No greenhouse gases
No impact on health or environment
At the moment, natural -origin gases likeclean air aretheonly way to achieve Zero.What is global warming
potential (GWP)?
It represents the heat 
absorption effect of any GHG 
relative to CO2, which has a 
GWP of 1
•SF6is already restricted and complete phase -out is more than probable
•F-gases are under investigation and restriction as well as a ban is possible
•Clean air does not need any regulation now or in the future
1 Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances
2 The European Commission bans using PFAS and F -gases with a GWP >10 in switchgear (October 2023)
3European Chemicals Agency reportHealth and safety risks of F -gases Cost risks of SF6/ F-gas regulations
•SF6and fluoronitrile F-gas mixes produce toxic 
decomposition products during electric arcs and operation
•F-gases belong to the PFAS1group:
more than 4,700 chemicals which accumulate in both 
humans and the environment, and which are highly 
persistent and toxic (negative health impact; 
contamination of water and soil).Phasing out SF6and other F -gas mixes is inevitable –clean air is the 
only future -proof option
•F-gas regulation (EU)2
•SF6ban California (CARB) / New York in discussion
•PFAS ban Maine (DEP) and Minnesota
•ECHA report3from 02.2023 includes a restriction proposal for 
PFAS -F-gases in switchgears starting 2026/27 
•Worldwide institutions are following, e.g. Stockholm 
Convention (UN) or the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) 
having established a PFAS Council in the US

high -voltage portfolio
Unrestricted © Siemens Energy, 2024Achieving Zero emissions 
andZero harm
in energy transmission
all over the worldOurBlue switchgear portfolio already offers asolution,
with agreater mission inmind:
Until now, switchgear technology has typically used F -gases...
In particular, 
SF6gas. 
But whenever 
technically possible, 
we must stop using 
these gases.Because SF6is 24,300 
times more climate -hostile 
than CO2, and stays in the 
atmosphere for over 1,000 
years.
To compensate forthe 
annual global installations of 
SF6would take more than 
19 billion trees.The only way to achieve 
carbon neutrality and 
Zero toxicity is by using 
clean air.That’s not 
sustainable. And 
other F -gases 
neither.
That's why 
ourBlue 
portfolio uses 
clean air and 
vacuum switching 
technology.Zero harmful gases.
And Zero contribution 
to climate change.

 Earnings Release  Q1 FY 202 5 
October  1 to December  31, 2024 
Munich, Germany , February  12, 202 5 – Siemens Energy  today announced  its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 202 5 that ended Decem-
ber 31, 202 4. 
Strong start to the year – capitalizing on favorable market trends  
“Our strong first quarter reflects the market opportunities arising from the increasing demand for electricity . The strong cash  flow  was mainly 
driven by growth across all our businesses, advance payments and timing effects . Our focus lies still on profitable  topline growth  and technological 
leadership ”, says Christian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy AG.  
• Siemens Energy got off to a strong  start to this new fiscal year.  Demand for our products remained favorable and the strong order trend s 
continued . The prior -year quarter ’s figures for revenue, Profit  before Special items and cash flow  were clearly exceeded . All segments contributed 
to the improvement s. 
• Orders of Siemens Energy amounted to €13. 7bn. As expected, this was below the high  level of the prior -year quarter, in which Grid Technologies 
and Transformation of Industry had booked  exceptionally high order s. Book-to-bill ratio (ratio of order s to revenue) was 1.53 , leading to a  record  
order backlog of €131bn. 
• Revenue of  €8.9 bn increased by 18. 4% on a comparable basis (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects)  with a ll segments record ing 
growth . 
• Profit before Special items of Siemens Energy more than doubled year -over-year to €48 1m (Q1  FY 2024: €208m) again  held back by results of 
Siemens Gamesa, but to a significantly  lesser extent than in the prior -year quarter. Special items amounted to negative  €18m (Q1  FY 2024: 
positive  €1,670m, in connection with disposals). Siemens Energy's Profit  came in at  €463m (Q1  FY 2024: €1,878m).  
• Net income was €252m (Q1  FY 2024: €1,582m). Corresponding basic earnings per share were  €0.23  (Q1 FY 2024: €1.79).  
• Free cash flow  pre tax  was materially  stronger than expected at  positive  €1,528m (Q1  FY 2024: negative  €283 m) driven by  project advance 
payments and timing effects  of customer payments. All segmen ts contributed to the improvement.  
• Based on  the development in the first quarter, management now expects that Siemens Energy will exceed the current Free cash flow pre tax 
guidance of up to €1bn and therefore intends to update the  Free cash flow pre tax outlook  for fiscal year 2025 with the half -year results for 
fiscal year 2025 .

(11.1)%  on a nominal basis, revenue respectively by  16.9% . 
 • Despite considerable  increases at Gas Services and Siemens Gamesa , 
orders declined year -over-year due to the exceptionally high prior -
year level at Grid Technologies and Transformation of Industry. The 
share of the s ervice business increased sharply  compared with the 
prior -year quarter. Nevertheless, the clear majority of order s were 
attributable to the new units business.  
• Book-to-bill ratio was strong at 1.53. Order backlog once again ex-
ceeded the previous record level and rose to €131bn. 
• Revenue increased due to significant  growth in both the new units  
and service business.  
• Profit  before Special items and the corresponding margin rose 
sharply . All segments showed  profit improvements. This was driven 
by increased volume, processing  higher margin order backlog and 
the strong operati onal  performance thereby . In addition, the busi-
ness mix  was more  favorable than a year ago . 
• In the prior year, Special items included the pre -tax gain from the 
sale of an 18 percent s hare  in the centrally held stake in Siemens 
Limited, India.  
• Development of Free cash flow pre tax was due to  sharp  improve-
ments  in all segments. This was driven by customer advance pay-
ments and timing effects, including accelerated payments from  cus-
tomer side.

 • Substantial  year -over-year increase  in order s was mainly due to large  
orders in the service business. Growth was driven by  demand in the 
Americas and the Middle East . 
• Book-to-bill ratio was 1.77. The order backlog increased to  €49bn. 
• Revenue clearly  exceeded prior -year’s level  due to  significant  growth 
in the service business.  
• Profit  before Special items and the corresponding margin rose s ub-
stantially  compared to the prior -year  quarter. This was driven by 
higher volume in the service business and improved operati onal  per-
formance. Profit development benefited also from positive one-off 
effects , mainly  currency related .

high -voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system s in Ger-
many.  
• Grid Technologies recorded a Book-to-bill ratio of 2.06 and the order 
backlog rose to € 36bn. 
• Revenue increased substantially  across all businesses, led by growth 
in the solution business.  
• Sharp  year -over-year rise of Profit  before Special items and the 
higher  corresponding margin were due to increased volume, opera-
tional improvements and the higher margin of the processed order 
backlog.  
• Negative Special items  of the prior -year quarter were mainly related 
to the sale of  the Trench business.

orders  – particular ly due to two orders in the Compression and In-
dustrial Steam Turbines & Generators businesses  – in the prior -year 
quarter . 
• Book-to-bill ratio was 1.09.  Order backlog at the end of the quarter 
amounted to € 8bn. 
• Revenue  increased in all businesses , in particular driven by execution  
of the high order backlog in the Compression business . 
• Profit  before Special items and the corresponding margin increased 
sharply  compared to the prior -year quarter. Th is was driven by the 
increased volume  and resulting degression effects , a strong opera-
tional performance as well as  the comparatively higher margin of the 
processed order backlog.

55.6%  on a nominal basis, revenue respectively by  18.4% . 
 • Order s increased sharply  compared to prior -year quarter, as growth  
in the o ffshore business exceeded the decline in  the onshore busi-
ness  by far . Offshore growth was primarily d ue to  a large  order 
booked in the North Sea for €1.4b n. Onshore orders were affected  
by the follow -on effects  or continuation of the temporary interrup-
tion of sales activities for the 4.X and 5.X turbines . 
• Book-to-bill ratio came in at  1.01. Order backlog at quarter -end 
amounted to € 39bn. 
• Revenue increased s ignificant ly, with a decrease  in the onshore busi-
ness more than offset by growth in the offshore business.  
• Profit  before Special items remained negative but  improved signifi-
cantly  compared to prior -year quarter. This was primarily driven by 
continued offshore growth . Nevertheless, profit  continued to be 
held back by follow -on effects  of cost increases related  to the ramp -
up of offshore activities as well as  the quality issues  in the onshore 
area . 
• Increase d negative Special items resulted from expenses in connec-
tion with the restructuring of the wind business.

6 Outlook  
For fiscal year 2025, we continue to anticipate overall favorable conditions in Siemens Energy ’s relevant market  environment. Strong electricity 
consumption growth,  replacement investment and the requirements of the energy transition necessitate  investment in energy infrastruc ture sup-
porting all businesses of Siemens Energy . At Siemens Gamesa we continue to work on the measures to reach break -even in fiscal year 2026. We 
continue to strive for resume sales activities for the 5.X onshore turbine during fiscal year 2025.  
We expect  for Siemens Energy  to achieve comparable revenue growth (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) in fiscal year 2025 in 
a range of 8 % to 1 0 % and a  Profit margin before Special items between 3 % and 5 %. We expect Net income to be around break -even ex cluding 
assumed positive Special items subsequent to the demerger of the energy business from Siemens Limited, India. Due to the development in the 
first quarter, we now expect to exceed the previous  Free cash flow pre tax guidance of u p to €1bn . We  intend to update the  Free cash flow pre tax 
outlook with the half -year results for fiscal year 2025.  
The outlook for Siemens Energy does not include charges related to legal and regulatory matters.  
Overall assumptions per business area  
• Gas Services  assumes  a comparable  revenue  growth  of 7 % to 9 % and a Profit  margin  before  Special  items  of 10 % to 12 %. 
• Grid Technologies  plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of 23 % to 25 % and a Profit margin before Special items between  10 % and 
12 %. 
• Transformation of Industry  expect s a comparable  revenue  growth  of 11 % to 13 % and a Profit  margin  before  Special  items  of 8 % to 10 %. 
• Siemens Gamesa  assumes a comparable revenue growth of negative 9 % to negative 5 % and a negative Profit before Special items of around  
€1.3bn.

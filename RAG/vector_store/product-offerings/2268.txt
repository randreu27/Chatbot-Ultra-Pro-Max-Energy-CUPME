Versatility and Performance
The PHE is a horizontally opposed, two-
throw, reciprocating compressor designed 
for long-term, process gas service. Designed 
to API-618 specifications. It can handle a 
variety of drivers with either direct or  
V-belt connections and can be fitted  
with either lubricated or non-lubricated 
cylinders ranging from 1.625 to 19 inches  
(41 to 483 mm) in bore diameter.Like all Dresser-Rand business reciprocating 
process compressors, the PHE is engineered 
to our high standards, ensuring long-lasting 
reliability. It offers a versatile alternative to 
larger, more costly compressors, providing 
an economic solution for requirements that 
demand full-time performance in lower 
volume service.The Dresser-Rand PHE 
reciprocating process 
compressor provides an 
economical solution where 
full-time, medium volume 
service is a requirement. Its 
proven performance, balanced 
design, and wide range of 
cylinder selections make the 
PHE an excellent choice for a 
variety of applications.

Designed and Built With Precision
With its fine-grain, cast iron frame, the  
PHE is engineered to provide maximum 
support for the running gear and related 
components. The rigid frame design and 
balanced crankshaft minimize vibration  
and provide for low moments and 
minimal foundation requirements. 
Forged from high tensile strength alloy 
steel, the crankshaft is fully stress 
relieved and heat-treated. The bearing 
journals and crankpin are precision 
ground and polished to exacting 
tolerances.
Rugged, precision-machined aluminum 
main and crankpin bearings are 
generously sized for best run-in and 
long-lasting service. All bearings are 
force-lubricated per API-618 
specifications. Connecting rods are 
die-forged steel with rifle-drilled 
passages for positive lubrication of the 
crosshead  
pin and bushing. A shoe-less aluminum 
crosshead is standard and requires no 
adjustment.ROD

Maximum integration for the highest connectivity standards
As we’ve learned from decades of designing distributed control systems  
for power generation, the foundation for efficient control of the entire plant 
is openness to variable communication standards along with secure 
communication in internal and external networks.
Whether it’s access to third-party systems using a specifically qualified 
terminal server or the integration of internal and external systems – 
Omnivise T3000 is designed for the highest demands for communication 
security and openness. 
It supports common standards in industry communication as well  
as future-oriented IEC standards. Traditional control systems based  
on proprietary protocols can be connected to the HMI, and individual  
applications can be accessed via HTML5 or RDP within the operator’s  
work environment. Omnivise T3000 opens up a world of communication 
opportunities. End-to-end data flows and central operability make your 
plant easier and more efficient to operate.Integration into management IT
Good decisions are based on real data.  
From operational and performance data  
to defined KPIs and status information  
on components: Omnivise T3000 provides  
you with whatever you need from the current 
and ongoing process.
Open communication
Omnivise T3000 supports common industry 
standards as well as IEC and OPC standards.  
It can even connect traditional control systems 
that are based on proprietary protocols to the 
automation level or the HMI. Users can access 
further applications from the Omnivise T3000 
Workbench via HTML5 or RDP. 
Access and data distribution
Using role definitions, a comprehensive 
 authorization concept provides each user  
with exactly the information and data they 
need at any given time. For full control and 
fast, well-founded decisions in plant operation, 
on-site or even from a central control room. 
Process interfaces
When it comes to communication to the field, 
Omnivise T3000 fulfills every requirement. 
From HART, PROFIBUS, and PROFINET to tradi-
tional I/Os and smart field devices, and from 
OPC UA to IEC – the process interface can be 
scaled to any plant configuration.Openness as a concept

One system to rule them all
With Omnivise T3000, we use a single system for engineering, diagnostics, 
and automation. Your advantages are obvious: In addition to not needing 
extra hardware or even separate systems, you also have fewer interfaces, 
which is beneficial in many ways. First of all, your effort to keep data 
 consistent is reduced, as is the risk of intrusion. Secondly, the system makes  
it especially easy for you to implement engineering changes and new tasks.
In addition, Omnivise T3000 is based on a client/server architecture that  
helps reduce investment costs by replacing individual operator terminals  
and systems with inexpensive Thin Clients consisting of a monitor, a network 
connection, a keyboard, and a mouse.
Clearly defined levels and security zones
Omnivise T3000 and its client/server architecture offer another advantage:  
All the levels are separated from each another with protocol changes between 
the field, automation, application, and operation and monitoring levels.  
This not only supports communication security, it’s also a robust foundation 
for the system’s security zone architecture. Communication within the system 
is in complete conformity with common industry standards.Your benefits

One for all
A single intuitive user interface for every task and all users in every operating 
scenario – that’s what distinguishes Omnivise T3000, thanks to its continuous 
development throughout the various SPPA-T3000 releases. And it runs without 
proprietary software on a standard browser. So every employee sees what 
they need to know, when and where they need the information: from the 
status of the entire plant (monitoring) to automation and other operating 
activities (control).Intuitive user interface
Windows-style drop-down menus, pop-up windows, 
 multi-windows, simple search functions, point  
information, and many other features make the 
work of operators and engineers easy and intuitive, 
even with  simultaneous workflows on a single 
object level. 
The toolbox your plant needs
Omnivise T3000 was designed for power generation 
– with unique electronics technology, control algo-
rithms, function libraries, and concepts derived  
from our in-depth plant expertise that rely on time-
proven standards. Over the longer term, you can  
keep building on this powerful foundation, because 
we continue the development process to support  
you whenever and wherever you need it.Back to 02 Trusted highlights

One for all
Effective support in the event of an alarm
When daily routines are interrupted by unavoidable incidents, you need  
your operators to take fast and intelligent action. Omnivise T3000 helps  
them get the unit back to normal again by providing the right cues and   
built-in decision support: 
 Enclosed: Alarms and warnings are accompanied by detailed information 
and guidance for rapid resolution. 
 Comprehensive help: In the event of an alarm, the operator is guided 
through root cause analyses, gets one-click access to relevant data like 
 automatic first-value searching, and is offered precise handling instructions 
so they can react quickly. 
 Message flood under control: The inventive alarm handling simplifies  
operation in the event of a fault: for example, by re-directing or archiving 
unimportant messages and suppressing subsequent messages.Intuitive user interface
Easy use and efficient training
All control and fail-safe functions are observable  
on a unique, single-user interface on all connected 
terminals and are available at a glance for all tasks 
– with quick and easy navigation between all views 
in the same window. Of course, the basic layout  
can be easily modified to meet your specific needs 
in terms of prioritization, individual workflows,  
and ergonomics.Back to 02 Trusted highlights

 Hardware-independent software architectureHardware and software architecture optimized  
for power-plant process standards
Omnivise T3000 is designed for the current and future requirements of power 
and heat generation processes and SCADA installations of all sizes. The system 
was developed based on our in-depth plant expertise and time-proven stan-
dards for creating the hardware, special control algorithms and concepts, 
unique closed- and open-loop controls, and a huge, comprehensive function 
library.
If there’s one constant in our customers’ business fields, it’s rapid change. 
Companies need to continuously adapt to new conditions in their markets – 
and modify their processes accordingly. This has a direct impact on the control 
system, and Omnivise T3000 is fully prepared thanks to its object-oriented  
approach.
Embedded Component Services™ (ECS)
Traditional control systems use a variety of different subsystems, each of which  
is designed for a specific task. The concept of Embedded Component Services 
in Omnivise T3000 eliminates subsystems. It’s object-oriented and makes 
keeping data consistent simple. All information on individual process  
components is integrated into a data object – from engineering, operation, 
and diagnostics to alarming and archiving.Back to 02 Trusted highlights

Optimized hardware and softwareEmbedded Component Services™ 
ECS: Data consistency for enhanced safety and availability
Object orientation means that it’s much easier for you to keep your  
control system up to date and to modify it to meet new requirements.  
That’s because the data from all of the components embedded in every 
object in the control system. In addition, all the data and information  
used in the system always comes from a single source. Therefore, only this one source needs to be changed 
for all the objects in the system that work with this 
information to be updated. Another advantage of 
ECS is the multi-view principle: Plant operators can 
choose a view that optimally meets the require-
ments of their role.
Built-in downtime reduction and more flexibility
Compared with a traditional DCS, where the plant 
display and function diagrams have separate data 
sources, Omnivise T3000 stores all the relevant  
data in its integrated objects. With its implicit  
data synchronization, Omnivise T3000 eliminates 
the explicit data synchronization between the 
 engineering steps that’s found in a traditional DCS, 
which reduces downtime when you make changes 
to the system.Back to 02 Trusted highlights

They’re based on the 1-out-of-2 principle and are capable of a bumpless  
switch to the backup system in the event of a fault.Back to 02 Trusted highlights

Your reliable choice for BoP: Automation system series3600Continuously innovated hardware components 
Benefit from the full range of basic  
IO functions in the series3600 IO system:
 Digital inputs and outputs
 SOE with 1ms resolution
 Pulse input
 Analog inputs and outputs
 Thermocouple input
 RTD input
 Analog inputs and outputs support HARTseries3600 IO system 
The modular system supports hot-swapping of individual modules and 
 redundantly acquires the analog and binary process variables from transmit-
ters at your field level via a process interface with the series3600 Automation 
Server. Operation or automation commands are also transmitted to the field 
level via this interface. For higher availability and minimized influence of the 
field on the modules, each IO module is supplied with power redundantly  
and separately from the field level.Back to 02 Trusted highlights

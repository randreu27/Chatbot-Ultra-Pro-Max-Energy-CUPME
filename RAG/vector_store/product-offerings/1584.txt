Q3 FY2023
Siemens Energy Investor Relations
Dear  shareholders,  
Because  of adverse  findings  about  product  quality  problems  of 
certain  onshore  platforms,  increased  product  cost inflation  as well as 
ramp -up challenges  in the offshore  business  we had to publish  an 
ad-hoc announcement  towards  the end of the last quarter . At our 
Q3 quarterly  results  presentation  on August  7, our CEO,  Christian  
Bruch,  our CFO,  Maria  Ferraro,  and Siemens  Gamesa  CEO  Jochen  
Eickholt,  provided  an update  about  the situation  of the wind  
business  and an updated  full year outlook  for Siemens  Gamesa  and 
Siemens  Energy . 
“Our third-quarter  results  demonstrate  the challenges  in turning  
around  Siemens  Gamesa . The strong  performance  of our other  
business  areas  gives  me confidence  in our company’s  ability  to put 
businesses  back  on a strong  footing”,  said Christian  Bruch .
During  the quarter,  the former  Gas and Power  businesses,  Gas 
Services  (GS),  Grid Technologies  (GT) and Transformation  of 
Industry  (TI), which  account  for 2/3 of group  revenue,  continued  to 
improve  on their  key performance  indicators  such  as orders,  
revenue  and profit  before  Special  Items  and showed  very 
healthy  cash  flow. However,  because  of charges  and negative  
impacts  on the underlying  performance  at Siemens  Gamesa   related  
to the above -mentioned  issues,  Siemens  Energy  as a whole  
reported  a significant  loss.
Our orders  show  that Siemens  Energy  continues  to benefit  from a 
favorable  market  environment . Orders  of €14.9bn reflect  54.2% 
growth  on a comparable  basis  (excluding  currency  translation  and 
portfolio  effects),  primarily  driven  by large  orders  at Siemens  
Gamesa  and GT. The Book -to-bill ratio (ratio  of orders  to revenue)  
came  in at 1.98 for the order  backlog  to rise to a new record  of 
€109.0bn. Revenue  increased  by 8.0% on a comparable  basis  to 
€7.5bn. Profit  before  Special  items  of Siemens  Energy  was 
negative  with €2,048m (Q3 FY 2022 : negative  €222m) driven  by 
charges  at Siemens  Gamesa  totaling  €2.2bn. 
In light of the developments  at Siemens  Gamesa,  management  
adjusts  the outlook  for Siemens  Energy .Due to the aforementioned  challenges  at Siemens  Gamesa,  
management  now expects  for Siemens  Energy  Group  comparable  
revenue  growth  to be in a range  of 9% to 11%, a Profit  margin  
before  Special  items  between  negative  10% and negative  8% and a 
Net loss of around  €4.5bn. Free cash  flow pre tax now is expected  
up to a negative  low triple -digit million  € amount . Management  
maintains  its revenue  and Profit  margin  assumptions  for the 
segments  GS, GT, and TI.
On the following  pages  we want  to give you further  insights  into the 
challenges  at Siemens  Gamesa . An in-depths  analysis  is helping  us 
to define  the right measures  to get Siemens  Gamesa  back  on track . 
We are working  hard to rectify  the situation  at Siemens  Gamesa  and  
intend  to update  on the Siemens  Gamesa  situation  and to provide  a 
mid-term outlook  for all of our businesses  during  our Capital  Market  
Day, which  will be webcast  out of Hamburg  on November  21.
Thank youforyour interest inSiemens Energy .Iwish youarelaxing
restofthesummer . 
Allthebest.

Siemens Energy Shareholder Letter Q3 FY2023 3Siemens Energy w/o Siemens Gamesa: Successful turnaround!
Ourformer Gas andPower businesses account  for 2/3 of our revenue . The current  performance  is a 
great  example  for a successful  turnaround  story . During  the third quarter  the pattern  of the first half of 
the fiscal  year continued : 
(1)Strong  order  growth  reflecting  strong  demand  
(2)Strong  revenue  growth  as we execute  on our backlog
(3)Strong  margin  improvement,  due to selectivity  2-3 years  ago, cost out and lower  NCC
(4)A strong  cash  flow,  because  of the high  level  of orders . 
During  the first nine months  of the year,  the former  Gas and Power  businesses  had an excellent  
performance . Most  impressive  is the fact, that these  businesses  generated  €1.4 billion  in Profit  
before  SI with a cash  conversion  of more  than 1 so far this year.
>€27 billion  in orders,  22% revenue  growth  and 8.7% profit  margin  in fiscal  year 2023  so far
We are capitalizing  on the quality  of our products,  our global  reach  and the opportunities  created  by 
the energy  transition . Therefore,  we booked  orders  of €27.3 billion,  which  reflects  a run rate of €9.1 
billion  per quarter,  nearly  doubling  the quarterly  run rate compared  to 2020 .
During  the first nine months,  we have  grown  revenue  in the former  Gas and Power  business  by 
22 percent  on a comparable  basis  to €16.1 billion . 
€1.4 billion  in profit  before  Special  Items,  reflects  a margin  of 8.7%. This marks  an improvement  of 
more  than  7 percentage  points  compared  to where  we started  in 2020 .
On track  to achieve  fiscal  year and mid-term  guidance
Gas Services,  Grid Technologies  and Transformation  of Industry  are on track  to reach  the 
assumptions  we have  laid out at the beginning  of the year as well as the mid-term targets  set at the 
Capital  Market  Day in May 2022 . 
Our focus  on selective  bidding,  cost out and operational  excellence  gives  us confidence  that these  
businesses  will continue  to develop  even  more  favorably  given  the positive  market  development .

Siemens Energy Shareholder Letter Q3 FY2023 4Siemens Gamesa onshore business
Background of current challenges
Siemens Gamesa offshore business
Background of current challenges
In addition  to the quality -related  charges,  Siemens  Gamesa  
expects  higher  product  costs  in the offshore  sector,  which  means  
that projects  already  committed  to contractually  cannot  be 
completed  profitably  if implemented  by the customer . In addition,  
there  are further  challenges  in the ramp -up of offshore  activities . 
€600 million  charge  in offshore
Both effects  lead to additional  charges  of €600 million  in the third 
quarter . The cash outflow  resulting  from these  burdens  will be 
spread  over several  years  and amount  to a low two-to-three -digit 
sum in the current  year. 
30 GW offshore  wind  to be added  yearly  to meet  targets
In order  to achieve  the ambitious  EU-wide targets  for renewable  
energies,  the rate of expansion,  especially  of offshore  wind 
turbines  must  be rapidly  increased . Every  year,  30 GW must  be 
added  to reach  the targets  set by 2030 .
Siemens  Gamesa  is currently  in the process  of ramping  up 
various  factories  for offshore  production  or converting  them  to 
larger  turbines,  including  in France,  Germany,  Denmark  and the 
United  Kingdom . The continuing  tight procurement  market  and the 
strained  labor  market  are contributing  to these  burdens . Siemens  Energy  has concluded  a status  report  analyzing  quality  
problems  at the onshore  platforms  4.X and 5.X of its wind power  
subsidiary  Siemens  Gamesa  following  the ad hoc release  on June  
22. 
Only  limited  number  of onshore  turbines  affected
The largest  proportion  of the quality  problems  that can occur  after a 
given  turbine  runtime  are certain  rotor blades  and main  bearings  in 
the 4.X and 5.X platforms . However,  these  are not installed  in all 
turbines  on the 4.X and 5.X platforms,  so only a limited  number  of 
the onshore  turbines  are affected . The turbines  can still be 
operated,  but to ensure  a long-term runtime,  the aim is to rectify  the 
problems  within  the normal  service  intervals . 
Task  force  established
A task force  consisting  of experts  from Siemens  Gamesa  and 
Siemens  Energy  has been  established  to deal with the identified  
problems  on the 4.X and 5.X platforms . The team  of experts  is 
supported  by AlixPartners,  a consulting  company  specializing  in the 
effective  handling  of complex  projects .
€1.6 billion  charges  for future  expenses
The expected  costs  for remedying  the quality  problems  have  been  
considered  in the third quarter,  with charges  for future  expenses  
amounting  to €1.6 billion . The immediate  liquidity  outflow  in fiscal  
2023  is low. The main  part of the expected  repair  costs  is expected  
in fiscal  2024  and 2025 . Wind turbine fleet1

Write -down of €700 million deferred tax assets
The net result  will be additionally  burdened  by the write -down  of deferred  tax assets  of approximately  €700 
million . Despite  these  additional  charges,  Siemens  Energy  still has a strong  balance  sheet  with cash and cash  
equivalents  of around  €4.4 billion .
S&P confirmed  investment  grade  rating  with a stable  outlook
The rating  agency  S&P Ratings  confirmed  its investment  grade  rating  for Siemens  Energy  at the end of June . In 
contrast  to the challenges  in the wind business,  Siemen  Energy's  conventional  energy  business  achieved  
excellent  results  in the third quarter .
Siemens Gamesa: Measures defined and under implementation
Slower growth and longer path to target profitability
Clear  measures  have  been  taken  to cope  with the current  challenges
The Supervisory  Board  of Siemens  Energy  has set up a special  committee  for a detailed  investigation  of the 
quality  and productivity  problems  at Siemens  Gamesa . 
Independent  external  experts  have  critically  reviewed  and positively  assessed  the methodology  used  to 
calculate  theoretical  future  failure  rates  as well as expected  follow -up costs . 
A cross -functional  task force,  consisting  of experts  from Siemens  Gamesa,  Siemens  Energy  and Alix Partners,  
has been  tasked  with resolving  the quality  issues  for the 4.X and 5.X. 
In addition,  certain  third-party  suppliers  were  excluded  from further  deliveries . 
Strategic  update  at the Capital  Market  Day on November  21, 2023
Due to the developments  at Siemens  Gamesa,  Siemens  Energy  is reviewing  the current  strategy  and action  
plan in the wind business . Details  of this strategic  plan will be presented  at the Capital  Markets  Day in 
November . 
Outlook for the fiscal year 2023
In light of the developments  at Siemens  Gamesa,  we 
amended  the outlook  for the fiscal  year 2023  for 
Siemens  Energy . 
Overall  assumptions  for the segments  GS, GT, and TI 
for fiscal  year 2023  remain  unchanged .
Siemens  Gamesa  adjusts  revenue  and Profit  
assumptions  for fiscal  year 2023  and now assumes  
comparable  revenue  growth  of negative  3% to 0% 
(previously  positive  6% to positive  10%) and a 
negative  Profit  before  Special  items  around  €4.3 
billion . 
In addition  to the aforementioned  charges,  the 
assumptions  for Siemens  Gamesa  reflect  lower  profit  
contributions  from the execution  of its current  order  
backlog  mainly  related  to increased  product  costs  and 
continued  ramp -up challenges  in the offshore  activities .Accordingly,  we now expect  for Siemens  Energy  
comparable  revenue  growth  to be in a range  of 9% 
to 11% (previously  10% to 12%) and a Profit  margin  
before  Special  items  between  negative  10% and 
negative  8% (previously  around  the low end of the 
guidance  range  of positive  1% to positive  3%). 
Net loss of Siemens  Energy  Group  now is expected  
to be around  €4.5 billion  (previously  expected  to 
exceed  prior fiscal  year’s  level of €712 million  by up to 
a low-triple -digit million  € amount) . 
We now expect  a Free  cash  flow pre tax for fiscal  
year 2023  up to a negative  low triple -digit  million  € 
amount  (previously  positive  up to a low triple -digit 
million  € amount) .

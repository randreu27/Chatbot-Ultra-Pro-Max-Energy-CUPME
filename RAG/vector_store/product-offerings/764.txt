Siemens Energy Green Bond Reporting 2022/23Page 3In January 2023, Siemens Energy developed a Green Bond Framework (the 
“Framework”) along with a Second-Party Opinion from Sustainalytics, 
under which we can issue green bonds to (re)-finance, in whole or in part, 
existing and future projects that are expected to facilitate the clean energy 
transition. 
The Framework defines eligible expenditures under the ICMA green proj-
ects category “Renewable Energy” as follows:
Eligible green expenditures under the Framework include majority acquisi-
tions of companies or minority equity participations in entities that derive 
90% or more of their revenues from activities meeting the eligibility crite-
ria described in the table above, also called ‘pure player companies’, as well 
as the re-financing of existing debt of pure player companies.
On March 29, 2023, Siemens Energy Finance B.V. placed a dual-tranche 
green note with an aggregate principal amount of EUR 1,500 million under 
the Framework.Introduction

Siemens Energy Green Bond Reporting 2022/23Page 4With its inaugural Green Bond, Siemens Energy re-financed the existing 
debt of Siemens Gamesa, defined as a pure-player company under the 
Framework.
Siemens Gamesa reports over ninety-nine percent (99.28%) of its revenues 
in fiscal year 2022 as EU-Taxonomy eligible. Of this, 76.9% corresponds to 
the wind turbine manufacturing activity (3.1 Manufacture of renewable 
energy technologies), and 22.4% to the Service activity (7.6 Installation, 
maintenance, and repair of renewable energy technologies). Only 0.7% of 
total revenue, which corresponds to the sale of gearboxes and electric cab-
inets to third parties in different sectors, is reported as non-eligible, result-
ing in Siemens Gamesa to be considered as a pure player company.
• Overview of the Green Bond(s) outstanding: Siemens Energy has two 
Green Bonds outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of EUR 
1,500 million (in two tranches of EUR 750 million each).Allocation Report

Siemens Energy Green Bond Reporting 2022/23Page 5Siemens Energy’s economic interest in Siemens Gamesa was diluted by 
minority shareholders. By using the proceeds of the Green Bonds to re-fi -
nance the existing debt of Siemens Gamesa, which was a pre-condition for 
the acquisition of the remaining minority shares of Siemens Gamesa, 
Siemens Energy resolved this dilution. The owners of Siemens Energy are 
now able to immediately invest more net economic resources into Wind 
Power. 
The most substantial and tangible environmental benefits from the full 
integration of Siemens Gamesa within Siemens Energy will come over  
time through cost synergies and unified business strategy. However, the 
impact can already be measured based on the following Key Performance 
Indicators:Impact Reporting
• Installed Wind Power capacity, net to Siemens Energy (MW):  
Total capacity installed:  
136,893 MW (includes a positive impact of 45,626 MW)  
Total number of turbines:

amount of EUR 1,500 million has been on-lend to SGRE to re-finance
existing debt by repaying existing debt (Revolving Credit Facility) on 
June 21, 2023 – an amount equivalent to 100% of the proceeds of the 
EUR 1,500 million Senior Bond (Green Bond) has now been allocated to 
the mentioned transaction. Thus, 100% of the proceeds have been allo-
cated to refinancing eligible green expenditures.
• Balance of unallocated proceeds invested in cash and/or cash equiv -
alents if any:   
100% of the net proceeds have been allocated; there are therefore no 
unallocated proceeds invested in cash or cash equivalents.

Siemens Energy Green Bond Reporting 2022/23Page 6ance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information, issued by the IAASB. Those standards require that we plan 
and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about 
whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe 
that the company’s Allocation report is not prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the SE Green Bond Framework. Not subject to 
our assurance engagement are references to disclosures made outside the 
Allocation Report and Section 3 “Impact Reporting” of the “Siemens Energy 
Green Bond Reporting 2022/23”.
In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are less 
extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly, a 
substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of the 
assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the auditor.
In the course of our assurance engagement we have, among other things, 
performed the following assurance procedures and other activities:
• Inquiries of employees involved in the allocation of proceeds, the 
reporting process and the internal control system in relation to this pro-
cess, to assess the use of proceeds and the reporting process and the 
internal controls to the extent relevant for the assurance engagement 
on the disclosures in the Allocation report,
• Inspection of the relevant documentation of the systems and processes 
for classifying projects (“eligible projects”) in accordance with the SE 
Green Bond Framework and review thereof,
• Inspection of the relevant documentation of the systems and processes 
for the allocation of proceeds,directors consider necessary to enable the preparation of the Allocation 
report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
(manipulation of the Allocation report) or error.
B. Independence and quality assurance of the 
auditor’s firm 
We have complied with the German professional requirements on inde-
pendence as well as other professional conduct requirements.
Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional pro-
nouncements – in particular the BS WP/vBP [“Berufssatzung für Wirtschafts-
prüfer/vereidigte Buchprüfer”: Professional Charter for German Public 
Accountants/German Sworn Auditors] in the exercise of their Profession and 
the IDW Standard on Quality Management issued by the Institute of Public 
Auditors in Germany (IDW): Requirements for Quality Management in the 
Audit Firm (IDW QS 1) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive quality 
management system that includes documented policies and procedures 
with regard to compliance with professional ethical requirements, profes-
sional standards as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.
C. Responsibilities of the auditor 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Allocation report based 
on our assurance engagement.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the Interna-
tional Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assur -Independent auditor’s report on a limited assurance

a result, it may not be suitable for another purpose than the aforemen -
tioned. Accordingly, the report is not intended to be used by third parties 
for making (financial) decisions based on it. Our responsibility is to the 
Company alone. We do not accept any responsibility to third parties. Our

Energy AG, Munich, for the period of 5 April 2023 to 30 September 2023 is

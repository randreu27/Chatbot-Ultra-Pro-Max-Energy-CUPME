2 BASIC INFORMATION  & QUICK REFERENCE  
2.1 Product overview  
DigiTRON connectors  intended use is to provide low voltage and communications links between 
pieces of electrical equipment that are submerged in water, e.g. subsea.  
The DigiTRON range of connectors have been developed for long term reliable communications and 
low voltage power control system  applications associated with offshore installations. The underwater 
mateable capacity of these connectors is achieved using pressure compensated electrical inserts 
employing the CE principle.   
Examples of connectors are shown in section 2.7.

Unrestricted   
 Caution.  Risk of material damage.  Maximum cumulative exposure of the male pins to 
seawater is 28 days to prevent corrosion of the pins.  If the connectors are to be left 
unmated, in seawater, for any length of time Subsea Environment Cap or Dummy Plug 
must be fitted to protect the pin contacts in the receptacle connectors. Over exposure will 
increase the risk of corrosion damage or marine growth on the contact surfaces of the 
receptacle contact pins. This could lead to damage to the seals and insulation within the 
plug socket contacts. Plug connectors do not require full dummy connectors for 
protection. Siemens  Energy  Subsea advise the fitting of acetal caps to protect plugs 
against marine growth. It is good practice to always fit the protective cap when a 
connector is unmated topside prior to deployment to provide mechanical protection.  
 Caution.  Risk of material damage. Unmated receptacles (exposed male pins) should 
never be electrically energised subsea (even a small residual voltage e.g. 1 Volt).  This 
can very quickly corrode the pins, cause detrimental chemical reactions locally in the 
seawat er, and even cause complete electrical failure of the product.

6 PREPARING PRODUCT FOR USE  OR STORAGE  
6.1 Product protection and packaging  
Siemens Energy  Subsea electrical connectors are manufactured primarily from materials such as 
316L stainless steel and Super Duplex stainless steel, and as such are designed to withstand harsh 
saliferous environments. However, the connector inserts and exposed parts are  susceptible to 
mechanical damage if not protected. Transport  caps or Acetal protective caps must be fitted to all 
Siemens Energy  Subsea connectors before transport.  
 Caution.  Risk of material damage. Transport caps or protecti on caps must always be fitte d 
to an unmated connector during transport , and  should  remain in place while topside before 
deployment   
 
Products may be stored in their original packing crates or boxes indefinitely.  
Wooden packaging crates supplied with Siemens Energy products are not w eatherproof.  
As a guide, outdoor storage should be limited to around 3 months with protection from direct sun 
and rain.  Actual duration will depend on the environmental conditions, e.g. in temperate dry 
conditions more than 3 months may be acceptable, in inclement conditions or use offshore it may 
be less than 3 months. It is recommended to inspect the crates periodically during  outdoor storage 
to assess their suitability to protect the products from the external environment and to withstand 
handling.  
 
Be very careful if fitting additional screws, nails or staples to the crate, such that they do not protrude 
on the inside of the crates.  This can very easily damage the hoses within.  
Connectors can be shipped singularly or in multiples. Care should be tak en to protect the 
connector(s) with âInstapackâ, bubble wrap or similar wrapping materials to avoid surface damage 
during transit. If large numbers are shipped in one consignment suitably reinforced transport box will 
be necessary to withstand the weight. See Figure 7  and Figure 8 .

Figure 8  Unacceptable packaging and storage  
 
Bulkhead type connectors with exposed tailing wires should be packed and shipped in a suitably 
sized box to allow  adequate space for the tailing wires without bending or kinking.  
Connectors are designed to withstand vibration that occurs during transportation and to withstand 
being dropped from a height of 1 m (3.3 ft) whilst in packaging.  
If the connectors are assemb led onto hoses these must be suitably coiled and secured with tape to 
prevent uncoiling during transit. Respect the hose minimum bend radius  (125mm (4.9â) for 
AquaTRON 50, 180mm (7.1â) for AquaTRON 75) . 
 
6.2 Unpacking  
Remove wrapping material taking care to inspect for any surface damage or items that may have 
become separated from the connector, such as âO' seals. Do not use a knife to cut the wrapping 
material, as this may cause damage to any elastomeric parts of the connector. Do not remove 
protective caps  until connectors are ready for installation. On removal do not allow the hoses to drag 
over the edges of the packing crate. Connectors supplied in boxes must be stored in the box.  
6.3 Storage, protection and end of life  
Connectors are sensitive to environment s where grit and dirt are present.  All connectors come 
supplied with a transport cap.  It is recommended to leave the caps on whenever possible.  The caps 
must be removed before subsea deployment.  
Connector may be fitted with a back plastic Protective Cap ( Figure 22 ), which is available to purchase 
separately (customer preference).  These caps provide a higher degree of mechanical protection to 
the connector than the tra nsport caps.  
Refer to section 9.4 for details on the types of caps and dummy connectors available for protection 
during storage.  
 
Connectors and hose / cable assemblies must be stored in a clean dry area and be protected by 
bubble wrap or similar.  
 Caution.  Risk of material damage. I f storage is carried out in saline conditions, e.g. on a 
shipâs deck or hold, then a Subsea Environment Cap or Dummy Plug connector should be 
used to protect the receptacle pins from corrosion.

It is recommended to store products in their original packaging (e.g. wooded crates or boxes, noting 
outdoor storage of crates per section Error! Reference source not found. ). 
Carbon steel must not be present in the storage of the products, to avoid contamination of the 
stainless steel products.  
If product has been recovered from  subsea use, it should be cleaned  before storage. Clean only with 
fresh water or 50% citric acid solution. If 50% citric acid wash is not performed, as a  minimum , wash 
with clean water to remove an y saltwater  on the products.  
 Short term storage  
Storage where temperature and humidity are no t controlled should be limited to 4 weeks.  
Storage temperature range: -40Â°C to +50Â°C air temperature (  -40 to 122Â°F).  Storage humidity below 
75%.  Maximum skin temperature of the product should not exceed 70Â°C (158Â°F), including solar 
gain due to exposure  to sunlight radiation.  
 
 Caution.  Risk of material damage. Maximum storage temperature accounts for solar gain. 
Skin temperature must not exceed 70 Â°C. Suitable protection must be used to ensure 
maximum storage temperature is not exceeded.  
 
 Long term connector storage  
These recommendations apply to products both prior to and after assembly to other equipment (e.g. 
XT, manifolds, SCM).  
Ambient air temperature should be between -40Â°C and +50 Â°C (-40 to 122Â°F).  Storage humidity 
below 75% .  Very moist  or very dry conditions should be avoided. The equipment  should be protected 
from strong sunlight and strong artificial light with a high ultraviolet content.  
Maximum skin temperature of the product should not exceed 70Â°C (158Â°F), including solar gain due 
to exposure to sunlight radiation.  
After 5 years storage it is recommended to perform a visual examination and electrical tests to 
confirm the product is still fit for purpose and within specification.  Check for any oil -leaks or obvious 
signs of damage to  the connectors (refer to section 8).  Refer to âSite Receiving Testâ document SRT -
002 (available on the Siemens -Energy/subsea website) for electri cal test requirements.  
For product already assembled onto other equipment, the test regime of that piece of equipment 
shall take precedence over the SRT document, e.g. IR tests may not be allowable; function test may 
applicable.  
Beyond 5 years storage, re -inspection and test is recommended every 2 years and before the 
product is put into service.  
For products stored at air temperatures continually above 25Â°C it is recommended to perform re -
inspection and test every 12 months.  
 
 Caution.  Risk of material da mage. Maximum storage temperature accounts for solar gain. 
Skin temperature must not exceed 70 Â°C (158Â°F) . Suitable protection must be used to 
ensure maximum storage temperature is not exceeded.  
 Caution.  Risk of material damage. Connectors should not be allowed to encounter 
solvents, oil, grease or other semi -solid materials.

If glanded connectors are t o be stored bolted into their interfaces prior to cable termination, ensure 
the cable entry point into the gland is covered to prevent dirt and water ingress.  
 Long term storage of elastomers  
For the recommended storage of elastomeric components e.g. termin ation sleeves and cable boots, 
please refer to Siemens Energy  Subsea Document MH006 â Procedure for Storage and Handling 
of Elastomeric Materials, available from Siemens Energy  Technical Support.  
 Repackaging to prevent damage in transport  
In the event of a requirement to return any product back to the manufacturer (Siemens Energy 
Subsea Connectors), it is recommended that the transport cap, protective cap, or suitable dust cap 
is fitted to the connector(s) and care should be taken to protec t the connector(s) with bubble wrap or 
similar non -fibrous wrapping materials to avoid any surface damage.  Do not use cloths, especially 
any contaminated with oil, grease or other substances.  
Use the original packaging supplied with the product wherever p ossible.  
If there are multiple connectors to be returned, it is recommended that a suitably reinforced box be 
used to withstand the weight and allow shipping in one consignment. Contact Siemens Energy

If in doubt contact Siemens Energy  Technical Support connectortechnicalsupport.gb @siemens -
energy .com  for more detailed information.  
 
 Caution.  Risk of material damage.  All sealing surfaces interfacing to DigiTRON connectors 
shall be inlayed with Inconel 625 or similar corrosion resistant alloy, with no additional 
protection required. This is to prevent localised pitting corrosion of the interface  
 
7.1 Cathodic protection  
ROV Connectors are manufactured in super duplex stainless steel and are designed to operate 
isolated from the CP (Cathodic Protection) system.  Such connectors are supplied with all hardware 
needed to isolate the connector from the structure to w hich it will be mounted.  
ROV connectors that do get connected to the CP system will not be immediately damaged, but 
there is an increased risk of hydrogen embrittlement  of the metal (possible cracking under high 
mechanical stresses), and increased rate of calcareous deposits on the product (which may cause 
problems demating the connectors).  
 
Stainless steel 316L (UNS S31603) diver  and stab  mate connectors must be connected to the CP 
(Cathodic Protection) system at all times .  
Do not fit âbraceletâ anodes ar ound hose or cable as part of CP protection.  These can easily damage 
the hose or cable as the anodes corrode.

Installation of flange mounted dummy connectors is the same procedure as for non-dummy 
connectors, so please follow the installation instructions in the relevant sections.  
 
 Testing of connectors  
For testing of products in a dry environment (topside) The appropriate test connector must always 
be used to make electrical contact during testing.  
For testing connectors in a wet environment, a standard subsea co nnector must be used.  Siemens 
connectors should not be used as pressure barrier in a pressure vessel, they are not intended for 
this use.  
If present, guide pins must never be removed from test connectors as this can lead to damage and 
will invalidate the connector warranty.  
 Danger!  Risk of imminent danger to life or risk of severe personal injury.  
Sudden release of stored pressure.  
DigiTRON products are not intended for use as a penetration for fixed top -side or land -
based pressure vessels.  They are not designed to comply with the requirements of the 
Pressure Equipment Directive (2014/68/EU).  They are intended for integration into 
subsea equipment only.  
All pressure testing of DigiTRON product must be undertaken by a competent person.  
 Danger!  Risk of death from electric shock from a damaged test connector  
- Never hold a test connector while electrically energised  
- Do not use a test connector i f it appears damaged in any way.  
 Danger!  Risk of death from electric shock from improper use of test connector.  Never 
disassemble test connectors.  In particular, removal of the rubber termination sleeves 
placed over the joint between the cable and the test connector is prohibited, as this may 
expose live parts to the user.  
- Never disassemble a test connector  
 Caution.  Risk of material damage. The appropriate test connector must always be used 
to make electrical contact during testing. Under no circumstances should a foreign object 
(such as a scr ewdriver, test probe or crocodile clip) be used as a test connection as this 
could damage the seals and insulation. Such actions will invalidate the product warranty.

 Caution . Risk of material damage.  Test connectors should never be used in water.  There  
is a high change of damage to the test connector and also to the connector under test.  
 
Below are  some images of standard  dry (topside)  Siemens Energy  test connectors . 
 
Figure 19  Dry (Topside) Test connectors, ROV, Diver and Stab -plate type  
 
Alternatively, a standard subsea connector  (e.g. Figure 20 ) tailed with cable  can be used as a test 
connector. This is preferred by some users as it hides the rubber  termination sleeves inside the 
body of the connector, eliminat ing the possibility  for the rubber termination sleeves to be removed  
by the user  (refer to Danger! note s above).  
Siemens can provide such  connectors tailed with appropriate cables  (Siemens reco mmendation), 
or untailed.  
See section 7.2.6  for instruction on installing cable tails.  
 
Figure 20  Example of standard subsea connector (shown untailed)  
 
All test connectors should be periodically inspected and cleaned (refer to section 9.6).  Electrical 
integrity should be checked by performing an In sulation Resistance and Contact Resistance test.  
Check that there is no debris or dirt on the connector; this can be transferred to the connector 
under test, e specially male pins and front face of the plug connector.  It is good practice to inspect 
the tes t connector before every use.

Check that pins are not bent, and the gold plated tips of the pins are in good condition.  
A gauge can be used to check straightness of the pins; 3d model supplied by Siemens Energy, 
which can be used to a 3d print the gauge.  See Figure 21 .

 Installation of cable tails  (applies to all products)  
Siemens connector s can be supplied with t ails (Siemens recommendation)  or without.  
Cable tails  require soldering into the solder cups on the rear of the connector.   Each termination 
must be protected by a termination sleeve suppl ied with the connector.  
Only a Suitably Qualified and Experienced Person (SQEP) should install the cable tails, e.g. 
person trained by Siemens  Energy.  
Siemens Energy installation procedure should be used .

9 PRODUCT OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE  
9.1 Safety precautions  
Before use, read section 3 on product safety advice.  
9.2 Product maintenance  and servicing  
DigiTRON products require zero maintenance for their 30 year subsea lifetime  and up to 250 subsea 
mate and de -mate  cycles.  
There are no user serviceable parts in the connectors.  Disassembly of the product should not be 
attempted.  If there are any problems developed with the product then the user should contact 
Siemens Energy  Technical Support for advice  
9.3 Subsea p rotection of receptacle contact pins  
 Caution.  Risk of material damage , corrosion of the exposed male pin in the receptacle 
connector.  
28 days is the maximum cumulative allowable exposure of unprotected receptacle pins to 
seawater over the lifetime of the connector  
Always immediately fit a Subsea Environment Cap or Dummy Plug to the 
receptacle in order to protect the pins from corrosion.  
 Caution.  Risk of material damage. Under no circumstances must the contact pins in the 
receptacle connector be exposed to seawater with power on . 
If this situation does occur the electrical connector could be destroyed (depending on 
electrical energy availa ble). At a minimum, the contact surfaces of the pins will very rapidly 
degrade by electrolytic action. If these damaged pins are subsequently mated into a socket 
insert there is a very high risk  of damage to the insulation and seals within the plug 
connect or. 
 Caution . Risk of material damage.  It is important to isolate and earth prior to disconnect 
in order to remove any stray charges in the system. If left, this can induce corrosion on the 
exposed pins once the plug is removed.

9.4 Product protection; c aps and dummy connectors  
There are five types of caps and dumm y connectors available to protect the product in use.  The 
following gives the use case for each type.  
 Topside caps  
â¢ Transport cap : Supplied with the connector to protect it against damage during transport 
(Figure 22 ) 
â¢ Protective cap : Provides greater degree of mechanical protection to the connector than the 
transport cap.  Recommended for  when connectors are exposed to higher risk of damage  
outside of transportation  (Figure 22 ) 
Topside  caps can simply be pushed on or removed by hand  
Topside caps shou ld not be deployed subsea.  
 Caution.  Risk of material damage. If storage is carried out in saline conditions, e.g. on a 
shipâs deck or hold, then a Subsea Environment Cap or Dummy Plug connector should be 
used to protect the receptacle pins from corrosion.  
 
    
Figure 22  ROV -type Transport Caps (le ft) and Protective Caps  
 
 Subsea caps  
â¢ Subsea Protective Caps : Provides mechanical protection to the plug or receptacle connector  
(Figure 23 ). It is a non-electrical  cap. The cap for the plug connector (female sockets, oil -
filled) can be used for long -term mechanical protection.  The cap for the receptacle (exposed 
male pins) does not  protect the exposed male pins in the receptacle from corrosion.  It should 
only be used for very short -term subsea use, e.g. the cap is removed within a few days  after 
deployment and the flying lead connected to receptacle  (noting that  the 28 days maximum in 
section 9.3) 
â¢ Subsea Environment Cap : Provides mechanical protection to the receptacle connector (male 
pins)  including  corrosion protection of the exposed pins.  This is a non-electrica l cap. To be 
used where the receptacle connector will be left un -mated for any length of time.   Subse a 
Environment Caps can be identified by their red -coloured disc and labelled âzero voltsâ ( Figure 
24 and Figure 26 ) 
â¢ Dummy Connectors . Provides mechanical and electrical protection to the plug or receptacl e, 
including  corrosion protection of the exposed pins in the receptacle  (Figure 25 ). These 
connectors have  full electrical rating . They can be configured at time of order to be open -

Unrestricted   
circuit or looped  with wire or resistors  (labelled as shown in Figure 26 ). These connectors 
should be used everywhere the system will be electrically energised or for electrical testing.  
In locations where marine growth activity is prevalent, it is advised to fit a dummy receptacle 
connector to the plug for enhanced protection.   A time limit when dummy connectors should be 
used cannot be given, as the type and rate of marine growth activity varies enormously for each 
circumstance and location.   The end user is bes t placed to know the risk associated with marine 
growth for the particular location and circumstances. If other options are required please contact 
Siemens Technical  department.

9.5 Live Mate / De -mate  
The connectors are not designed to be mated or de -mated while electrically energised.  Depending 
on the type of electrical load , the following advice should be followed.  
 Danger!  Risk of death from electric shock due to exposed live pins, e.g. factory or top -side 
system test and unmated receptacle is energised.  
- Ensu re all test procedures are followed.  
- Communication channels and protocols are observed.  
 Caution . Risk of material damage.  The maximum number of live mate / de -mate 
operations under any of these conditions is ONE only.  There is a high risk of damage 
to both plug and receptacle connector that would render it unusable.  
 
Resistive loads  
Mating the connectors should not lead to any damage to the sealing mechanisms within the plugs.  
Following this de -mating procedure, testing should be carried out on the connector to establish if any 
damage has occurred. Under no circumstances shall connectors be partially mated with power on.  
Capacitive loads  
Mating with power on will lead to an in -rush current.  The magnitude of this in -rush current will depend 
on the capacitance of the circuit. It is very important that the in -rush current is no more than 100A 
for 5 seconds.  
Inductive loads  
Mating the connectors should not lead to any damage to the sealing mechanisms within the inserts. 
De-mating must not be attempted as there is a risk of high back EMFâs which will cause damage 
to the seals and insulation within the inserts.

9.6 Inspection and cleaning of connector products  
All connector products should be thoroughly inspected before use, refer to section 8.2 for faults to 
look for.  
Connectors can be safely cleaned using Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) and lint -free cloth, but d o not soak 
the product in IPA.  Allow time for IPA to evaporate before mating the connector together.  Be careful 
not to leave any cloth fibres on the front -face of the plug or on the receptacle pins.  Other cleaning 
fluids should not be used as they may not be compatible with the rubbers or plastics u sed in the 
product.   
Under no circumstances should a foreign object be used to depress the shuttle pins of the plug  
connector . 
9.7 Removal of  marine growth and calcareous deposits  
To remove calcite growth from Siemens Energy  Subsea connectors, a solution of 5 0% Citric Acid is 
recommended. All seawater exposed elastomeric materials in Siemens Energy  Subsea connectors 
have been fully tested against 50% Citric Acid and are compatible for a duration of 1 hour. In addition, 
the thermoplastic materials have a good r esistance to citric acid.  
 Warning.  Risk of minor personal injury to persons with sensitivities to a solution of 50% 
Citric Acid, should wear appropriate hand and eye protection when handling.  
 Caution.  Risk of material damage. Other acid cleaners, such as 50% Acetic Acid, should 
not be used as they may cause deterioration of the elastomeric materials.  
 Caution.  Risk of material damage. Chiselling and abrasive methods are not 
recommended. Use of a water jet is acceptable, but the jet should not be directed into the 
shuttle pins at the front of the plug as this could result in a risk of water being forced through 
the primary seals.  
 
9.8 Testing of product  
Refer to  section 7.2.5  
9.9  Checks before mating the product  
Transport and topside protection caps must be removed before subsea deployment  
Before mating, the receptacle connector (male pins) should be checked for debris and damage. The 
connectors have been designed to accommodate sand and silt contamination;  however large pieces 
of debris should be removed. Use a water jet if subse a, but do not direct the water jet at the front 
face (seals) of the plug connector  
Inspect the receptacle pins for any signs of damage, such as bent pins, blackening due to electrical 
faults, or corrosion of the pins (green colour)  or others in section 8.2. 
Check the front -face of the plug connector (red -coloured rubber sealing element).  There should be 
no tears to the rubber or any darkening of colour.  
If evidence of such faults exists , do not use the connector.  Please contact Siemens Energy  Technical 
Support for advice.

 ROV connector alignment and mating  
 
Refer to Figure 27  for images of alignment marks and mating  
â¢ DigiTRON connectors have been designed to self -align during mating.  
â¢ The connectors must be roughly aligned using the alignment marks on the plug body, 
flange and receptacle cone.  
â¢ The mounting of the ROV handle has sufficient compliance to accommodate fine 
adjustments during the final approach prior to connector engagement . 
â¢ Ensure correct orientation of the alignment disc  
â¢ It is important that the ROV compliant flange is orientated correctly.  
â¢ Observe the text on the flange and orientate accordingly.

person view, i.e. view from behind the connector.  A thin orange -colour line approx. 2mm 
may be visible from side -on view.  
â¢ If the lip seal can still be seen from the first -person view, remove and retry making 
connection by following the procedure again.  
â¢ If connectors canât be mated both the plug and receptacle need to be inspected for any mis -
alignment damage or debris that is preventing connection.  
â¢ If any damage has occurr ed, please contact Siemens Energy  Technical Support for advice.  
 
 ROV connector m aximum misalignment values and mating forces  
Refer to section 5.1 
 ROV connector de -mating  
De-mating is achieved by a straight pull on the ROV handle , sufficient to release the latching 
mechanism.  
Force required is detailed under the mechanical forces in section 5.1 
For topside use , e.g. during system testing, there is a hand operated ROV de -mate tool available to 
make connector de -mate by hand easier and safe.  It is recommended that this tool should alwa ys 
be used topside. Part number BQ -30090 -00. See Figure 28  
 
 
Figure 28  ROV de -mate tool, pa rt number BQ -30090 -00 
 
 Warning. Risk of musculoskeletal injury from hand -mating o r de-mating connectors.  
- Referring to the mate / de -mate forces specified herein, ensure suitable manual 
handling precautions are taken and the topside de -mate tool is used  
- Ensure all product testing activities are completed by competent persons in 
accorda nce with relevant procedures.

9.11 Stab -plate connectors mating and de -mating  
  Stab -plate connector mating and de -mating  
Stab-plate connector do not have any latching mechanism.  The connectors are mated together by 
the force of the stab -plate. There is no special operation needed to de -mate the connector, simply 
the stab -plate is withdrawn and the connector s separate.  
Only the alignment of the key and the maximum misalignment values need to be adhered to, refer 
to section 5.1. 
  Partial disconnection  and interrupted connection  
Partial disconnection with the contact pin remaining between the primary and secondary diaphragms 
is not recommended, as there is a risk of damag ing the insulation. If it is necessary to operate the 
connectors partially mated, the connectors should be separated by 8.6 â 9.2mm (0.340  - 0.360â ) 
from the nominal, mated, stab distance. In this condition the level of insulation between the contact 
pin a nd socket contact is reduced and the connector is relying on the primary seals within the plug. 
There is also an increased risk of insulation break down at voltages above 500V.  
Interrupted connection (i.e. Partial mate to full de -mate) can be carried out w ithout any  
adverse effect  to connectors, as long as the power is off.  
 
9.12 Diver operated connectors mating and de -mating  
  Diver operated connector mating and de -mating  
The clamp ring should be rotated clockwise by hand until tight. The connectors are designed to 
remain clamped together with only firm hand tightness on the clamp ring. If a clamping torque is 
used, this MUST NOT exceed 20Nm  (15 lbf.ft) .  A 2-3â C-spanner c an be used for this operation.  
De-mating is simply a reverse of this process.  
  Diver operated connector maximum misalignment values  
These connectors have been designed to self -align during mating. All that is required is to ensure 
that the alignment pin on  the plug connector is engaged in the alignment groove within the receptacle 
connector before screwing the clamp ring up.  
  Diver operated connector post mating checks  
Full engagement of the connectors can be checked through the viewing hole in the clamp  ring. If the 
connectors are fully mated,  then no gap should be visible between the plug and receptacle , refer to

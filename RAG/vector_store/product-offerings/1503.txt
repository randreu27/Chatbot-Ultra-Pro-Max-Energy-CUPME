Siemens Energy brings spin -off year 
to a solid conclusion   
• Guidance  for fiscal year 2020 achieved  in difficult market environment  
• New orders up despite global pandemic ; order backlog of 
EUR 79 billion  and pre-tax free cash flow of EUR 977 million  
• Operating earnings  impacted  by special items ; with adjusted EBITA 
before special  items near break -even at EUR (17) million   
• Gas and Power and SGRE segments perform ed well in Q4  
• Siemens Energy will no longer support  developing new power plant 
projects for coal -based electricity generation  
 
Siemens Energy delivered a solid  operating performance  
for fiscal year  2020  and achieved its guidance. The newly listed company  
increased new orders 1% from the prior year, to  EUR 34 billion  – amid a 
challenging macroeconomic environment which was dominated by the 
COVID -19 pandemic . Key projects included an order  for the seventh 
offshore wind farm grid connection in the North Sea, and an agreement 
on the first megawatt -level production facility for green hydrogen in 
China. Siemens  Energy ended the fiscal year with an order backlog 
totaling EUR 79 billion .  
 
Dr. Ch ristian Bruch, CEO of Siemens Energy AG:   
“I am proud how our Siemens Energy team managed the macroeconomic 
challenges, successfully executed the spin -off of our company while 
further streamlining our portfolio. We have fully achieved our fiscal year 
2020 guidance and confirm our outlook for fiscal year 2021.  
With an outstanding and committed team we look forward to the 
transformation journey that lies ahead of us, as we are opening a new 
chapter as Siemens Energy. ” Press  Release

Deutschland  Though the company’s revenue  in fiscal year 2020  was d own 5% from 
the prior year, to EUR 27.5 billion , the decrease was still within the 
projected target range of (5%) to (2%). The book -to-bill ratio – the ratio 
of new orders to revenue – was a strong 1.24. 
 
Special items  affect operating earnings   
Despite  headwinds from  COVID -19, adjusted EBITA before special  items 
was EUR (17) million , just short of break -even . This translated to an 
adjusted EBITA  margin  of (0. 1%) before special  items .  
 
Siemens Energy continue s to implement the optimization program 
presented in early  September . Adjustments of production capacities  in 
France and Norway have already been initiated. Additionally, in response 
to a drop in demand and unfavorable market conditions, Siemens Energy 
had decided to adjust  its aero -derivative gas turbine portfolio . Portfolio -
related impairments and write -downs totaled EUR 956 million. Another 
aspect was restructuring expenses of EUR  376 million, as well as non -
recurring costs of EUR  195 million associated w ith the carve -out and  
other special items. Therefore, Siemens Energy’s operating earnings  in 
fiscal year 2020 were  negatively impacted by special  items amounting to 
approximately EUR 1.5 billion .  
 
Strong cash flow  
These special  items brought the net loss for fiscal year 2020 to 
EUR 1.9 billion . By contrast , however, strong free cash flow before taxes 
came to EUR 977 million , primarily due to a significant reduction in  
inventories and accounts receivable  in Gas and Power.  
 
Basic earnings per share (EPS) amounted to EUR (2.21). As already 
announced earlier this year, t he Executive  Board will propose to the 
Supervisory Board not to distribute a dividend for 2020, the company’s 
first independent fiscal year .

Deutschland  Q4 shows positive earnings before special items  
Compared  with the strong equivalent quarter last year, which benefited 
from new orders at both Gas and Power and SGRE , Siemens Energy  
achieved a solid fourth quarter in 2020 . As anticipated , new orders 
decre ased 24% to EUR 7 billion , primarily as orders were postponed due 
to COVID -19 in the Gas and Power segment .  
 
Siemens Energy’s revenue decreased by 8% to €7.6  billion in the fourth  
quarter, which was impacted primarily by an 11% decline in revenue in 
the Gas and Power segment. This was attributable to delays and 
postponed projects mainly due to the COVID -19 pandemic. In contrast, 
the downturn in revenue in the SGRE segment was moder ate. 
 
Siemens Energy reported a djusted  EBITA before special  items of 
EUR 70 million  in the fourth quarter, equivalent to an adjusted EBITA  
margin of 0.9% before special  items . Without special  items of 
EUR 402 million  Q4 results would have been very strong and in line with 
previous year . Operational weaknesses in the onshore business at SGRE 
continue to negatively impact Q4 adjusted EBITA before special items.  In 
total, the net loss at Siemens Energy  Group  level stood at EUR 390 
million. This was set against strong free cash flow before taxes, in an 
amount of EUR 704 million.  
 
Maria Ferraro, CFO of Siemens Energy:  
“In a market environment that remains challenging and uncertain, 
Siemens Energy delivered a solid fourth quarter . Both at  the Group level 
and in the Gas and Power  and SGRE  segment s, we showed an operating 
profit before special  items . We continue to diligently focus on the tasks at 
hand, specifically reviewing all levers to improv e our cost efficiency  
which increas e profitabi lity and cash flow . It is a journey, although we 
see progress so far and are on the right track .”

Deutschland  Guidance for  2021 confirmed  
Siemens Energy is confirming the guidance . That projection  is still based 
on the assumption that there will be no further adverse impact from the 
pandemic . The outlook  for Siemens Energy in fiscal year 2021 includes  
nominal revenue performance of between 2% and 12% and an adjusted 
EBITA  margin of 3% to 5%, before  special  items . 
The Gas and Power segment  is expected to show nominal revenue 
performance within a target range of between 2% and 11% in fiscal year 
2021, with an adjusted EBITA  margin of 3.5% to 5.5% , before special  
items .  
Nominal revenue growth for the SGRE  segment  is expected to be 
between 3% and 12% , driven by the order backlog to date and stable 
performance in the Service and Product business . The adjusted EBITA  
margin before special  items is projected at 3% to 5%. 
 
No f urther involvement in developing new coal -fired power plant 
projects  
Effective immediately , Siemens Energy will no longer participate in new 
tenders for pure coal-fired power plants. Siemens Energy will still meet 
the existing commitments  for coal-fired power plant projects , including 
binding offers.  It will also continue its CO 2-reducing service and solutions 
business , e.g. combined heat and power (CHP) projec ts. Siemens Energy 
is now further analyzing  with the requisite care what specific 
consequences this step will have for its employees and sites that are 
concerned.  Siemens Energy will now discuss with its partners in the field 
of coal -fired power plant tech nology about the consequences of the 
decision for the partnerships .  
 
Accompanying  its customers on the path of energy transformation and 
providing  the necessary technologies and solution s – that is the mission  
of the company.  With this step, Siemens Energy continues its 
transformation towards a more sustainable and growth -oriented 
portfolio.  Overall, sustainable  solutions already generate  
more than 50% of Siemens Energy's revenue.

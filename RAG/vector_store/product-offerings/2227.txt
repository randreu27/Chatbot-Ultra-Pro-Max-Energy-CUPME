take a break
May 2025•The gas -fired Lincoln Combustion Turbine Station, built for energy provider 
Duke Energy, ensures a stable supply of electricity when power from solar 
generation is not available . 
•The installed heavy -duty HL -class gas turbine can reach full capacity within 
minutes. Innovative simulation was used in its design and material 
development to account for the extreme stresses caused by quick starts 
and to ensure durability. 
•Its high performance earned two GUINNESS WORLD RECORDSTMtitles, 
for the most powerful simple -cycle gas power plant and for the world’s 
fastest ramp -up rate by a 60 Hz gas turbine power plant. 
•Combining sensor data with Artificial Intelligence during testing helped to 
optimize design and maintenance, and enabled condition and dispatch 
simulations, resulting in reliable, efficient, and flexible power for the future.Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S.

The world’s first recyclable 
wind turbine blade
May 2025•RecyclableBlade is the world’s first recyclable blade ready 
for commercial use offshore and onshore. 
•Together with its partner Aditya Birla Advanced Materials, 
Siemens Gamesa has developed a novel recyclable epoxy 
resin system that makes it possible to efficiently separate the 
resin from the other components at the end of the blade’s 
working life. This allows the materials to be recycled for new 
applications. 
•At RWE’s Kaskasi offshore wind power project in Germany, 
the first RecyclableBlades were installed in July 2021 
and are now delivering green energy. Aalborg, Denmark

Drive industry decarbonization
© Siemens Energy, 2025 11The industrial sector globally accounts for 30% of emissions and ~38% of energy consumption.1
Industry needs to reduce emissions by 5 Gigatons per year . Green hydrogen is a key player in the 
decarbonized energy system of the future. It can decarbonize sectors that are difficult to electrify, 
such as steel production and heavy -duty transportation. 
Our offerings
We decarbonize industrial processes through four main levers:
•Energy efficiency: Increasing efficiency of existing assets by consuming less energy.
•Electrification: Converting industrial processes from fossil fuels to electricity.
•Hydrogen: Producing and transporting green hydrogen and clean fuels, already starting 
in hard to abate sectors to replace fossil fuels in processes that cannot be electrified.
•Digitalization: Driving value creation and customer -centricity through digital offerings 
across Siemens Energy portfolio .
Our offerings include electrolyzers , industrial steam turbines, industrial generators, turbo and 
reciprocating compressors, compressor trains, drive systems and solutions, batteries and fuel cells, 
as well as service and digital solutions for the entire portfolio.

Direct Air Capture
May 2025 © Siemens Energy, 2025 19•Direct air capture (DAC) technologies remove CO2from the atmosphere 
anywhere, resulting in a highly concentrated stream of green CO2, 
allowing for its permanent storage or usein various processes such as 
synthetic fuels.
•Capturing CO2from the air is one of the most expensive methods of 
carbon capture. However, forecasted demand and price range of green 
CO2used as feedstock or for carbon removal credits ,enables the 
market and provides commercial viability .
•To scale DAC, Siemens Energy has developed a resilient sorbent 
agnostic, amine -based, pressure -temperature swing DAC solution. The 
solution emphasizes energy recovery and effluent utilization, while also 
allowing location flexibility through a self -sustaining electrically powered 
thermal process or integration of available waste -heat streams.
•Under the framework of a joint development agreement Siemens 
Energy and Saudi Aramco are currently cooperating to bring our first 
large -scale DAC pilot project to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Intelligent Asset Twin
•Digital Twin (DT) Architecture is essential to improve the reliability, 
availability, and maintainability of assets manufactured by Siemens 
Energy and a their associated packages, while also lowering 
operational costs. DT enables a shift from scheduled maintenance to 
condition -based maintenance, minimizing unplanned downtime and 
optimizing maintenance costs. 
•This is a key step in digitizing the domain expertise that Siemens 
Energy has in Compressor Stations, Power Plants, Waste to Energy 
Plants and many others for the benefit of our customers.
•Siemens Energy with comprehensive knowledge in core asset design, 
service and operations empowered by the latest prescriptive AI, LLM 
and XR tech.

Sustainable and flexible power generation with PEM Fuel Cells
May 2025•Fuel cells play a crucial role in decarbonization. They g enerate zero 
emission power with hydrogen for ancillary services and peak power 
demand.
•Utilization across various sectors, including heavy duty transportation, 
maritime, power generation, and industrial applications. They align with 
stringent industry regulations and environmental standards. Customers 
actively seek alternative energy sources as add on to the existing 
demand on the power grid. 
•PEM fuel cells offer several advantages, including high efficiency, low 
emissions, quiet operation and rapid startup time. With decreasing 
costs, fuel cells become an economically viable option for businesses 
looking to invest in clean energy solutions. With a reliability of 99.999% 
the system can provide continuous power during grid outages, making 
them ideal for critical infrastructure.
•Our PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) Fuel Cells provide on site high 
quality electrical power during power outages for more than 24 hours as 
a scalable solution based on highly modular design up to multi -MW 
installations (3 MW net).

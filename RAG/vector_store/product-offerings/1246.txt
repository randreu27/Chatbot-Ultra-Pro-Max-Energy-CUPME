Siemens Energy  – Half-year Financial Report  2025 
 Orders  
• Favorable trends in the energy market, particularly increasing electricity consumption, have led to rising demand for our pro ducts, solutions, 
and services. This was clearly  reflected in the substantial  growth in the volume of large orders. As a result, Siemens Energy ’s orders increased 
significantly on a comparable basis (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects). The growth rate in the service bu siness outpaced the 
increase in the new units business significantly , raising the service share of Siemens Energy’s orders to 37% (2024: 32%).  
• Orders at Gas Services (GS)  rose sharply . The  volume from large orders more than doubled. Orders grew s harply  in both the new units and 
service businesses, with the increase in the new units business being notably stronger.  
• Orders at Grid Technologies (GT)  decreased significantly compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to the lower volume from large 
orders. While GT’s product business achieved moderate growth, orders in the solutions business saw a substantial  decline compared to the high 
prior -year level.  
• Orders at Transformation of Industry (TI) clearly declined . This was mainly due to the sharp decrease in the volume from large orders. In the 
prior year, several exceptionally large orders were recorded in the Compression and Industrial Steam Turbines & Generators bu sinesses.  
• Siemens Gamesa (SG)  experienced a s ubstantial  increase in orders, as the rise on offshore far outweighed the decline in the onshore area . The 
offshore growth was primarily driven by a large order in the North Sea worth €1.4 billion, while onshore orders were affected by the follow -on 
effects from or continuation of the temporary interruption  of sales activities for the 4.X and 5.X platforms.  
• Siemens Energy’s book -to-bill ratio was 1.49 (2024: 1.56). The order backlog reached a new high of €133 billion, compared to €123 billion at 
the end of the prior fiscal year.  
• In geographical terms, sharp  and significant  growth on a comparable basis in the reporting regions of Americas and Asia, Australia  respectively 
was accompanied by a moderate decline in Europe, C.I.S., Middle East, Africa (EMEA) .  
• The development in EMEA  was driven by the decline in the GT and TI segments. Their regional orders decreased primarily due to the 
aforementioned reduction in the volume from large orders. In contrast, GS and SG recorded very strong growth in orders, with the 
aforementioned large  order being decisive for SG.  
• Growth in Americas  was based on sharp  or substantial  increases across all segments. The largest contribution to growth came from GS, followed 
by GT. The development in the reporting region was determined by demand from the United States , where orders from the country increased 
by more than half.  
• The development in Asia, Australia  resulted from increases in GS, GT, and TI, which more than offset a sharp  decline at SG. GS recorded the 
highest growth, with its orders in the reporting region increasing by more than half.  
Revenue  
• Siemens Energy ’s revenue increased significantly on a comparable basis. All segments contributed to this development, benefiting from both 
the processing of the high order backlog and the favorable market environment. The increase in the new units business was sli ghtly above the 
percentage growth in the service business, leaving the distribution of revenue unchanged compared to the prior year.  
• GS recorded a significant  increase, driven by a substantial  growth in the service business.  
• GT’s revenue rose substantially , with increases across all businesses. The highest growth contribution came from the solutions business, followed 
by a substantial  rise in the product business.  
• TI recorded s ignificant  revenue growth, to which all four independent businesses contributed. Compression made by far the largest growth 
contribution in terms of value,  followed by Industrial Steam Turbines & Generators.  
• SG’s revenue was significantly above the prior year’s level. This was primarily due to the new units business in the offshore area , mainl y driven 
by the ramp -up of activities. Revenue in the onshore business also grew significantly.  
• In terms of the geographical development of revenue on a comparable basis, there was substantial growth in EMEA . Asia, Australia , and 
Americas  recorded significant and clear growth, respectively.   
• In EMEA , revenue at GS, GT, and TI grew s ubstantially . SG recorded a clear  increase.  
• In Americas , the increases at GS, TI, and especially GT offset  a clear  decline at SG.  
• The growth in Asia, Australia  was primarily driven by the sharp  increase at SG. Together with the substantial increase  at GT, this outweighed 
the revenue declines at GS and TI.

Siemens Energy  – Half-year Financial Report  2025 
 Profit  and Profit  before Special items  
• The development of Siemens Energy ’s Profit reflected  operational improvements in all segments. This was primarily due to the increased volume 
and corresponding degression effects, as well as strong operational performance in processing higher -margin orders. Additionally, Profit was 
positively influenced by one-off effects. The sharp  decline in Profit was attributable to the fact that in the prior -year period, there were positive 
effects totaling €2,049 million related to disposals and the accelerated portfolio transformation of Siemens Energy (reported  as Sp ecial items in 
the Strategic portfolio decisions category). In contrast, in the past half -year, expenses of €2 65 million related to the planned sale of the Indian 
wind business were incurred, which were also reported as Special items (for further information on this transaction, see Note 2 in 3.6 Notes to 
the Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements ). Siemens Energy recorded a sharp  increase in Profit before Special items and the 
corresponding margin.  
• Profit at GS increased substantially . This was mainly driven by higher revenue in the service business  and the margin quality of the processed 
order backlog. The Profit in both  years included in total negligible Special items. As a result, Profit before Special items of GS also increased 
substantially , with the corresponding margin rising significantly  compared to the prior year.  
• GT’s Profit increased substantial ly. The largest contribution to the improvement came from the solutions business. Overall, the improvement in 
Profit was driven by a consistently strong operational performance, increased volume  – including corresponding degression effects  – and a 
higher margin of the processed order backlog compared to the prior year. Additionally, there were positive timing effects of around  €100  million. 
Negligible Special items were recorded, whereas the prior -year period had significant  positive Special items related to disposals . Consequently, 
Profit before Special items and the corresponding margin of GT increased sharply.  
• Profit at TI improved sharply  compared to the prior -year period. The largest contribution came from the Compression business, followed by 
Industrial Steam Turbines & Generators. Overall, the segment’s Profit  growth was attributable to  increased volume, particularly in the service 
business, and resulting degression effects, as well as strong operational performance and the comparatively higher margin of the processed 
order backlog. In both years, insignificant negative Special items were  recorded. Profit bef ore Special items and the corresponding margin 
increased sharply .

Industrial Steam Turbines & Generators  12.4%  9.5%  3.0 p.p.  
Compression  13.8%  10.6%  3.2 p.p.  
 
• Profit at SG decreased  significantly compared to the prior -year period. While there were positive effects due to continued growth in the offshore 
business  – which led to corresponding degression effects  – as well as project -related one -off effects, the determining factor for the Profit  
development were  the expenses reported as Special items in connection with the planned sale of the Indian wind business. Additionally, there 
were ongoing burdens from the follow -on effects of cost increases related to the ramp -up of offshore activ ities and quality issues in the onshore 
area . Negative Special items due to restructuring costs were recorded in both reporting periods. However, in the prior -year period, a gain from 
disposals had led to overall positive Special items. Together, this resulted in a strong improvement in Profit befor e Special items, with the positive 
change in the corresponding margin being even more pronounced.  
• The item Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements  includes items that management does not consider to be indicative of the 
segments’ performance , mainly group management costs (management and corporate functions) , other central items, treasury activities as well 
as elimination s. Other central items include Siemens brand fees, corporate services (e.g., management of the Group’s real estate portfolio),  
corporate projects, centrally held equity interests, and other items . The negative change in Profit in the Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial 
Statements compared to the prior -year period was due to a gain from disposal  reported as Special items in the prior year .

Siemens Energy  – Half-year Financial Report  2025 
 Net I ncome (Loss) , Basic Earnings per Share  
• After a negative Financial result in the prior -year period, a positive Financial result was recorded in the past half -year. This was primarily due to 
the temporary positive development in the  fair values of transaction -related derivatives  and interest income from cash investments due to 
increased cas h.  
• Nevertheless, the Profit development was largely decisive for Income before income taxes .  
• The Group’s effective tax rate was 29.5% (H1 FY 2024: 15.4%). It reflect s losses without corresponding tax relief at Siemens Gamesa, partially 
offset by an income tax benefit  from the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the United States  due to a restructuring 
related to the integration of Siemens Gamesa.  
• As a result of the developments described above , Siemens Energy recorded a sharply  declining Net income in the past half -year and 
correspondingly lower basic earnings per share .

Assets, liabilities and equity  
• As of March 31, 202 5, total assets of the Siemens Energy Group were clearly  above the level at the end of the pr ior fiscal year. The changes on  
both  the assets  and liabilities sides primarily reflected the increased business volume and successful business performance of Siemens Energy 
in the first half -year.  The expansionary effect of currency translation differences was of minor importance.  
• The sharp  increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted from positive cash flows from operating  activities in the past half -year  (see below).  
• Operating net working capital decreased to negative €5,892 million  (September 30, 202 4: negative  €4,107 million ). With the exception of 
SG, a ll segments contributed to this development . The largest decrease was recorded by GT , mainly as a result of increased project prepayments 
in connection with orders. The resulting increase in contract liabilities outweighed the clear  increase in inventories, which was largely related 
to volume growth.  
• Assets classified as held for disposal and Liabilities associated with assets classified as held for disposal  increased as a result of the 
agreement  to sell t he Indian wind business  (see Note 2 in 3.6 Notes to the Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements ). 
Interim Group Management Report  12 
 
Siemens Energy  – Half-year Financial Report  2025 
 • Equity increased significantly  compared to the end of the prior  fiscal year. This was primarily due to Net income and, in addition, to the positive 
other comprehensive income.  
Cash flows  
• In the past half -year, Siemens Energy achieved a sharp year -on-year increase in Free cash flow pre tax , despite higher investments . This was 
due to the operating profit development and the higher cash inflow from the change in operating net working capital, which re sulted from an 
improvement in cash flows in all items, but primarily from the change in contract liabilities and trade and other payables.  
• All segments contributed to the higher Free cash flow pre tax. GS made the largest contribution, followed by SG, which sharply reduced its 
negative Free cash flow pre tax. The increase at GS, GT, and TI was due to improved earnings and cash inflows from the change in operating net 
working capital.  The improvement at SG was primarily due to a year -on-year decrease in cash outflows from the change in operating net working 
capital, mainly due to contract liabilities related to customer prepayments.  
• The change in  cash flows from investing activities was mainly attributable to the fact that the cash inflows of €2,910 million from disposals 
and accelerated portfolio transformation in the prior -year period were not offset by any comparable cash inflows in the past half -year.  
• Cash flows from financing activities showed relatively balanced cash inflows and outflows. In contrast, financing activities in the prior -year 
period were characterized by a reduction in debt (cash outflow of €1,156 million).  
• Siemens Energy's net cash – defined  as the difference between total debt and total liquidity - amounted to €5,129  million  as of  March 31, 202 5 
(September 30, 202 4: €2,596  million ). This development is almost entirely attributable to the increase in cash and cash equivalents.

Siemens Energy  – Half-year Financial Report  2025 
 2.3 Report on expected developments  
Due to the positive business development in the first half -year and the strong market demand, Siemens Energy updated the outlook for fiscal 
year  2025 on April 16, 2025. The change in the outlook is driven by stronger than expected performances at Gas Services, Grid T echnologies and 
Transformation of Industry. Regarding  Free cash flow pre tax, the higher outlook is particularly attributable to Gas Services and Grid Technologies, 
which both experience strong cash inflows driven by customer payments related to strong ord er momentum. At Siemens Gamesa we continue to 
work on the measures to reach break -even in fiscal year 2026. We still expect sales activities for the 5.X onshore turbine to resume during fiscal 
year 2025.  
Siemens Energy now expects to achieve comparable revenue growth (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) in fis cal year 2025 in a 
range of 13% to 15% (before 8% and 10%) and a Profit margin before Special items between 4% and 6% (before betwe en 3% and 5%). 
Siemens  Energy expects a Net income of up to €1  billion  (before around break -even) excluding assumed positive Special items subsequent to the 
demerger of the energy business from Siemens Limited, India. The outlook for Free cash flow pre tax  was already updated on January 27, 2025. 
After  higher -than -expected Free cash flow pre tax in the first quarter of the fiscal year , Siemens Energy expects to exceed the previous outlook  for 
fiscal year 2025 of up to €1 billion . The outlook for Free cash flow pre tax for the fiscal year 2025 is updated to around €4  billion.  
The outlook for Siemens Energy does not include charges related to any future legal and regulatory matters.  
Amended overall assumptions per business area  
• GS assumes a comparable revenue growth of 11% to 13% (before 7% to 9%) and a Profit margin before Special items of 11% to 13% (b efore 
10% to 12%).  
• GT plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of 24% to 26% (before 23% to 25%) and a Profit margin before Special items betwe en 14% 
and 16% (before between 10% and 12%).  
• TI expects a comparable revenue growth of 13% to 15% (before 11% to 13%) and a Profit margin before Special items of 9% to 11% ( before 8% 
to 10%).  
• SG assumes a comparable revenue growth of 0% to 2% (before negative 9% to negative 5%) and a negative Profit before Special item s of around 
€1.3 billion (unchanged).

 3.6 Notes to Half -year Consolidated Financial 
Statements  
NOTE 1 Basis of presentation  
The accompanying Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements as of March  31, 2025 , present the operations of Siemens  Energy  AG with 
registered office  at Otto -Hahn -Ring 6, 81739 Munich, Germany (registry number HRB 252581 , local court Munich ), and its subsidiaries.  
The Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements are in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) applicable t o interim 
financial reporting as adopted by the European Union (EU). The Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements shoul d be read in conjunction with 
the Siemens  Energy Consolidated Financial Statements as of September  30, 2024. Results for the interim reporting period are not necessarily 
indicative of future results.  
The Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements apply the same accounting principles and practices, including mainly the underlying as sumptions 
and estimation uncertainties, as those used in fiscal year 2024 Consolidated Financial Statements.  
Income tax expense in the interim periods is calculated based on the currently expected effective tax rate  (ETR)  of Siemens Energy for the full year. 
Siemens Energy AG is subject to the scope of the global minimum taxation (Pillar Two) starting Fiscal Year 2025. According to  IAS 12 Income Taxes, 
Siemens Energy Group did not recognize any potential effects regarding deferred tax assets and liabilities. Effects based on the application of the 
global minimum taxation are taken into account in the income tax liability . There will probably  be no material impact on Siemens Energy Group's 
ETR. 
The Half-year Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared  and published in millions of euro s (€ million). Rounding  differences may 
occur in respect of individual amounts or  percentages.  
The Half -year Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited and were authorized for issue by the Executive  Board on April  30, 2025 . 
Siemens  Energy  is one of the largest suppliers of technology in the energy and electricity sector , serving  the entire scope of the energy market. It 
provides a portfolio along the entire energy value chain in both conventional and renewable energy, complemented  by a complete  set of training 
and service offerings. This comprehensive portfolio is aimed at  public - and private -sector customers along the continuum of energy – from power 
generation to power transmission and related services.  
The reporting structure of Siemens Energy Group consists of the Business Areas Gas Services  (GS), Grid Technologies  (GT), Transformation of 
Industry  (TI) and our Wind Power business  Siemens Gamesa (SG) and the Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Business Areas 
GS, GT and SG represent reportable segments. The Business Area TI comprises four operating but non -reportable segments (Sustainable Energy 
Systems (SES), Electrification, Automation, Digitalization (EAD), Industrial Steam Turbines  & Generators (STG) and Compression (CP)) , which are 
presented voluntarily as if they were a single reportable segment , despite some differences in its economic characteristics.  
Certain prior -year figures have been restated. Beginning with fiscal year 2025, SG segment’s Real Estate Portfolio, formerly shown under th e 
correspondent segment, is assigned to Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements. Related prior year infor mation has been reclassified to 
conform to the current year presentation.

 NOTE  2 Assets held for disposal  
Sale of the Indian wind busines s 
On March 2 6, 2025, Siemens  Energy signed an agreement for the sale of its Indian wind business to Peony Properties Private Limited,  which is 
registered in Mumbai, India , and owned by a group of investors led by TPG . The business includes the manufacturing, installation, and service of 
onshore wind turbines in India and Sri Lanka. As part of the agreement, Siemens Energy will transfer employees and two manufacturing plants in 
India to Peony Properties Private Limited . Siemens Energy will hold a 10% interest in the comp any. Closing of the transaction is expected for the 
second half of calendar year 2025.  
The assets and liabilities asso ciated with the transaction were classified as “held for disposal” as of March  31, 2025 . The major classes of assets and 
liabilities of the disposal group  are detailed in the table s below. The measurement of the disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount and 
fair value less costs to sell resulted in an impair ment loss of € 240 million  as well as a provision for onerous contracts of € 25 million , which were 
both recognized in Other opera ting expenses in the Consolidated State ments of Income.  As of March  31, 2025 , the accumulated foreign currency 
translation loss related to the disposal group recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes amounted to €159 million .

Other guarantees  112 63 
Total  194 208 
 
Siemens  Energy  issues guarantees for third -party performance, which mainly include guarantees of advance payments and performance bonds in 
consortium arrangements. In the event of a claim under the guarantees, Siemens  Energy will be required to pay up to an agreed maximum amount. 
These agreements typically have terms of up to ten years.  
In addition, Siemens  Energy issued other guarantees . Those  includ e, among others,  indemnifications in connection with the disposal of business es 
which are included in t he table above with  the maximum future payments from these obligations to the extent that future claims are not considered 
unlikely.  
Moreover, Siemens  Energy group companies act as  partner s in commercial partner ships, ha ve equity  capital contribution obligations in this 
function and are jointly and severally liable for the commercial partnerships’ liabilities.  
Besides  that, some subsidiaries abroad have significant potential tax risks that were not recognized in the statement of financial position  due to 
insufficient probability of occurrence. The potential tax risks result from a large number of individual cases involving indi rect and direct taxes. Taken 
individually, the risks are not significant. In total, they  amount to a mid three -digit  million € range . 
Siemens  Energy and Siemens  Group have agreed to initiate the process to spin off the energy business conducted by Siemens  Limited, Mumbai, 
India, into a separate legal entity with the aim of listing it on the stock exchange  in India . Shares in this separate legal entity, Siemens Energy India 
Limited, Mumbai, India, were transferred to all shareholders of Siemens Limited on April 14, 2025, based on the shareholder structure on 
April  7, 2025, so that Siemens Energy now holds a 6% share in Siemens Energy India Limited in additio n to its 6% share in Siemens Limited . 
Siemens  Energy is obligated to exchange its current 6% share in Siemens  Limited for a stake in Siemens Energy India Limited at the then applicable 
fair value in one or several trans actions. In addition, Siemens  Energy has the obligation to acquire furth er shares in Siemens Energy India Limited 
from Siemens  Group in order to achieve a total shareholding of 51%. This is expected to be completed three years after the listing of Siem ens 
Energy India Limited.

foreign currency derivatives are based on forward exchange rates  (Level 2) . Compensating effects from under lying transactions (e.g., firm 
commitments and forecast trans actions) are not taken into consider ation.  The fair value s of equity and debt instruments measured at fair value 
are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current market interest rates  (Level  3). 
The amounts presented in Level 3 include a combined call/put option over  5% of the 6% stake held overall  in Siemens Limited, Mumbai, India . The 
fair value of the option is determined based on the Black -Scholes -Model considering transaction -related conditions. The most significant value -
relevant parameter is the share price of Siemens Limited, Mumbai, India . As of March 31, 2025, a 10% increase (decrease) in the share price would 
result in an increase  (decrease ) of the negative fair value by €16 million (€ 16 million).  
At inception , the option had an initial  negative  fair value of €108  million, which was recogni zed without affecting profit or loss  and is subsequently 
amorti zed through profit or loss on a pro rata temporis basis , as no option premium was paid. In the first half of fiscal year 2025, an expense of 
€11 million is recorded  in other financial income (expense) .  
As of March 31, 2025, the negative  fair value of the option was € 70 million. The unreali zed valuation gain  of €98 million for the first half of fiscal 
year 2025 is recorded  in other financial income.

 4.2 Review Report  
To Siemens  Energy  AG, Munich  
We have reviewed the condensed interim consolidated financial statements – comprising the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive 
income, financial position, cash flows, changes in equity and notes to half -year consolidated financial statements – and the interim group 
management report of Siemens Energy AG, Munich, for the period from October 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025 that are part of the ha lf-year financial 
report according to § 115 WpHG [“Wertpapierhandelsgesetz“: “German Securities Trading Act“] . The preparation of the condensed interim 
consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” a s adopted by the EU, 
and of the interim group management report in accordance with the r equirements of the WpHG applicable to interim group management reports, 
is the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the condensed interim consolida ted financial 
statements and on the interim group managemen t report based on our review.  
We performed our review of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements and the interim group management report in  accordance 
with the German generally accepted standards for the review of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wir tschaftsprüfer (IDW) and 
in supplementary compliance with the International Standard on Review Engagements 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Informati on Performed 
by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” (ISRE 2410). Those standards require that we plan a nd perform the review so that we can preclude 
through critical evaluation, with a certain level of assurance, that the condensed interim consolidated financial statements have not been prepared, 
in material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Fina ncial Reporting” as adopted by the EU, and that the interim group management report 
has not been prepared, in material respects, in accordance with the requirements of the WpHG applicable to interim group mana gement reports. 
A review is limited primarily t o inquiries of company employees and analytical assessments and therefore does not provide the assurance attainable 
in a financial statement audit. Since, in accordance with our engagement, we have not performed a financial statement audit, we cannot issue  an 
auditor’s report . 
Based on our review, no matters have come to our attention that cause us to presume that the condensed interim consolidated f inancial statements 
have not been prepared, in material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” as adopte d by the EU, or that the interim 
group management report has not been prepared, in material respects, in accordance with the requirements of the WpHG applicab le to interim 
group management reports .

Packager Guidelines 
Section 4:  Compressor Cooling 
 
4-1. Frame Oil Cooler 
 
 All HSRC compressors come standard with a fa ctory supplied frame oil cooler to remove 
heat generated by the friction of moving parts .  It is shipped loose from the compressor 
and is the responsibility of the packager to incorporate it into the package.  The size and 
type of cooler largely depends on the amount of heat required to remove from the oil that 
absorbs this heat; this is typically referred to as "heat rejection", or "heat load".  The 
frame oil heat rejection requirements vary mainly with compressor size, speed, and 
ambient conditions.  The maximum heat load for each compressor model are listed in Table 3; these loads are based on the most severe anticipated service conditions 
(maximum speed).  The factory supplied oil co olers are sized for this condition with the 
minimum required cooling water flow rates listed in Table 3 as well; note that these flow rates are based on using water with a 140°F (60°C) inlet temperature.  The cooling water 
temperature to the cooler under any circumstance should never be above 150°F (86°C).  
To provide for the maximum service interval, the cooling water supplied to this cooler 
should be clean, with an antifreeze additive  for operation in low ambient temperature.  
The cooler water flow should be regulated so that the oil temperature is held to a 
minimum of 130°F (54°C) to prevent excessive oil pressure drops and oil sludging in the crankcase. 
 
 For applications where a factory supplied oil cooler is not furnished and the application 
involves speeds lower than the maximum, a direct ratio of the speeds (actual/maximum) 
can be used as a multiplier to determine the required (lower) heat load.  Example: A 
6HOS2 operating at 890 rpm will have a maximum heat load of (890/1200)•800 = 593 BTU/min. 
 
 
!    CAUTION  
It may be necessary to provide auxiliary heating to bring the inlet water temperature up to the required 
minimum, or to provide auxiliary cooling to lower the inlet water temperature to acceptable levels.

If an air-cooled oil cooler is installed in lieu of the standard water-cooled oil cooler, a 
thermostatic valve should be installed in the oil system to maintain the oil at or above the minimum temperature.

4-1.1. Thermostatic Control Valves  
 Temperature Settings 
  Pre-set Thermostatic Valves, set to predetermi ned temperatures at the factory, eliminates 
costly errors due to mistakes of operat ing personnel.  Operators do not have the 
capability of changing operatin g temperatures, running equipment hot or cold.  One pre-
set Thermostatic Valve must be replaced with another one to make such a change.  
Siemens Energy typically recommends a Thermo static Valve be preset to 160°F (71°C). 
 
 To extend the life of Thermostatic Valves, they should not be run for extended periods 
above 25°F (14°C) over their normal ratings.  If temperature requirements are greater, 
contact the factory for recommendations. 
 
  Operations 
 
 The operating force is generated by the expansion of a special wax which reacts to very 
small changes in temperature. 
 
 An element assembly of the Model B series with the sliding valve in the cold position is 
shown in Figure 1A.  The wax like fluid travels out the bypass (Port B as marked on the 
valve), the direction indicated by the arrow. 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The sliding valve moves up to the warm, extended position as shown in Figure 1B.  The  
Bypass is closed off by the sliding valve as it seats and the water is diverted to the outlet 
(Port C on the valve) as indicated by the arrow head at the Outlet.

 While operating, the sliding valve is usually  in the mid-position.  Rising temperature 
expands the wax material, forcing the rubber plug into a reduced diameter in the piston guide, which multiples the piston's movement by this extruding action. 
 
 The chemical composition of the wax mate rial determines the operating range of the 
valve.  The expansion of the wax generates pressure, transferring it to the piston, 
overcoming a spring force of greater than 100 lbs. (45.4 kg). 
  A simple, rugged construction is sensitive to  changes in temperature.  Valve construction 
nullifies the affects of pressure on the element.  Surges in pressure do not tend to upset 
the stability of the thermostatic valve. 
 
  Piping Diagrams 
 
 Figure 2 represents the most common piping diagram for an engine jacket water 
temperature control.  A radiator may replace a heat exchanger.  The Thermostatic Valve 
will operate in any position and may be pos itioned with regard to convenience only.

 Lubricating oil temperatures control for compressors utilizes the thermostatic valve 
installed directly in the lubricating oil line as  illustrated in Figure 3.  The oil bypasses the 
heat exchanger when cold will reach the desired operating temperature rapidly.  When 
warmer, the correct amount of oil will automatically be circulated through the heat 
exchanger to maintain the desire temperature. 
 
 The system illustrated in Figure 3A is simila r to the standard jacket water temperature 
control system with the thermostatic valve used  as a diverting valve.  In Figure 3B the 
Thermostatic Valve is used as a mixing valve, in which hot oil enters Port B and cold oil 
enters Port C.  The oil is proportionally mixed so as to exit from Port A at the appropriate 
temperature.

4-2. Cylinder Cooling   
 
 Siemens Energy Gas Field Compressor Cylinders - both gas cooled and water jacketed - 
are designed for 350°F (177°C) maximum temperature.  Our Siemens Energy Sizing 
Performance Program has warning flags basis: 
  Forced cooling is required when the following is met or exceeded…

 Water jacketed cylinders may be applied with or without circulating coolant.  If applied 
without circulating coolant, the water jackets must be vented to atmosphere.  If they can be filled with coolant (normally water/glycol mix) and vented with provision for coolant 
expansion/contraction such as a standpipe or expansion tank above the cylinders, this 
would be ideal, but is not required. 
 
 Individual consideration should be given to each compressor application when selecting a 
particular cooling method.  Cylinder design temperature should never be exceeded under any condition, but the User or Packager has the option to use a circulating water cooling 
system when jacketed cyl inders are supplied. 
 
4-2.1. Circulated Water Cooling 
  Circulating coolant through cylinder water jackets is used to remove some of the heat of 
compression and frictional heat from the cylinders and to provide uniform cylinder wall 
temperatures.  Circulating systems are most of ten used when gas discharge temperatures 
approach or exceed 300°F (149ºC) but may be used at lower temperatures if desired --- or 
when handling special gases that have problem s at high temperatures such as H2, etc. 
  All forged steel cylinders require a circulating jacket water system and water cooled 
packing system.  See Paragraph 4.3.1 for ot her cylinders requiring water cooled packing 
systems. 
 
 Coolant flow rate will vary depending upon the horsepower required by the cylinder and 
the temperature rise of the coolant.   
 
  Skid-mounted units are usually provided wi th a closed loop cooling system, using a 
water/glycol mix for coolant.  A surge tank should be included to allow for thermal expansion and makeup.  A prov ision should be made to vent the high point in the system 
(usually the aerial cooler) through the surge tank.  When filling the cooling system prior to 
starting the unit, it is important that all air is removed from the cylinder passages and 
jackets to assure complete and uniform cooling of the cylinder during operation. 
 
!    CAUTION  
 
To prevent condensation from forming on the cylinder walls and gas passages on all cylinders compressing 
wet gas (with water vapor present), the water inlet 
temperature to the cylinder should be at least 10°F (5.6ºC) above the gas suction temperature.  
 
 If the water inlet temperature is above the gas inlet temperature to the cylinder, no 
condensate will form in most cases.  Shou ld condensate form on the cylinder walls and 
gas passages, it will tend to break down the lubrication qualities of oil and cause 
excessive wear to the cylinder bore, piston rings and valves, and possibly result in valve breakage. 
 
 The minimum recommended water outlet temperature from the cylinder jackets is about 
110°F (45ºC).  This will result in optimum oil flow and distribution on the cylinder walls.  
In all cases, adequate flow must be maintained with a temperature rise across the 
cylinder of between 10°F (5.6ºC) and 20°F (11º C).

4-3. Packing Coolant   
  4.3.1  Water Cooled  
 Some packing assemblies require cooling water to remove the heat of friction generated 
within the case.  This is required on high pressure applications, long packing cases or 
boxes, and/or when there are non-lube requiremen ts (see Table 4).  The factors affecting 
the generation of heat are so varied and differ from application to application that an 
accurate prediction of the heat duty becomes ve ry difficult.  The best that can be done is 
to apply a general method of calculation, make certain assumptions, and then correct as 
necessary based on field result.  Table 5 prov ides an estimate of the coolant flow and 
respective heat duty of the packing in normal service.  It assumes a 140°F (60°C) coolant 
inlet temperature. 
 
 The coolant from the auxiliary coolant pump on the engine upstream of the thermostat on 
an engine driven unit can be used as long as the maximum temperature requirements are 
adhered to and minimum pressure is no lower than 25 PSIG (1.76 kg/cm2).  These 
temperatures and pressures need to be checked before installing the system on the entire 
range of speeds that the engine will be operatin g.  All of the tubing needs to be parallel, 
not in series; otherwise the head pressure will be too high.  There also needs to be a flow indicator at each point to ensure the flow is adequate.  If you have any questions 
regarding the setup of a cooling system, please contact the Siemens Energy Marketing or 
Engineering Department.

NOTE  
Due to the excessive pressure drop associated with 
internally cooled packings, it is recommended that the 
packing cooling system/piping be independent from any 
other water system.  An inle t coolant pressure to the 
packing case of 35 PSIG (2.46 kg/cm2) is recommended 
along with a minimum pressure drop of 15 PSIG (1.05 
kg/cm2).  The coolant must be clean, filtered, softened and 
treated to prevent corrosion or plugging of the water passages in the packing cups.

NOTE  
 
Any cylinder that can be potentially operated at the above listed pressures will be equipped with water 
cooled cases; this does not mean a water cooling 
system is required to feed the particular case.  Once 
again, it's pressure dependent, not cylinder 
dependent.  
 
 
 4-4. Precautions  
 
 • The coolant must be clean, softened and treated to prevent corrosion or plugging of the 
water passages in the packing cups. 
 
 • Do not exceed pressure or temperature design limitations.  
 • Do not allow water to freeze in the piping or cooler; use antifreeze. 
  • Turn on the cooling water before starting the unit. 
 
 • For closed system, it is recommended usi ng a 50/50 solution of  deionized water and 
glycol.

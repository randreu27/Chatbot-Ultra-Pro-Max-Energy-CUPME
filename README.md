# Chatbot Ultra Pro Max Energy

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot application specifically designed for Siemens Energy. This intelligent assistant can answer queries about Siemens Energy products, services, and documentation by leveraging a knowledge base with accurate information retrieval.

## üîç Overview

This RAG-based chatbot provides Siemens Energy with an intelligent assistant that can retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and generate accurate, contextually appropriate responses to user queries. The application is built using a modern tech stack and follows best practices for natural language processing and information retrieval.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Supports voice input for hands-free interaction with the chatbot
- **Knowledge-Grounded Responses**: Leverages RAG to provide accurate responses based on Siemens Energy documentation
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: Maintains context throughout the conversation
- **Real-time Interaction**: Offers fast response times for enhanced user experience
- **Chat History**: Maintains conversation history for reference
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web interface for easy interaction

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The application follows a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture:

- Vector Database: Stores embeddings of the knowledge base documents
- Retriever: Finds relevant documents based on the user query
- LLM Integration: Uses a language model to generate responses based on retrieved context
- Web Interface: Provides a clean interface for users to interact with the chatbot


## Technology Stack

This project leverages the following technologies:

### Backend

- **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for building APIs
- **LangChain**: Framework for developing applications powered by language models
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for efficient similarity search
- **Google Gemini**: Language model for generating human-like responses
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application

### Frontend

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core web technologies
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Web Speech API**: Browser API for voice recognition and text-to-speech

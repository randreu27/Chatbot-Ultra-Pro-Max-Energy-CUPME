Higher voltages with 
Zero GWP
Renewable energy sources are key to the 
decarbonization of the energy sector – and 
as the demand for power increases, a new 
generation of wind power plants is needed 
to handle the higher voltage created.
At the same time as increasing capacity, it’s 
essential that we achieve Zero Global 
Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmis-
sion of power as well as in its generation.
Most high-voltage electrical switchgear still 
uses SF6 gas for insulation – but this is 
24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2
and stays in the atmosphere for up to 1,000 
years. Recognizing the harmfulness of SF6
and other F-gases, the EU has legislated to 
restrict their use and allows only GWP < 1 
solutions if available.
The good news is that there is a sustainable, 
viable, future-ready alternative.
Our innovative Blue switchgear portfolio, 
including the compact 8VM3 Blue GIS ,
uses Zero fluorinated gases of any kind
and has Zero harmful impact on the
environment.
Zero SF6 – just clean air
Clean air insulation is the future of 
switchgear in wind farms and indeed the 
wider grid and is the only way to achieve 
Zero GWP and Zero toxicity.
The 8VM3 Blue GIS
combines proven 
vacuum switching technology with clean air 
insulation. It operates with Zero harmful 
greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero 
toxic decomposition products and Zero 
safety requirements during handling and 
maintenance.
The clean air used – consisting of 80% 
nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and free 
of humidity – can be released into the 
atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to 
people or the environment.
At the same time, the 8VM3 maintains the
highest standards of technical performance 
and reliability, together with low lifecycle 
costs.

Global 
Warming 
Potential (GWP)
Global warming is the rising of
the global temperature due to
emissions of greenhouse gases. 
The 8VM3 reduces the GWP
significantly by substituting SF6.
Perfect size and required performance for versatile applications 
and switchgear arrangements the 8VM3 Blue GIS
design is 
based on our long-time proven 8DN8 GIS design – but with 
higher performance at same footprint!
With its enhanced module kit 8VM3 Blue GIS
provides 
dedicated solutions where space is limited, and compactness
is required - like in renewables applications.

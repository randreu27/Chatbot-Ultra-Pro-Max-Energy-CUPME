Siemens Energy   ―  Annual Report 2020
1.10  Compensation Report
This report is based on requirements of the German 
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch), German Accounting 
Standards (Deutsche Rechnungslegungsstandards) and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Further, 
the report includes on a voluntary basis selected disclo-
sures in line with the requirements of the Second Share-
holder Rights Directive (ARUG II) dated December 12, 2019.
Dr. Jochen Eickholt and Tim Holt were appointed to the 
Executive Board as of April 1, 2020, and Dr.-Ing. Christian 
Bruch and Maria Ferraro as of May 1, 2020. From their 
appointment until September 30, 2020 (“2020 term of 
office”), the members of the Executive Board as of 
September 30, 2020, were also Managing Directors of 
Siemens Energy Management GmbH, which is the sole 
general partner of Siemens Energy Global KG, the legal 
entity that housed the Siemens Gas and Power Segment’s 
operational business (sole general partner). With the excep-
tion of Tim Holt, who also received compensation from 
Siemens Energy Inc. in the United States, the members 
received their compensation for the 2020 term of office 
from the sole general partner. In addition, a portion of 
their grants of Siemens Stock Awards at the beginning 
of fiscal 2020 is attributable to the 2020 term of office. 
They did not receive any additional compensation from 
Siemens Energy AG for their duties as members of the 
Executive Board. As of October 1, 2020, the Executive Board 
members’ compensation was transferred from the sole 
general partner to Siemens Energy AG. The members of the 
Executive Board in office from October 1, 2019, until 
March 31, 2020, were employees of Siemens AG and did 
not receive any additional compensation for their work on 
the Executive Board.
Sections 1.10.1 through 1.10.3 outline the compensation 
of members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board 
for the 2020 term of office. Section 1.10.4 gives an outlook 
on the compensation system for members of the Executive 
Board to be presented for approval at the 2021 general 
shareholders’ meeting and describes how the system has 
been applied for fiscal year 2021.1.10.1 Compensation of the members of 
the Executive Board in fiscal year 2020
Structure and components of compensation for 
fiscal year 2020
Until completion of the Spin-Off, the sole general partner 
belonged to the Siemens Group. The compensation granted 
to the sole general partner’s Managing Directors (i.e. the 
members of the Executive Board) therefore followed the 
compensation policies and practices for top executives of 
the Siemens Group. This compensation comprised fixed 
components granted independently of performance, 
including base salary, fringe benefits and retirement bene-
fits, and variable components linked to performance, 
including short-term variable compensation (bonus) and 
long-term variable compensation (Siemens Stock Awards).
Due to his responsibilities for Siemens Energy’s business in 
North America, for the 2020 term of office Tim Holt 
received a portion of his compensation from Siemens Energy, 
Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of the Company. This compensation 
comprised 70% of his base salary and bonus, as well as 
pension contributions and fringe benefits. The remaining 
30% of his base salary and bonus, as well as selected fringe 
benefits and the target value of his long-term variable 
compensation, were granted by the sole general partner.
Fixed components
Base salary
During the 2020 term of office, each member of the Exec-
utive Board received a base salary from the sole general 
partner, paid out in monthly installments. Tim Holt received 
a portion of his base salary for fiscal year 2020 from 
Siemens Energy Inc., which was paid out in biweekly 
installments.

Combined Management ReportSiemens Energy   ―  Annual Report 2020
Fringe benefits
For the 2020 term of office, members of the Executive 
Board were granted fringe benefits by the sole general 
partner. Some of the benefits granted to Tim Holt are 
attributable to Siemens Energy Inc. The value of these 
benefits amounted to between €20,359 and €43,868 per 
member of the Executive Board and included expenses for 
benefits-in-kind and other fringe benefits, such as the 
provision of a company car, allowances for insurance poli-
cies, and storage and school fees, including tax gross ups.
Pension benefits
As Managing Directors of the sole general partner, the 
members of the Executive Board were eligible to partici-
pate for the 2020 term of office in the Siemens Group’s 
defined contribution pension plan (BSAV). Under the plan, 
the Supervisory Board had the option to grant contribu-
tions to the Executive Board members’ individual pension 
accounts. In line with the decision to grant a pension 
substitute for fiscal year 2021, the Supervisory Board of 
Siemens Energy AG elected not to make contributions 
under the BSAV for fiscal year 2020, including the 2020 
term of office. Instead, members of the Executive Board 
(with the exception of Tim Holt) were granted cash 
payments. For the 2020 term of office, members of the 
Executive Board were granted per decision of the Supervi-
sory Board of Siemens Energy AG on November 9, 2020, 
cash payments amounting to €0.4 million. 
Owing to his place of employment in the United States, Tim 
Holt participates in two local retirement benefit plans 
administered by Siemens Energy Inc., a tax-optimized 
savings plan as well as a deferred compensation plan. 
Tim Holt received matching contributions from 
Siemens Energy Inc. in the amount of €2,625 under these 
retirement benfit plans during the 2020 term of office.Maria Ferraro has a pension commitment under the BSAV 
that was transferred from Siemens AG upon her appoint-
ment as Managing Director of the sole general partner. Her 
pension account is credited with an annual interest payment 
(guaranteed interest) on January 1 of each year. The guar -
anteed interest rate is currently 0.90%.  As of September 30, 
2020, the defined benefit obligation for Maria Ferraro’s 
pension commitment amounted to €0.2 million.
Variable components
Short-term variable compensation (Bonus)
The bonus for the members of the Executive Board for the 
2020 term of office is tied to the operational performance 
of the Siemens Group, and in particular the Segment Gas 
and Power. Payouts made to the members of the Executive 
Board were conditional upon attaining targets in three 
equally weighted components. These comprised two finan-
cial components as well as individual targets.
The two financial components are each measured by a 
performance indicator: the undiluted earnings per share 
(all in) of Siemens AG, measured over a three-year period, 
and the adjusted EBITA margin of Siemens’ Gas and Power 
segment. These performance indicators represent opera-
tional management metrics for the Siemens Group and are 
derived from Siemens AG’s strategy.
In addition, individual quantitative and qualitative targets 
were set for each Executive Board member.
Targets set under each component can be attained within a 
range of 0% to 200%. Target attainment can be adjusted by 
way of a “Siemens Factor,” which can have a value between 
0.75 and 1.25, resulting in a maximum payout amount of 
250% of the target amount (cap). The Siemens Factor takes 
consideration of the performance of the entire Siemens 
Group and applies universally for all Siemens Group Senior 
Managers and Top Managers worldwide. For the 2020 term 
of office, the Siemens Factor was equal to 1.

Combined Management Report
Siemens Energy   ―  Annual Report 2020
For fiscal year 2020, which is applicable for the 2020 term 
of office, the following targets and target attainment levels 
were set:
Long-term variable compensation 
(Siemens Stock Awards)
Except for the President and CEO, Dr. Christian Bruch, at the 
beginning of the fiscal year 2020, members of the Executive 
Board were granted Siemens Stock Awards (2020 Tranche) 
in connection with their functions at the time in the Siemens 
Group. A Siemens Stock Award confers the right to receive 
one Siemens share following the completion of a vesting 
period of approximately four years, depending on the degree 
to which pre-defined performance targets are attained. For 
the 2020 term of office, these targets comprised the total 
shareholder return of Siemens AG compared with the MSCI 
World Industrials, a global sector index of industrial compa-
nies, (80%) and ESG targets (20%).The number of Siemens Stock Awards granted was calcu-
lated by multiplying the target amount by the maximum 
possible target attainment of 200%. This figure is then 
divided by the price of Siemens shares at grant, defined as 
the closing price in Xetra trading, less expected dividends 
during the four-year vesting period (“grant price”). The 
four-year vesting period begins with the grant.
Upon appointment as Managing Director of the sole 
general partner from May 1, 2020, Dr. Christian Bruch 
received an unrestricted cash payment equal to the pro-rata 
target value of his contractually guaranteed Siemens Stock 
Awards grant. Maria Ferraro’s target compensation was 
adjusted upon appointment as Managing Director from Bonus 2020 term of office

May 1, 2020. Target compensation for Dr. Jochen Eickholt 
and Tim Holt was adjusted effective April 1, 2020. These 
adjustments included a higher target value for Siemens 
Stock Awards than had been granted at the beginning of 
fiscal year 2020. As compensation for this difference, Maria 
Ferraro, Dr. Jochen Eickholt and Tim Holt were granted 
unrestricted cash payments in lieu of a further grant of 
Siemens Stock Awards. The decision to grant cash payments 
instead grants of Siemens Stock Awards was made in 
consideration of the planned Spin-Off, under which all 
unvested Siemens Stock Awards were to be settled 
according to the conditions described in the following. 
The members of the Executive Board left the Siemens 
Group with completion of the Spin-Off on September 25, 
2020. In accordance with Sections 23, 125 of the German 
Transformation Act, Executive Board members’ claims 
arising from the 2020 tranche of Siemens Stock Awards 
were settled in cash, as foreseen in the relevant provisions 
of the Siemens Stock Awards program if a company is no 
longer fully consolidated in the Siemens Group. The cash 
settlement for each Siemens Stock Award is equal to the 
closing price of the Siemens share in Xetra trading on the 
day on which the Spin-Off was legally completed, less the 
value of dividends expected up until the end of the vesting 
period. Target attainment of 100% is assumed for calcu-
lating the cash settlement. Outstanding tranches of equity- 
based compensation, which include the 2020, 2019, 2018, 
and 2017 tranches of Siemens Stock Awards, as well as the 
2020, 2019, and 2018 tranches of the Siemens Share 
Matching Program, were settled in cash according to the 
aforementioned terms.
Spin-Off incentive
Prior to the Spin-Off, the members of the Executive Board 
were granted a one-time performance-based Spin-Off 
incentive as part of their role as Managing Directors of the 
sole general partner. Target amounts equaled €1,500,000 
for the President and CEO, Dr. Christian Bruch, and 
€750,000 for all other members of the Executive Board. 
Any potential payout from the Spin-Off Incentive was linked 
to the attainment of two performance conditions, the first 
relating to the financial result of the Spin-Off, and the 
second to Siemens Energy AG’s stock market value during 
the first 120 calendar days after Listing.The Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy AG confirmed in 
a resolution on November 9, 2020, that the first perfor -
mance condition was not met. As a result, no payouts will 
occur under the Spin-Off Incentive.
Total compensation
For the 2020 term of office, total compensation for all 
current members of the Executive Board amounts to 
€8.5 million according to applicable accounting provisions.
Payments and benefits granted and made for the 
2020 term of office
The following tables show individually for each Executive 
Board member the benefits granted for the 2020 term of 
office. The actual amounts paid out are reported under 
“Benefits received.”
Target compensation for short-term variable compensation 
(bonus), including the floor and cap, is reported under 
Benefits granted. The figures for individual maximum for 
the bonus reflect the possible maximum value for the 2020 
term of office – that is, 250% of the respective target 
amount. As described above, for the 2020 term of office, 
further members of the Executive Board received cash 
payments in lieu of Siemens Stock Awards grants under the 
long-term variable compensation. Minimum and maximum 
compensation for this component is thus equal to the value 
of the cash payment.
Total compensation in accordance with the applicable 
accounting standards is also reported under Benefits granted. 
Instead of the target amount for short-term variable compen-
sation (bonus), this figure includes the actual bonus and 
excludes the pension service cost.
The payments made for and entitlements arising from the 
2020 term of office are reported under Payments and 
Benefits received.

2020 term of office. Siemens Energy accounts for Tim Holt’s share-based payment plans as cash-settled plans and for Maria Ferraro and Dr. Jochen Eickholt as equity  -
settled plans since the latter are classified as Siemens AG grants. The expenses recognized for Tim Holt are not comparable due to different accounting treatment for 
share-based payment plans settled in cash.
1.10.2 Supervisory Board  
compensation
The three employees of Siemens AG who served as 
members of the Supervisory Board in the 2020 term of 
office (until September 25, 2020) did not receive any addi-
tional compensation for their work on the Supervisory 
Board. Supervisory Board members in office as of 
September 30, 2020, were appointed effective September 
26, 2020, and due to the convening of a meeting of the 
Supervisory Board on September 29, 2020, received 
compensation for this period on a pro-rata temporis basis, 
including additional compensation for work on the Audit 
Committee and the Presiding Committee. Attendance fees 
were also paid for members present for the meeting on 
September 29, 2020. The compensation regulations applicable to the Supervi-
sory Board are contained in Section 12 of the Company’s 
Articles of Association and will be presented to share-
holders for approval at the 2021 Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting. Supervisory Board compensation consists solely 
of fixed compensation and reflects the level of responsi-
bility and scope of activities required of members. The 
Chairman, Deputy Chairman, as well as the Chair and 
Members of the Presiding Committee, Audit Committee, 
Finance and Innovation Committee, and Related Party 
Transactions Committee receive additional compensation.

1.10.3 Other
The Company provides a directors’ and officers’ liability 
group insurance policy for Supervisory and Executive Board 
members and certain other employees of the Siemens  
Energy Group. The policy is taken out for one year at a time 
and renewed annually. It covers the personal liability of the 
insured individuals in cases of financial loss associated with 
their activities on behalf of the Company. With effect from 
their appointment as members of the Executive Board, they 
are subject to a mandatory deductible that complies with 
the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act.
1.10.4 Compensation system for the 
Executive Board from fiscal year 2021
The compensation system for the members of the Execu-
tive Board, which takes effect starting with fiscal year 2021, 
is established by the Supervisory Board. The Presiding 
Committee makes recommendations on the compensation 
system to the Supervisory Board. After approval by the 
Supervisory Board, the compensation system is submitted 
to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting for approval (“say on 
pay”). The system will be presented to shareholders for 
approval at Siemens Energy’s first Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting on February 10, 2021.
The review is generally based on a comparison with other 
German companies, primarily those listed in the DAX and 
MDAX German stock indices. In addition, the Supervisory 
Board takes account of the evolution of Executive Board 
compensation in relation to the compensation paid to 
Siemens Energy’s workforce in Germany. In this vertical The following core principles drive the design of Executive 
Board compensation:
• The compensation system for members of the Executive 
Board should contribute to implementing the Company’s 
strategy by setting appropriate incentives.
• Focus on successful, sustainable management of the 
Company: Executive Board members are expected to 
make a long-term commitment to the Company. For this 
reason, a substantial portion of their total compensation 
is linked to the performance of the Siemens Energy 
Group over a multi-year period.
• Compensation linked to performance: The Company’s 
size, complexity, and operational performance should be 
reflected in the Executive Board’s compensation. Excep-
tional achievements are to be adequately rewarded, 
while failing to meet targets results in an appreciable 
reduction in compensation.
Based on these principles, the Supervisory Board deter -
mines the structure, amount, and relative weighting of the 
individual components of compensation. Regular review by 
the Supervisory Board ensures that the amount of compen-
sation is appropriate. Several criteria are applied for this 
purpose:
comparison, the Supervisory Board determines the ratio of 
Executive Board compensation to the compensation paid to 
top executives (Senior Management contract group) and 
the rest of the workforce (employees covered by collective 
bargaining agreements and employees outside of those 
agreements).Criteria for assessing the appropriateness of Executive Board compensation

Structure and components of Executive Board 
compensation
Executive Board compensation comprises both non- 
performance-based and performance-based elements and 
is divided into three main components: fixed compensation 
(base salary, fringe benefits, and retirement benefits), 
short-term variable compensation and long-term equity- 
based variable compensation. Variable compensation 
comprises approximately 60% of each Executive Board 
member’s total target compensation, and a substantial 
majority of variable compensation is tied to multi-year 
performance as well as to Siemens Energy’s share price, 
thus aligning the Executive Board’s compensation with the 
Company’s long-term, sustainable development.
In general, Executive Board members’ compensation is 
defined in euros; however, the Supervisory Board may set 
compensation in local currency for Executive Board 
members whose primarily place of employment or perma-
nent residence is located outside of the Eurozone. Compen-
sation for Tim Holt, whose primary place of employment is 
in the United States, is defined in euros. For his base salary, 
target bonus, and selected benefits, these euro amounts 
are converted at the beginning of each fiscal year into U.S. 
dollars using the average exchange rate in the month of 
August according to the European Central Bank. For fiscal 
year 2021, the relevant exchange rate is €1.00 = $1.1828.
Fixed components
 
Base salary
Each member of the Executive Board receives base compen-
sation for performing his or her Executive Board duties. 
This compensation is paid in 12 monthly installments. For 
Executive Board members residing outside of Germany, the 
frequency of payments may differ in accordance with Maximum compensation for a fiscal year is defined 
according to Section 87a of the Stock Corporation Act 
(AktG) as part of the Executive Board’s compensation 
system. From fiscal year 2021, maximum compensation for 
the President and CEO amounts to €9,950,000 and for the 
remaining members of the Executive Board, €4,950,000. 
The Share Ownership Guidelines, which are a further key 
component of the compensation system, obligate Execu-
tive Board members to continuously hold Siemens Energy 
shares worth a defined multiple of their base salary and to 
acquire additional shares if the value of their holdings falls 
below the required amount.
local practice. For fiscal year 2021, annual base salary 
amounts to: 
• €1,440,000 for the President and CEO,  
Dr. Christian Bruch,
• €720,000 for Maria Ferraro and Dr. Jochen Eickholt, 
and
• €720,000 for Tim Holt  
($851,616 at €1.00 = $1.1828).
Fringe benefits
Members of the Executive Board receive fringe benefits in 
line with market practice, including, for example, the provi-
sion of a company car, contributions toward the cost of 
insurance policies, and reimbursement of expenses for 
legal and tax advice, and accommodation and moving 
expenses upon first appointment or change of primary 
location of employment, including a gross-up provided by 
the Company for any taxes due in this regard. 1 Can vary depending on value of benefits, in particular for Executive Board members whose place of employment is located outside of Germany.Target direct

Combined Management Report
Siemens Energy   ―  Annual Report 2020
Prior to the beginning of a fiscal year, the Supervisory Board 
defines for each member of the Executive Board a maximum 
monetary value of fringe benefits as a percentage of base 
salary. In the event that a member of the Executive Board 
resides outside of his or her home country, the Supervisory 
Board may define an additional amount by which the 
maximum monetary value of fringe benefits is increased in 
order to take account of additional expenses, for example, 
reimbursement for taxation in multiple countries.
For fiscal year 2021, the Supervisory Board established a 
maximum monetary value of 8% of base salary. For Tim 
Holt, additional benefits related to residence in a foreign 
country, including any tax gross ups, may be reimbursed up 
to a maximum of €400,000. The Supervisory Board also 
resolved to exclude from consideration under the maximum 
monetary value of individual contractual commitments 
that were made to Maria Ferraro and assumed by the 
Company from the sole general partner. These comprise 
reimbursement of school fees, storage costs, and tax advi-
sory services for a roughly two-year period beginning in 
May 2020.
Retirement benefits
The members of the Executive Board are eligible to partici-
pate in a pension plan, in which the Company can provide 
contributions – which are defined in terms of a fixed euro 
amount – to their individual pension accounts. Under 
consideration of market appropriateness, the Supervisory 
Board decides each year whether and in what amount to 
grant contributions. In place of a pension contribution, the 
Supervisory Board may elect to grant an unrestricted cash 
amount (pension substitute).
Entitlement Completion of age 62

the German Company Pension Law
Payment12 yearly installments; further payment options 
are available upon request: a lower number of

annual contributions for the years between the 
covered event and age 60In order to comply with local tax regulations, different 
pension rules may apply to Executive Board members 
whose place of employment is outside of Germany. 
For fiscal year 2021, in lieu of contributions to the pension 
plan, all members of the Executive Board have been granted 
a pension substitute in the following amounts:
• €500,000 for the President and CEO,  
Dr. Christian Bruch,
• €250,000 for Maria Ferraro,  
Dr. Jochen Eickholt and Tim Holt
Tim Holt participates in local retirement plans offered in the 
United States; the value of Company contributions to these 
plans on behalf of Tim Holt are credited against the pension 
substitute. 
Variable components
 
Short-term variable compensation (Bonus)
A substantial portion of the Executive Board members’ 
compensation is tied to Siemens Energy’s annual perfor -
mance (bonus). For fiscal year 2021, the annual target 
bonus amounts to
• €1,440,000 for the President and CEO,  
Dr. Christian Bruch,
• €720,000 for Maria Ferraro and Dr. Jochen Eickholt,  
and
• €720,000 for Tim Holt  
($851,616 at €1.00 = $1.1828)
The final payout amount depends on the attainment of 
financial and non-financial targets and may not exceed 
150% of the target amount (cap). Targets are divided into 
three equally weighted components: Adjusted EBITA 
margin before Special items, Return on Capital Employed 
(ROCE), and individual targets. Adjusted EBITA margin 
before Special items and ROCE reflect the short-term finan-
cial performance of the Siemens Energy Group.
70
Combined Management ReportSiemens Energy   ―  Annual Report 2020
It is intended that the target values representing 0%, 100%, 
and 150% target attainment for Adjusted EBITA margin 
before Special items and ROCE and their actual target 
attainment for fiscal year 2021, as well as the actual target 
attainment for individual targets, will be disclosed in the 
Compensation Report for fiscal year 2021.
Long-term equity-based variable compensation
At the beginning of a fiscal year, long-term equity-based 
variable compensation is granted to the members of the 
Executive Board in the form of Stock Awards. Each Stock 
Award confers the right to receive one Siemens Energy 
share after a vesting period of approximately four years, 
contingent upon attaining pre-defined performance targets. The annual target value of a Stock Awards grant is 
contractually agreed with each member of the Executive 
Board. For fiscal year 2021, the annual target amount for 
long-term equity-based variable compensation equals
• €1,920,000 for the President and CEO,  
Dr. Christian Bruch, 
• €960,000 for Maria Ferraro and Dr. Jochen Eickholt,  
and
• €960,000 for Tim Holt  
(grant in euros; no conversion to U.S. dollars)For the individual targets, prior the beginning of the respec-
tive fiscal year, the Supervisory Board selects between two 
and four targets. The following individual targets were 
selected for the fiscal year 2021 bonus:Determination of bonus payout amount

Combined Management Report
Siemens Energy   ―  Annual Report 2020
The number of stock awards to be granted is calculated by 
multiplying the maximum possible degree of target attain-
ment – 200% – by the target amount and then dividing this 
figure by the price of Siemens Energy shares on the grant 
date in Xetra trading, discounted for the value of estimated 
dividends during the four-year vesting period (Fair Market 
Value). After the end of the vesting period, members of the 
Executive Board are entitled to receive one Siemens Energy 
share for each Stock Award, whereby the final number of 
Stock Awards is determined by the attainment of the 
following targets during the performance period:
• Total Shareholder Return (TSR): TSR reflects the change 
in value of a company’s share over a defined period of 
time (in this case, four years), including any dividends 
paid during this period. Siemens Energy’s TSR is compared against the respective TSR of two sector indices of inter -
national companies, the STOXX Global 1800 Industrial 
Goods and Services (70%) and the MVIS US Oil Services 
25 (30%) or comparable successor indices.
• Earnings per Share (EPS): Siemens Energy’s earnings 
per share EPS are measured according to the average 
earnings per share from continuing operations of the 
Siemens Energy Group over the four fiscal years during 
the vesting period.
• Environmental, social & governance (ESG): Three 
non-financial targets are selected that reflect strategic 
ESG priorities for Siemens Energy. These targets are part 
of the Company’s regular reporting on sustainability.Stock Awards – Determination of target attainment and number of shares

The monetary value of the final number of Stock Awards 
may not exceed 250% of the target amount (cap). Any 
corresponding number of Stock Awards in excess will be 
forfeited without replacement.
In the event of exceptional, unforeseen events that have an 
influence on the performance criteria, the Supervisory 
Board may decide that the number of granted Stock Awards 
will be reduced after the fact, that a cash settlement of a 
limited amount to be determined will take place instead of 
a transfer of Siemens Energy shares, or that the transfer of 
Siemens Energy shares for vested Stock Awards will be 
suspended until the event ceases to influence the perfor -
mance criteria.If the employment contract of an Executive Board member 
begins during the fiscal year, an equivalent number of 
forfeitable virtual Stock Awards (Phantom Stock Awards) 
will be granted instead of Stock Awards. Unlike the Stock 
Awards, the Phantom Stock Awards will not be settled by a 
transfer of shares, but by a cash payment at the end of the 
vesting period. Remaining provisions applicable to the 
Stock Awards apply analogously.
Malus and clawback regulations for variable 
compensation 
The Supervisory Board has the option of withholding 
(malus) or reclaiming (clawback) the short-term and long-
term variable compensation in the following cases. In cases Target setting Performance measurement
TSRIf Siemens Energy AG’s TSR during the performance period:
•  Exceeds the comparison index by 20 percentage points or 
more, target attainment = 200%. 
•  Equals that of the comparison index,  
target attainment = 100%. 
•  Is 20 percentage points or more below that of the  
comparison index, target attainment = 0%.
Performance between these values is determined  
via linear interpolation.For Siemens Energy AG and the comparison indices, TSR is  
measured by comparing the average value of the month-end 
return index over the first 12 months of the performance period 
with the average month-end return index over the following  
36 months.
Once a change in TSR has been determined for 
Siemens Energy AG and the comparison indices, 
Siemens Energy AG’s TSR is compared with the respective 
index’s TSR.
EPSAt the beginning of a Stock Awards tranche, the Supervisory 
Board defines a target value for the average EPS from 
continuing operations over the four fiscal years of the vesting 
period, as well as EPS values representing 0% and 200% 
target attainment.Target attainment for the EPS component is determined by 
comparing the actual value with the target corridor set at the 
beginning of the tranche.
ESGAt the beginning of a Stock Awards tranche, the Supervisory 
Board selects up to three performance indicators for the ESG 
component. These performance indicators can be equally 
weighted, or the Supervisory Board can assign each a higher or 
lower weighting. The Supervisory Board sets targets for each 
performance indicator to be achieved by the end of the 
performance period, as well as values representing 0% and 
200% target attainment.After the end of the performance period, target attainment is 
determined for each performance indicator. Total target attain-
ment represents the weighted average of the target attainment 
for each ESG performance indicator.

of severe breaches of duty or compliance and (or) severely 
unethical behavior, the Supervisory Board may review the 
payout amount of short-term variable compensation and 
reduce it to as little as zero, depending on the extent of the 
violation, at its duty-bound exercised discretion. In such 
cases, it also has the option of allowing the long-term vari-
able compensation to be forfeited in full or in part without 
refund or replacement, depending on the severity of the 
breach.
In the event that an Executive Board member commits a 
grossly negligent or willful breach of the duty of care 
expected of a prudent and conscientious manager 
according to Section 93 para. 1 German Stock Corporation 
Act (Aktiengesetz), the Company is entitled to reclaim the 
variable remuneration components already paid out 
(bonus and (or) stock awards granted) in full or in part for 
the respective assessment period in which the breach of 
duty occurred, or to declare that Stock Awards will be 
forfeited.
If variable compensation components (bonus and (or) 
Stock Awards) based on the achievement of specific objec-
tives were unduly paid out on the basis of incorrect data, 
the Company is entitled to reclaim the difference in 
compensation resulting from the recalculation of the vari-
able compensation in comparison to the original payment 
made. The Company has to demonstrate that the under -
lying data used in the calculation of the compensation was 
incorrect and that therefore the variable compensation of 
the member of the Executive Board member was too high.
The possibilities to claim repayment of granted variable 
compensation or enforce damage claims also apply if the 
appointment or employment relationship with the member 
of the Executive Board has already ended at the time that 
this claim can be made. Claims for damages against the 
member of the Executive Board remain unaffected.
Share Ownership Guidelines
According to Siemens Energy’s Share Ownership Guide-
lines, members of the Executive Board are required to 
hold Siemens Energy shares equal in value to a multiple of 
their base salary – 300% for the President and CEO and 
200% for all other members. Members of the Executive 
Board are given a build up over a period of approximately 
four years to acquire the required number of shares. If 
changes in the share price of Siemens Energy causes the value of the acquired holdings to fall below the required 
threshold, members of the Executive Board must purchase 
additional shares.  
Commitments in connection with termination of  
an Executive Board member’s term of office
The compensation system also governs the amount of 
compensation paid to an Executive Board member when 
his or her term of office on the Executive Board is termi-
nated early. When a member leaves office, his or her short-
term variable compensation (bonus) is calculated on a pro 
rata basis after the end of the fiscal year and is granted on 
the regular payout date.
If an employment contract is terminated, Stock Awards are 
governed by the following rules: 
• Stock Awards for which the vesting period has not yet 
ended will be forfeited without refund or replacement if 
the employment contract is not renewed at the end of a 
term of office at the Executive Board member’s request 
or if there is serious cause that entitles the Company to 
revoke the member’s appointment or terminate his or 
her employment contract
• Stock Awards will not be forfeited, however, if the employ -
ment contract is terminated by mutual agreement at the 
Company’s request, in the event of death or in connection 
with a Spin-Off, but will instead be settled with a cash 
payment. If the termination is in connection with retire-
ment, invalidity or a transfer to a different company 
within the group, Stock Awards remain unaffected.
• Stock Awards granted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
in which the Executive Board member leaves office will 
be calculated and reduced on a pro rata basis. When an 
Executive Board member leaves the Company, any 
existing Stock Awards will only be transferred at their 
due date.
The following rules also apply when an Executive Board 
member leaves office and vary depending on the reason 
for contract termination:
• Termination due to regular expiry of the term of office  
No severance payments or special pension contributions 
or pension substitutes are made.
74
Combined Management ReportSiemens Energy   ―  Annual Report 2020
• Termination by mutual agreement without cause  
In the event of early mutual termination of membership 
on the Executive Board without cause, Executive Board 
contracts provide for a compensatory payment:

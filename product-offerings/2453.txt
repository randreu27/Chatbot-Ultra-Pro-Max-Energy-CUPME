Global Vacuum Pressure 
Impregnation (GVPI)
Applicable for all generator products up to 22 kV
Siemens Energy MICALASTIC®© 2021 Siemens Energy Page 2GVPI track record
• > 1,700 stator windings in GVPI technology in turbine 
generators with a total output of > 240,000 MVA
• > 25,5 million operating hours and more than 322,000 
start / stop cycles at a reliability rate exceeding 99.9%
• Fleet leaders with > 150,000 operating hours (OH) and 
3,320 start / stop cyclesThe MICALASTIC® insulation  
system developed by Siemens 
Energy uses Global Vacuum Pressure 
Impregnation technology to provide 
excellent electrical, mechanical  
and thermal properties. Our GVPI 
system has a proven track record  
of industry- leading reliability since 
1988.
GVPI design benefits
• Designed for more than 30 years of operation (electrical 
lifetime > 100 years)
• Complies with all international standards (EN, IEC, IEEE, 
KEMA, API, etc.)
• Excellent and tight consolidation with axial flexibility 
allows for thermal  expansion
• Soft coils enable lower stress installation and assembly 
process
• Low shrinkage insulation system and patented Outer 
Corona Protection (OCP)-System reduce vibration spark -
ing and slot dischargeKey Benefits
•  > 99.9% reliability
• > 30 years operation life
• Industry-leading shrinkage control
• Allows for axial thermal expansion
• Robust coil and winding assembly
• Reduces or eliminates vibration sparking  
and slot discharge
• No re-wedging or re-tightening of  
end winding  structure
• No re-tightening of stator core

• Three-layer patented external mica protection system 
in slot area: designed for permanent electrical contact 
with grounded stator core
• Mica tape insulation across entire length of the stator 
bars: continuous computer- automated and controlled 
application 
• Semiconducting mica protection tapes at the slot 
ends:  designed for discharge-free voltage depression at 
slot endsGVPI manufacturing excellence
Wound stator core assembly
• Pre-pressing of insulation before placement in the slot 
enables stress-relieved coil assembly 
• Soft coils enable low stress assembly in the end winding 
region
• Significantly reduced stress on the coil insulation during 
installation of the bracing in the end winding regionStator bar layering
GVPI process
• Drying of the pre-heated wound core in the GVPI tank  
by evacuation prior to impregnation process
• Fully automated computer-controlled and monitored 
impregnation process to maintain uniform product 
quality
• Proprietary curing and cool down process ensures manu -
facturing robustness and highest level of quality
• Quality assurance in all phases of production with   
 numerous mechanical and electrical tests1 Copper strand: insulated, stranded copper, 
 roebelled for performance benefits
2 Inner Corona Protection (ICP) system:  provides an 
equipotential sleeve to evenly distribute electrical 
field strength across the main insulation
3 Main insulation: high performance class F Mica-
lastic® insulation system with high-purity epoxy and 
discharge-resistant mica paper
4 Outer Corona Protection (OCP) system:  ensures 
constant electrical contact of the main insulation

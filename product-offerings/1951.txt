International Terms and Conditions  for Project Business  
1. General  
1.1 The scope, quantity, quality, functionality and technical specifications of any goods, equipment, documentation, 
software, work or services , including Digital Services,  to be provided by Siemens Energy (collectively referred to 
as "Works ") are exclusively defined as the case may be either in the order confirmation issued by Siemens 
Energy or the Contract signed by the Customer and Siemens Energy.  
 
1.2 “Digital Service ” or “ Digital Services ” shall mean any and all deliveries and services as further described in this 
Contract and the respective Addenda hereto. Digital Services may be comprised of hardware parts, software 
and/or Applications. “Application” shall mean the (i) software, (ii) web  pages, (iii) connectivity, (iv) infrastructure 
and (v) hardware being located outside of Customer ’s site, all of them as used by Siemens Energy in order to 
provide the Digital Services.  
 
1.3 The offer letter from Siemens Energy together with these terms and conditions and those other documents ex-
pressly identified in the offer letter as forming part of the contract shall together constitute the entire agreement 
between the parties (the " Contract "). Any terms and conditions of the Customer shall apply only where expressly 
accepted in writing by Siemens Energy.  
 
1.4 Siemens Energy is entitled to provide the Works  via a secure remote access (“ Remote Services ”). Remote 
Service means Siemens Energy Remote Service, i.e. an online connection between Siemens Energy and the 
relevant Work s at the Customer’s site allowing for remote services e.g. installation of Updates, Bug Fix and 
Patches as well as monitoring and analysis.  
 
The Customer shall verify that the security concept for the remote access proposed by Siemens Energy (see 
Common Remote Service Platform cRSP – security concept in its current version) is compatible with the technical 
capability of the Customer and the Cus tomer’s safety, cyber security and other requirements. The Customer 
remains at all times responsible for the safety of humans, machines, and the processed  objects.  
 
The Customer shall grant Siemens Energy access to the processed  objects via remote access. If contractually 
agreed with the Customer, the Customer shall activate and accept each remote access of Siemens Energy.  
 
The Customer shall provide an internet connection, which meets the technical requirements for a remote connec-
tion. The costs for such internet connection shall be borne by the Customer.  
 
Siemens Energy is entitled to modify or amend the existing security concept, so long as the performance of Works  
via remote access is not compromised. Prior to implementing an amended security concept, Siemens Energy will 
inform the Customer of the amended security concept. In the event the implementation is contrary to reasonable 
interests of the Customer, the Cust omer shall give written notice to Siemens Energy within 4 weeks after receipt 
of the notice of the intended change in concept. In the event Siem ens Energy and the Customer are unable to 
agree on the security concept, the Customer is entitled to terminate the Contract in respect of such Works that 
include Remote Services. In any event Siemens Energy may implement the amended security concept 8 week s 
after notifying the Customer.  
 
2. Rights of Use  
2.1 Except as expressly otherwise agreed in this Contract all intellectual and industrial property rights in the Works, 
in all documents provided by Siemens Energy in connection with this Contract (the “ Documents ”) and in all 
software, hardware, know how (“ IPR”), and other things provided with or as part of the Works and the Documents 
shall be the exclusive property of and vest in Siemens Energy. The Customer shall not reverse engineer, decom-
pile, or reproduce the Works or parts thereof and shall ensure that th ird parties will not reverse engineer, decom-
pile or reproduce the Works or parts thereof in each case to the extent mandatory law does not prohibit such

in object code without source codes. The license hereunder only grants the non -exclusive right to use the software 
as described in the Applicable License Conditions or, if there are no applicable license terms, for the purpose of 
operation and routine main tenance of the Works.  
 
2.4 The Works may include third party software. Insofar as specific license terms of the third -party licensor (e.g. 
EULA) apply, Siemens Energy will provide such license terms together with the Works. The Customer shall com-
ply with such third -party license terms.  These alone apply to the liability of the respective licensor towards the 
Customer.  
 
2.5 Insofar as the software contains Open Source Software (“ OSS ”), Siemens Energy will provide the applicable OSS 
license terms together with the Works. The OSS license terms shall prevail over this Contract. Details regarding 
any third -party software and OSS contained in the Works are available in the software docume ntation (e.g. RE-
ADME_OSS).  
 
2.6 Insofar as Open Source Software is included in the Works, such Open Source Software is listed in the Re-
adme_OSS file of the Software. The Customer is entitled to use the Open Source Software in accordance with 
the respective applicable license conditions of the Open Sourc e Software, which shall prevail over this Contract. 
The Open Source Software license conditions shall have priority also in relation to the proprietary Siemens Energy 
components insofar as the Open Source Software license conditions grant the Customer cert ain rights of use on 
the basis of the connection of OSS components with proprietary Siemens Energy components. Siemens Energy 
shall make available to the Customer, at the request of the Customer, the Open Source Software source code in 
return for payment o f a fee to compensate for expenses insofar as the license conditions of the Open Source 
Software require such release of the source code.

3.2 Unless expressly stated otherwise, if Siemens Energy undertakes any erection, assembly, installation, commis-
sioning or testing of the Works or a part of the Works outside Siemens Energy’s own premises (“ Works on Site ”), 
the Customer shall bear all incidental costs, such as travel expenses, daily allowances, in addition to the Contract 
Price.  
 
3.3 The Contract Price is exclusive of any indirect taxes (such as property, license, sales, use, value added or similar 
tax) and/or any duties, customs or public charges related to the Contract. The Customer agrees to pay or to 
reimburse Siemens Energy for an y taxes, customs, duties or other public charges levied on Siemens Energy in 
relation to the Works. All payments shall be made to Siemens Energy’s bank account without deduction (e.g. 
deduction of withholding tax) within 30 days after issuance of the invoi ce. If the Customer is required to make a 
deduction by law, the sum payable shall be increased so that Siemens Energy receives a net amount equal to 
the amount it would have received without such deduction. The Customer shall provide to Siemens Energy tax 
receipts from the relevant tax authorities in connection with the payments in due course.  
 
3.4 Without prejudice to any other rights it may have, Siemens Energy may charge interest at 9 percentage points

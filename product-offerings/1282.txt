Update to the Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance 
Code pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act issued by the 
Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy AG  
 
The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board last issued a Declaration of Conformity 
pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in November 2020. 
That declaration is updated as follows:   
According to recommendation C.10 Sentence 1 of t he German Corporate  
Governance Code (version dated December 16, 2019), the Chairman of the Super-
visory Board and the Chairman of the committee that addresses Management Board 
remuneration are to be independent from the Company and the Executive Board. A 
deviation from this recommendation was disclosed in the Declaration of Conformity 
in November 2020.  
 
In the assessment of the Supervisory Board, Mr. Joe Kaeser, the Chairman of the 
Supervisory Board and Chairman of the Presiding Committee (which addresses t he 
issue of remuneration), will be considered independent once he has left the Managing 
Board of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft on February 3, 2021. In the assessment  of the 
Supervisory Board, neither his former capacity as a member of the Managing Board 
and President and Chief Executive Officer of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, nor the 
business relationships between the companies in the Siemens Energy Group on the 
one hand and the companies in the Siemens Group on the other, constitute a per-
sonal or business rel ationship that may cause a substantial – and not merely tempo-
rary – conflict of interest  within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance 
Code . 
Otherwise , the Declaration of Conformity from November 2020 remains unchanged.

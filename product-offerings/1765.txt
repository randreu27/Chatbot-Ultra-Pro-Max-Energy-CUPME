Continued investment and development in the SGT-A05 to 
meet the rapidly changing customer environment
At Siemens Energy we understand the rapidly changing 
nature of today’s industrial and commercial environment, in 
which market requirements and operating conditions can 
vary significantly – and often unpredictably. So we design 
our products and services to help ensure Siemens Energy 
customers maintain performance and increase profitability 
throughout the life of their power generation project.
SGT-A05 Aeroderivative Gas Turbine variants
The SGT-A05 gas turbine variants produce electrical power 
output between 4 and 5.8 MW for applications such as base 
load, combined heat and power, mobile power and 
emergency power.
SGT-A05 variants are fulfilling the requirements of a wide 
spectrum of applications in terms of efficiency, reliability, 
flexibility and environmental compatibility.
SGT-A05 gas turbine variants offer low life-cycle costs and 
an excellent return on investment.Reducing exhaust emission for our customers and 
their communities
SGT-A05 is offered with either standard rich burn or 
advanced lean-burn combustion technology available with 
the Dry Low Emission (DLE) system. 
The DLE system achieves emission levels better than 25 
vppm NOx and 50 vppm CO. The DLE System has achieved 
single digit NOx.*
50% turndown capability with emission compliance is 
available on the DLE system. Siemens Energy continues to 
invest in further enhancing the emission and turndown 
capabilities of the SGT-A05 gas turbine.
Water and steam injection diluent options are available for 
emissions reduction with standard rich burn combustion 
configurations.

Decarbonization 
@ Siemens Energy
The world is hungry for energy, and climate change calls for 
lower emissions. Our customers need innovative solutions 
to succeed as carbon neutrality will drive significant 
changes in the market. We have a solution to navigate 
these changes. 
Gas turbines remain an important element in the power 
generation as electrification trends toward full 
decarbonization and the hydrogen economy start to unfold. 
SGT-A05 gas turbines can run on a wide range of fossil fuels 
today as we prepare to run on carbon-neutral fuels when 
needed. Please contact us to find out how.
Reliability, availability, and grid stability will continue to be 
important features in an energy environment with 
increased penetration of renewable energy. The fast-
starting feature of the SGT-A05 gas turbines, combined 
with carbon neutral fuels, makes this equipment the ideal 
future-proof investment for projects such as data centers, 
peaking and baseload units. The SGT-A05 will be capable of 
handling the hydrogen blended into existing natural gas 
infrastructure or run as a standalone fuel. 
Carbon neutral fuels are one of the most important future 
technologies to reduce greenhouse gases and drive climate 
change, especially in industrial applications. The SGT-A05 
gas turbine technology enables our customers to supply 
energy sustainably, reliably, and economically.Decarbonization impact
• Reduction in CO₂ footprint with carbon 
neutral fuels, such as hydrogen
• Utilization of hydrogen from industry 
by-product (e.g., petrochemical)
More customer benefits
• Upgrading Siemens Energy gas turbines 
to carbon neutral fuel capability protects 
existing assets and future investments for 
a fully decarbonized world
• Low NOx emissions through DLE or WLE 
technology (dry/wet low emission)
Decarbonizing energy one step at a time
The SGT-A05 operational and fuel flexibility enables the 
transition to reliable and environmentally sustainable 
energy. Therefore, owners of existing and new SGT-A05 gas 
turbine power plants can be confident of their plants’ roles 
in supporting the future energy transition.
Applicable for baseload, back-up and combined heat and 
power generation, the SGT-A05 Hydrogen conversions will 
feature:
• Minimal hardware changes at lower H2 blends
• Significant CO2 reductions at higher H2 blends 
• No power derate all the way up to 100% H2.“In answering the question of how we can meet the 
world’s growing energy needs while protecting the 
climate, hydrogen will be an important lever. It allows to 
decarbonize different sectors and to transport or store 
renewable energy. At Siemens Energy, we will continue 
to drive the development of a hydrogen economy.”
Christian Bruch, CEO Siemens Energy
No power reduction,  
even at 100% H2.
Currently, SGT-A05 is capable of operating on 
30% vol. hydrogen with minimal hardware 
changes on DLE and WLE systems.SGT-A05 Aeroderivative Gas Turbine

As these technologies differ from traditional synchronous generators in that they are not physically synchronized to the grid, new challenges arise. Grid-forming is the answer, increasing grid stability and security of supply by providing flexible and resilient solutions to grid disturbances.​ Arrange a consultation Discover our latest white paper Download here Rapidly changing grid dynamics create new challenges regarding voltage and frequency control​​ The ever-changing grid is currently shifting towards distributed generation and the implementation of a growing number of inverter-based power plants, including wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) arrays and batteries. Due to the increasing number of installations, an increase in the occurrence of interaction problems can be expected. It also leads to a reduction in synchronous machines, which weakens the grid and increases the risk of transient voltage instability and converter instability in grid-following systems. Better controls and parameter tuning can reduce these risks, but there is a limit to how far they can go. In addition, the restoration of meshed networks is becoming increasingly important. This leads to the following challenges:​ Staying below allowed voltage fluctuations​ Power system equipment and loads require regulated voltage for proper operation. ​ Staying below critical frequency levels​ Frequency drift caused by fluctuations in generation or load must be mitigated. ​ Lack of inertia​ All generation resources must synchronize and remain synchronized through network disturbances.​ Emergency reaction​ System restoration, process of black starting and restoring the power system following a major outage.​ Grid-forming vs. grid-following​ Most power electronic systems today use grid-following (GFL) inverter controls. Due to their widespread use and growing installed capacity, it is important to understand the characteristics, dynamic behavior and potential contribution to grid reliability of these inverters. Both grid-forming and grid-following controls aim to supply active and reactive power to the grid. However, their behavior during and after system disturbances differs.​ Grid-forming The controller maintains an internal voltage phasor in the transient time frame, with the magnitude and frequency set locally at each inverter​. It can operate in an electrical island or synchronize with an external grid. Allows to respond instantly to changes in the phase angle of the external system, providing additional active and reactive power as needed.​ Grid-following​ The controller assumes that the well-defined grid voltage is tightly controlled by other generators. ​ Needs a fast-acting synchronizing function, typically a phase-locked loop, which measures the grids voltage angle at the connection point​. If the controller fails to accurately and quickly track the external voltage, it won't maintain a controlled, stable output.​ Solutions with grid-forming capabilities​ Grid-forming assets Portfolio element TSO description HVDC PLUS® HVDC converter stations SVC PLUS FS® E-STATCOM SVC PLUS® STATCOM Topology Double star / B6 Double star / B6 + supercapacitors Delta High-level description Symmetric monopole & bipole solutions for a broad range of power transmission requirements Superior scalability for energy storage capabilities Flexible arrangement and scalability of SVC PLUS® branches Grid-forming capabilities Inherent and instantaneous response to voltage disturbances in the AC grid Inherent and instantaneous response to voltage disturbances in the AC grid Inherent and instantaneous response to voltage disturbances in the AC grid Stabilizing the AC grid voltage also at very low short-circuit ratio Stabilizing the AC grid voltage also at very low short-circuit ratio Stabilizing the AC grid voltage also at very low short-circuit ratio Supporting renewable energy sources and inverter based ressources (IBRs) Supporting renewable energy sources and inverter based ressources (IBRs) Supporting renewable energy sources and inverter based ressources (IBRs) Inertial response to frequency disturbances in the AC grid Instantaneous response to frequency disturbances in the AC grid -

Dead Tank Circuit Breakers 72.5-145 kV       
F-gas free product for CO2 neutral grids
Vacuum technology – Game 
changing technology for F-gas free high-voltage power grids
Siemens Energy recognizes climate change as a challenge 
that is changing the world. SF6, the insulating gas utilized in 
most modern gas insulated equipment, boasts a global 
warming potential of approximately 23,500 times that of CO2. 
In a revolutionary development for high-voltage Siemens 
Energy is going “Blue”. Siemens Energy developed a vacuum 
technology with clean air insulation that is capable of reliable 
short-circuit interruption at voltage levels from 72.5-145 kV 
with zero CO2 emissions over the lifetime of the equipment. 
This solution provides the best performance addressing the highest environmental standards in place now and ones in 
the future.
The members of our Blue circuit breaker family meet the 
same high-quality standards as our SF
6 portfolio:
• Reliable making and breaking capabilities
• High-performance and maintenance-free operating  
mechanism
• Highest availability and length of operation
Moreover, the vacuum technology promotes several features 
that are superior to traditional circuit breakers:
• 30 full short-circuit current interruptions
• 10,000 rated current interruptions
• Optional 2-cycle current interruption
• Full performance down to -60°C ambient temperature
• Maintenance-free interrupter unit during its lifetime
Instead of SF6 , our new generation of Blue high-voltage 
breakers use clean air for insulation consisting of 80 percent 
nitrogen and 20 percent oxygen. This insulation medium can 
be released into the atmosphere with zero harmful effects to 
people, environment and no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Environmental Health and Safety (EHS)
• Nontoxic insulation gas, no toxic decomposition 
products
• Greenhouse- and F-gas free insulation
• No special safety measures required
Efficiency
• No F-gas regulated – reporting, training, frequent 
density checks
• Minimized effort for gas handling during operation 
and end of life (no gas recycling)
Performance
• High number of short-circuit and rated current interruptions
• Two-cycle current interruption
Reliability
• More than 40 years of experience in medium-voltage vacuum switching technology – more than 10 years 
in high-voltage applications
• Perfect for low-temperature applications without 
heating systems

All values in accordance with IEEE/ANSI; other values on request.The world’s most environmentally 
friendly dead tank breaker
CO2 neutrality can only be achieved with a GWP of ZERO!  
Clean air insulation combined with vacuum technology is the 
only way to achieve this goal. It operates completely without 
harmful greenhouse gases nor any other hazardous F-gas and 
thereby goes well beyond the common health and safety 
standards.
The Blue product line design leverages our proven modular 
platform, 150 years of industry experience and has an 11-year successful track record of  implementing vacuum outdoor 
high voltage breaker applications with more than 400 devices 
in operation.
Siemens Energy 3AV1 DT Blue circuit breakers are tested in 
accordance with IEEE/ANSI standards. 
The Siemens Energy 3AV1 Blue circuit breakers are another 
solid step to support our customers in achieving their goals of 
an environmentally friendly and resource-efficient, power 
generation.
Let‘s make tomorrow different today.

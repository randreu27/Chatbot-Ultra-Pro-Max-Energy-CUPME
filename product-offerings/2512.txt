The global challenge is now intensified by 
the current scenario where the production 
capacity for power transformers is at its 
brink, limiting the ability to quickly replace 
or augment existing units to meet growing 
demand or to replace failing units prompt -
ly. This scenario puts pressure on utilities 
to extend the life of existing transformers 
through meticulous maintenance while si -
multaneously addressing the challenges of 
doing so in an environmentally sustainable 
and cost-effective manner. In this way, the 
repair of power transformers presents as 
a reliable option for mitigating these chal -
lenges. Repairs can be executed either in a 
dedicated factory setting or directly on-site, 
depending on the specific requirements and 
conditions. Siemens Energy, with its com -
prehensive expertise, is equipped to carry 
out these complex repair tasks in both en -
vironments, ensuring that transformers can 
continue to operate efficiently and reliably.
V ast distances or poor transportation con -
nections sometimes make it necessary to 
perform repairs on-site. Siemens Energy 
has developed a mobile repair solution for 
this purpose. The container-sized mod -
ule provides all the necessary equipment 
for analyzing a transformer’ s condition, 
improving performance, and conducting 
electrical tests.
When is on-site repair your 
best option?
The on-site repair solution emerges as the 
optimal choice for minimizing operation -outages and customer dissatisfaction. 
Additionally, as critical components of 
the electrical grid, power transformers 
command multi-million-dollar invest -
ment costs, reflecting their strategic 
importance and technological sophis -
tication. Consequently, there is a strong 
emphasis on extending their operation -
al lifespan as much as possible through 
rigorous maintenance schedules and 
careful monitoring to maximize the re -
turn on this substantial investment and 
ensure grid reliability.
When a power transformer fails, the 
main operational challenge is the result -
ing downtime, which can cause signif -
icant bottlenecks in electricity supply. 
This downtime not only affects consumer  
satisfaction but also imposes economic 
strains on industries that rely on a con -
stant power supply.
Extending the life of existing transform -
ers through repairs significantly reduces 
the demand for resources and benefits 
the environment by minimizing resource 
extraction and waste. This approach also 
promotes innovation in repair tech -
niques and sustainability practices with -
in the power industry.Empowering reliability: The 
vital role and maintenance of 
power transformers
Power transformers serve as critical nodes 
within electrical systems, enabling the ef -
ficient transmission and distribution of 
electricity by converting voltage levels to 
suit different stages of the electrical grid. 
By stepping up voltage for long-distance 
transmission to minimize energy loss and 
stepping it down for safe local distribution 
and use, they enhance energy efficiency, 
ensure the safety of electrical appliances, 
and facilitate the integration of diverse 
power sources. Their role underpins the 
reliability, scalability, and economic via -
bility of electrical systems, making them 
indispensable for maintaining continu -
ous and adaptable power supply across 
various sectors of modern society. That 
is why it is so important to keep this asset 
running smoothly.
Power transformers are very reliable 
assets. Depending on the type of trans -
former, their average failure rates are 
between 0.5% and 1% per year [1]. How -
ever, these rates can spike due to aging 
infrastructure, inadequate maintenance, 
or overloading, leading to unplanned al disruption, avoiding the high costs and 
hazards of transportation, and addressing 
the challenges of remote locations, urgent 
response times, environmental concerns, 
and regulatory compliance, all of which 
are paramount. 
• Minimized downtime:  On-site repairs 
can often be completed more quickly 
than factory repairs since transporta -
tion time is eliminated. This is crucial 
for facilities where downtime directly 
impacts production and revenue.
• Minimized transportation expenses 
and risks:  On-site repairs significantly 
reduce transportation expenses and en -
sure the safe handling of large or heavy 
transformers, eliminating the potential 
for further damage during transit.
• Operational constraints:  In some 
industries, such as continuous man -
ufacturing processes or critical in -
frastructure (e.g., hospitals, data 
centers), the transformer may be too 
critical to take offline for extended 
periods. Furthermore, the loss of 
redundancy (if applicable) will be 
minimized. On-site repair allows for 
quicker turnaround.• Logistical challenges:  For transform -
ers installed in remote or difficult-to-ac -
cess locations, the logistical challenges 
and costs of transportation might make 
on-site repair the only feasible option.
• Immediate response:  On-site repair 
teams can often respond quickly to 
emergencies, minimizing the impact 
of transformer failure on operations 
and safety.
• Environmental considerations:  Re -
moving a transformer, especially one 
containing oil, can pose environmental 
risks; additionally, heavy transporta -
tion contributes significantly to CO2 
emissions.
• Regulatory and compliance issues: 
In some cases, transporting the trans -
former could involve regulatory com -
plexities due to the materials or com -
ponents involved.On-site service features

Environmental benefits of  
on-site repair
On-site repair solutions, such as those of -
fered by Siemens Energy, provide signifi -
cant environmental benefits by conserving 
resources through the use of fewer new 
materials and components. This approach 
also leads to a substantial reduction in 
waste; by repairing what already exists, the 
cycle of discarding old transformers and 
manufacturing new ones is interrupted. 
The carbon footprint of on-site repairs is 
generally much smaller compared to the 
full life cycle of manufacturing, transport -
ing, and installing new transformers, as the 
logistics involved have a significant envi -
ronmental impact through emissions. Ad -
ditionally, by extending the operational life 
of a transformer, on-site repair solutions 
reduce the need for frequent replacements, 
thereby reducing the environmental im -through additives; stationary drying with 
DRY ; long-term regeneration and drying 
with CLEAN.
- Active part repair: Active part repair is a 
specialized service targeting the restoration 
of the most crucial components within a 
transformer. Siemens Energy’ s expert tech -
nicians address issues such as damaged 
windings, core lamination problems, in -
sulation deterioration, and any other com -
ponent failures that can compromise the 
transformer’ s functionality and efficiency. 
- Active part drying: The on-site meth -
ods, such as hot oil spray and vapor phase 
in the tank, ensure thorough moisture 
elimination using heat applications, while  
DRY provides an ongoing, in-service  
drying solution, leveraging  adsorbent 
materials to sustain optimal moisture lev -
els, with minimal disruption.
- External parts refurbishment: From 
modernizing control panels and renew -- Condition Assessment: Our com -
prehensive diagnostic modules assess the 
transformer condition, providing transpar -
ent and objective evaluations for informed  
decision-making. With three levels of as -
sessment, including inspection, diagnos -
tics, and high voltage testing, DIAG offers 
a thorough analysis of transformer health, 
identifying risks and prioritizing mainte -
nance actions. Our experienced service 
professionals provide detailed test reports 
with recommended actions.
- Oil treatment: T ransformer oils di -
rectly interact with the paper insulation of 
the windings which in turn limits the life -
time of a transformer if the paper condi -
tion gets poor due to the impact of the oil 
condition. Siemens Energy offers a wide 
range of services for analyzing, cleaning, 
and regenerating the transformer oil: gas 
chromatography and physiochemical 
analysis; F2AL determination; filtration; 
filling in a vacuum; regeneration with REG  
and degasification; inhibition/passivation pact associated with the production and 
disposal of electrical equipment. 
For instance, when service is required in 
Singapore, mobilizing personnel locally, 
say from Jakarta to Singapore and back, 
results in approximately 0.2 tons of CO2 
[2] emissions per person. In contrast, 
international mobilization from Frank -
furt to Singapore and back generates sig -
nificantly higher emissions, around 2.8 
tons of CO2 [2] per person. Therefore, 
Siemens Energy, with its extensive glob -
al presence, is strategically positioned to 
minimize environmental impacts. The 
company can leverage its widespread lo -
cal expertise, reducing the necessity for 
long-distance travel. Additionally, the use 
of advanced virtual tools for operations 
and troubleshooting further lessens the 
carbon footprint. Investing in the training 
and development of local teams across 
its global locations is important. This not 
only reduces travel-related emissions but 
also improves the speed and efficiency of 
on-site transformer services. 
Revitalizing hydroelectric 
power generation: A case 
study in transformer uprating 
and refurbishment
A client from a remote location in Bra -
zil enhanced their hydroelectric plant’ s 
efficiency by refurbishing and uprating 
five step-up transformers from 112 MV A 
to 134.4 MV A. The complex project in -
volved redesigning HV and LV windings, 
adapting connections, reformulating the 
insulation system, and resizing the cool -
ing system. A new oil preservation system 
and modern control panel were also in -
stalled. The execution was done in stages 
under controlled conditions, including a specialized air-conditioned tent for hu -
midity control. 
Old insulating oil was disposed of, and 
the transformer’ s active parts were re -
moved, inspected, and reassembled with 
new components. An innovative vapor 
phase in the tank process dried the active 
parts, followed by comprehensive testing 
to ensure reliability. This strategic refur -
bishment increased the transformers’ 
power and longevity, improved system 
reliability , and provided sustainable 
maintenance for the electrical infra -
structure.
The project achieved continuous power 
generation with minimal downtime, 
offered cost savings by upgrading exist -
ing units instead of full replacements and 
minimizing environmental impact. 
With modernized components and con -
trol systems, operational efficiency and 
resilience to future grid demands were 
significantly enhanced, lowering the 
risk of failures and extending the 
lifespan of the transformers. The pro-
ject has thus enhanced the operational 
flexibility of the electrical grid, better 
equipping it to adapt to fluctuating pow -
er demands and the changing landscape 
of power generation, marked by the in -
tegration of renewable energy and evolv -
ing consumer behaviors.Elevating power transformer

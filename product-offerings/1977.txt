Introduction  
 
In December of 2015 in support of the transition from Rolls Royce to Siemens ownership our logistic model was 
changed to introduce K&N as ou r preferred service provider for shipments from the UK to Canada.  Along with 
supporting infrastructure from UPS and TNT for local shipments into the UK cross -dock.  The initial setup was using 
the K&N Heathrow facility as the cross dock for outbound shipments to Canada.  After careful  consideration and 
review of the past three mont hs of operations it has been determined that the Siemens Canada Energy business 
would be better served by moving the K&N cross dock operations to their Birmingham facility.   
 
This change will take effect the week of March 21st 2016.  We will make the necessary changes to the TNT and UPS 
shipping accounts which are used to get the shipments to the K&N cross dock.  Please take note of this change and 
modify any labeling or documentation referencing the K&N cross dock location.

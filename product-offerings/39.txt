Power transmission system project Gralha Azul in Brazil Main features Voltage range from 36 kV to 800 kV Rated current up to 5000 A (80 kA – 1 s) Short-circuit currents are maximum values and maybe only valid for 1s – needs to be verified for specific application Durable materials for use in strong seismic activity Suitable for indoor and outdoor use Switching capacity requirements, such as the commutating currents, electromagnetic and/or electrostatic couplings (also with values above and beyond the IEC) Advantages Maintenance-free contact system without spring elements Outstanding price-performance ratio Operational under all severe climatic conditions, including in coastal regions and areas with dramatic temperature differences, high risk of ice formation or strong seismic activity Type-tested according to IEC 62271-102 Quality control system certified according to DIN EN ISO 9001 Delivery of completely routine-tested and pre-adjusted assemblies simplifies setup and commissioning Life-time technical support and service on short notice Our disconnectors and earthing switches variations 3DN1 center break disconnectors 3DN2 double side break disconnectors 3DN3 pantograph disconnectors 3DN4 vertical break disconnectors The center break is the most frequently used disconnector type worldwide. Its design is characterized by two rotating insulators that open and close the contacts in a sideways motion. Main features and advantages: Design with two rotating insulators mounted on an integrated base frame The current path opening to the side creates a bigger phase distance in parallel arrangements than with other disconnector types Convenient design allows for versatile and customized applications, e.g. in parallel, diagonal or in-line arrangements Integrated base frame can be easily and flexibly adapted to the supporting structure Available in various colors Sophisticated contact system ensures long service life and requires no maintenance effort Extended RIV limits for each voltage level reduce magnetic interference for increased efficiency and reliability Tested according to national and international standards, such as IEC, ANSI, GOST R and GB Double side break disconnectors are primarily used in substations with limited phase space and where a vertical opening of the current path is not possible. The current path makes a horizontal rotating movement. Main features and advantages: Has three supporting insulators The center insulator can rotate and carries the current path Outer supporting insulators carry the fixed contacts Two open separation sections Compact and stable design allows for high mechanical tensile loads Combination with surge arresters possible Available with self-interlocking mechanism and in various colors Sophisticated contact system ensures long service life and requires no maintenance effort Extended RIV limits for each voltage level reduce magnetic interference for increased efficiency and reliability Tested according to national and international standards, such as IEC, ANSI, GOST R and GB Pantographs require the smallest possible mounting space and are connected to the busbar with its characteristic scissors. Main features and advantages: Vertical disconnection Busbar connection Diagonal or parallel arrangement Applicable for flexible and rigid busbar connections Compact and stable design allows for high mechanical and thermal loads Self-interlocking mechanism prevents opening during a short circuit Sophisticated contact system ensures long service life and requires no maintenance effort Tested according to national and international standards, such as IEC, ANSI, GOST R and GB The current path of the vertical break disconnector opens in the vertical direction, making small phase distances possible. Vertical break disconnectors carry out two movements: a vertical swinging movement, and a rotary movement around its own longitudinal axis. Main features and advantages: The great distance between the supporting and rotating insulators ensures the dielectric strength of the parallel insulation, even in saline fog conditions Delivered in finished assemblies, reducing the time required for installation and commissioning Available with self-interlocking mechanism and in various colors Tested according to national and international standards, such as IEC, ANSI, GOST R and GB Modular Design All device/construction types consist of the same basic components and are mostly identical: Current path Contact system* Supporting insulator* Rotating insulator* Base frame Connecting rods** Drive * except for pantographs ** except for center break disconnectors Contact systems Our contact systems offer the following advantages: Short circuit conditions increase the contact force Highest dynamic/thermal stability in the event of leakage current Optimized for applications with silver plating Lubrication free solution Maintenance-free (long term) Many years of operating experience (+ 40 years) Our contact system concept is largely based on the original RUHRTAL design Classic (no spring) Uses material flexibility 2 contact points per finger 3DN1 N00 Application Latest center break disconnector development focused on optimizing the base frame with a current path of S00 3DN1 S00 application Latest current path optimization combines our classic contact system (R00) and modern current path arm (I00) 3DN1 R00 Application Classic contact system with classic current path arm Modern (with springs) Uses springs (stainless steel, optional enclosure) 1 contact point per finger 3DN1 I00 Application Our modern contact system and modern profile-based current path arm (I00) Straight flat finger 3DN1 B00 Application Our modern contact system and classic current path arm (B00) Curved flat finger Drive systems Our drive systems offer the following advantages: Completely finished and pre-adjusted assemblies simplify installation and commissioning Sturdy, stainless steel housing according to IP 54, standard paint Can be mounted on switch base on request IEC tested auxiliary switch with highest endurance class for greatest reliability Anti-condensation heater Fulfills the latest international standards, such as IEC, GOST R and GB Our 3DV8 motor drive It consists of three main components: the housing, the gear unit with motor, and the electrical equipment with auxiliary switch. A motor-integrated transmission ensures maintenance-free operation and security, as well as low noise levels. Technical data Our 3DV4 manual drive system It is characterized by its main components, such as the housing and electrical equipment, as well as the operation using the lockable hand lever, which ensures the highest possible safety during maintenance and service work. Technical data Our 3DV1 control unit It consists of main components such as the housing and electrical equipment, and offers a special advantage: It collects signals and centralizes single pole operating mechanisms or disconnector and earthing operating mechanisms.

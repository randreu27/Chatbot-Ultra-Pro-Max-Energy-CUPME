The pillars of transformer 
resilience
T ransformers are essential for improving 
grid resilience because they play a critical 
role in the transmission and distribution 
of electricity. They help maintain the sta -
bility and reliability of the electric grid by 
stepping up and stepping down voltage 
levels, which ensures efficient power flow 
and minimizes energy losses. In the face efficient power flow. The development of 
resilience transformers involves innova -
tive designs and advanced materials that 
enhance their ability to withstand and 
quickly recover from disruptions. This in -
cludes the use of high-temperature insu -
lation systems, such as aramid paper and 
ester liquids, which improve thermal per -
formance and reduce the risk of failures.

of increasing challenges such as climate 
change, extreme weather events, and 
growing energy demands, resilient trans -
formers are crucial for maintaining a con -
tinuous and reliable supply of electricity.
T o enhance grid resilience, transformers 
need to meet several key features:
• Advanced Insulation Systems: 
Using high-temperature insulation 
materials, such as aramid paper and 
ester liquids, improves thermal perfor -
mance and reduces the risk of failures
• Flexibility and Versatility: Tr ans -
formers should be capable of operating 
at multiple voltage levels and adapting 
to various configurations. This flexi -
bility allows for an optimized number of spare transformers and at the same 
time allow rapid deployment and in -
tegration into existing infrastructure, 
minimizing downtime, and improving 
grid stability
• Rapid Deployment: T ransformers 
designed for quick installation and 
easy integration can help restore pow -
er swiftly during outages or emergen -
cies. Mobile and plug-and-play trans -formers are examples of such designs
• Enhanced Safety: Using ester insu -
lation as an alternative to mineral oil 
provides additional safety by lowering 
fire and explosion risks. This allows 
transformers to be placed in protected 
environments and urban areas with re -
duced safety distances
• Sustainability: Incorporating envi -

under various conditions.
One key development is the use of 
high-temperature insulation systems and 
ester liquids, such as Midel® 7131, which 
improve thermal performance and 
reduce the risk of fire and environmental 
harm.

There are different types of area station 
transformers, each tailored to specific re -
quirements:
AST Type 1: This type is designed to re -
place transformers with multiple MV A 
ratings (10-90MV A) and different imped -
ances and low noise. It uses high-tempera -
ture winding insulation incl Midel 7131 
and sophisticated winding arrangements 
to meet diverse utility needs
AST Type 2: Focuses on a 10% higher 
power rating without compromising size 
and noise constraints in substations. It is 
designed to reduce the complexity and 
use of high temperature insulation ma -
terials.
AST Type 3: This type combines the 
features of AST Type 1 and AST Type 
2, using high-temperature insulation 
parts and Midel® 7131 to achieve both 
high performance and environmental 
sustainability. Four operation modes 
and multiple impedance bands cov -
er a broad range of operating condi -
tions and incorporate various trans -
former types and impedance bands.  
 The innovative winding setup concept, 
featuring tap-changers, enables seamless 
switching between different winding 
connections. This design incorporates 
insulation materials like aramid and fi -
berglass, which support high-tempera -
ture requirements for safe operation.  
 
This resilient transformer can operate 
at ratings of 58 MV A, 65 MV A, or 93 
MV A, with primary voltages of either 
132 kV or 65 kV , and secondary volt -
ages of 13.8 kV , 28 kV , or 35 kV . The 
regulation of the secondary voltage is 
achieved through an on-load tap chang -
er (OLTC), with impedance ranging 
from 9.91% to 22% to match the existing 
installed fleet. These operating options 
necessitate a winding setup with eleven individual windings per phase, man -
aged by four de-energized tap-chang -
ers (DETC) and one OLTC. The OLTC 
regulates ±16 steps for the low voltage 
windings, while the DETCs switch be -
tween the selected nominal voltage and 
impedance levels.

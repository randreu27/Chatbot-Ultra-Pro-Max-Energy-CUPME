Industry Problem/Challenge Statement
An effective Process Safety management framework is 
essential for Hydrogen, Ethanol, and Biofuel processing 
facilities to operate safely and reliably amidst incessant 
change.  Change, not properly managed, can introduce 
safety hazards and risks into an operation that can lead 
to catastrophic consequences affecting people, assets, 
the environment, and overall business continuity.  In the 
transition to a renewable energy future, the changing 
demand on existing renewable fuel processing facilities and 
the need for new facilities will require operators to continue 
to employ a robust process safety and risk management 
framework across the production, transportation, storage, 
and consumption renewable value chain to ensure a safe, 
sustainable, and reliable operation.Siemens Energy Solutions

Ouroutlook forfiscal year 2021
We expect global macroeconomic development to
remain subdued infiscal year 2021 ,withrisks particularly
related togeopolitical and geo-economic uncertainties .
Our markets tend tohave alimited effect toeconomic
cycles and our businesses, especially our service
business, arecharacterized byahigh level ofresilience .
Nevertheless, weobserve with concern theresurgence
oftheglobal COVID -19pandemic and increasing local
lockdown situations .Inmany countries ouroperations
aredeemed system critical andthus areexempted from
themeasures imposed byauthorities .
This guidance assumes nofurther financial impact from
COVID -19during fiscal year 2021 .We are hence
monitoring the recent spike innew infections with
concern and evaluate appropriate measures asit
pertains toourguidance .This outlook excludes charges
related tolegal andregulatory matters .Siemens

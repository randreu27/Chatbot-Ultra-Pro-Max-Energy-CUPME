(Applicable for SST900/ SST800/ SST700/ SST600/ SST500/ 
SST400/ SST300/ SST200/ legacy fleet)
Scope of work & Implementation
Lifetime Assessment (LTA) includes 3 stages –LTA theoretical study; 
Inspection and NDT testing; and recommendations for lifetime extensionProduct Overview 
The program is recommended for turbines nearing its design lifetime or 
100,000 equivalent operating hours. Careful investigation by our 
experienced engineers make it possible to extend the operating life of the 
steam turbine by tens of years at a limited investment cost
Failure risk during turbine lifetimeBenefits1
•In a recent success story involving an IST with 310 starts operating at 
540o C and 114 bar pressure, we achieved,
•85,000 additional operating hours for the turbine
•< 1 year of ROI
•Higher availability and reliability of a turbine at end of its design life
•Cost & CO2 savings from avoidance of manufacturing a replacement 
turbine
1 Benefits depend on the unit type, MW, and application and will differ from customer to customer. CO2 savings 
from increased

Higher than expected electricity growth drives GT business
The market environment forSiemens Energy continues toimprove with electricity demand exceeding growth
expectations .The graph below shows how, over aperiod ofjust two years, mid-term expectations forelectricity
consumption growth have increased .Inorder tobeable toaccommodate thisgrowth inelectricity consumption our
customers have been placing orders andwillcontinue todosointhefuture .
Siemens Energy isdiligently working ontheturnaround ofSiemens Gamesa, below isanupdate oncurrent developments :
▪There arenonew technical findings andnomaterial changes tocost assumptions related toquality topics

and5.Xplatform ,butwithaheavily reduced number ofvariants
▪The4.Xsales activity inEurope willresume bytheendofthisfiscal year
▪Ourramp upcontinues andisprogressing asplanned inCuxhaven, Aalborg andLeHavre
▪InHull wehave stillnotreached thedesired output volume, buthave been able toaccelerate theramp upof
theworkforce andtoavoid project delays byadding capacities atHullandsome ofourother factories
▪TheSG14platform willbeourvolume product atleast until theendofthedecade
▪Weareprogressing thecentral function integration ofSiemens Gamesa into Siemens Energy
▪Wearedriving aclearer andflatter organization inlinewithSiemens Energy principles .Inthenew setup,we
will integrate Service and New Unit business forOnshore and forOffshore ,with focus onaclose
relationship withourcustomers .This willallow ustoimprove thevalue proposition across allplatforms .

able tocapitalize onthistrend and experienced stronger
than expected order and revenue growth .Orders have
been exceeding revenue forthelastthree andahalfyears
and these orders arenow converting into strong revenue
growth andasolid margin expansion .Wetherefore raised
the guidance for GT and now expect comparable
revenue growth of32%to34%(previously 18%to22%)
and aProfit margin before special items between 8%
and10%(previously between 7%and9%)thisfiscal year.
Grid Technologies
Asaresponse tothisdynamic demand growth, westarted toincrease ourcapacities inGT.Over thepast months, we
launched anew factory expansion intheU.S.toaddress thethestrong demand forpower transformers .Wewill
invest 150million USD tobroaden ouroperations inCharlotte, North Carolina, creating almost 600new jobs.Bydoing
so,wewilladdtoourexisting operations bybuilding Siemens Energy’s first transformer factory intheU.S.,todeliver
vitalinfrastructure andtoenable thecountry’s energy transition .
Today, only 20%ofU.S.large power transformer demand ismet
bydomestic supply with lead times ofuptofive years .Power
transformers provide the link between generation and
distribution and areacrucial part ofany electricity distribution
network where they convert high-voltage electricity into lower
voltages .Custom built power transformers ofaround thesize ofa
standard school bus are essential components inany grid
expansion .They enable thereliable transmission ofelectricity
over long distances and help stabilize electrical transmission
across regions .

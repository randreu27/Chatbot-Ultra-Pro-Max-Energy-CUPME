Operational performance
Clean by nature
CompetitivenessFocus on Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) 
electrolyzer system technology
•Small footprint compared to alkaline systems
•Lower OPEX compared to alkaline systems due to maintenance free stack
•Competitive hydrogen price per kg at green electricity prices below 3 ct/kWh•Fast start -up and shut -down
•Highest operational flexibility 
•Cold start capability
•Highest hydrogen purity >99.9%
•No aggressive chemical electrolyte
•No contaminants –only water, hydrogen and oxygen in the system

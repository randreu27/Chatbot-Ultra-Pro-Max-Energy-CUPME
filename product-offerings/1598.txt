New 9000HL-class gas turbine 
breaking performance records
REPRINT
24    GAS TURBINE WORLD December 2022 www.gasturbineworld.comIn August 2022, Siemens Energy’s 
60Hz SGT6-9000HL gas turbine 
achieved a power output of 410.9 MW 
(corrected to ISO standard conditions) 
operating under a multi-year field-test 
and verification program at Duke En-
ergy’s Lincoln Combustion Turbine 
Station near Denver, North Carolina.  
This marked a major milestone in the 
development and commercialization 
of the advanced state-of-the-art HL gas 
turbine unveiled five years ago. Sie-
mens Energy and Duke Energy were 
awarded the Guinness World Records 
title for the most powerful simple cy-
cle 60Hz gas turbine power plant. 
This was followed by a second Guin-
ness World Records title in October, 
2022 for achieving the highest ramp 
rate for 60Hz gas turbine power plants 
at 100.56 MW/min.
The awards came at a time of re-
cord-high gas prices, making power 
density and efficiency more important 
than ever. 
Operational flexibility demonstrated 
by the HL is also good news for a mar -
ket seeing a rapid growth of renew-
ables in the power generation mix and 
critical need for grid support.
Market outlook
With high gas prices and climate 
change pressure, there is ongoing de-
bate in the industry over the future of 
the utility power generation gas tur -bine market. Recent data point to a 
positive outlook.
Market data for 2020 shows that only 
44GW of new gas turbine capacity 
was added worldwide. Data for 2021, 
the latest full-year available, show an increase of nearly 40% to 61GW.  
The general forecast is for the level to 
hold steady through 2025 and climb to 
65GW by 2030.
Several factors account for this pro-
jected growth in gas turbine capacity. Following two years of extended grid-connected operation, 
the first 9000HL advanced-class gas turbine has been tested 
and validated with results exceeding original design valuesLaunch HL-class gas turbine sets performance

www.gasturbineworld.com    GAS TURBINE WORLD December 2022     25The first, mostly affecting the market 
for small units, is distributed genera-
tion due to increasing industrial on-
site electricity demand and evolving 
decarbonization activities in sectors 
such as Oil & Gas. 
Demand for decarbonization of 
central heating is also increasing. 
Countries with high reliance on dis-
trict heating are moving away from 
coal-based systems and installing 
gas fired combined heat and power 
(CHP) plants.
In the large heavy frame gas turbine 
segment, several trends are driving 
new capacity additions. One is the ac-
celerated shift away from coal to gas, 
particularly in China, but also in parts 
of Asia, United States and Europe. 
At the same time, there is increasing 
penetration of intermittent wind and 
solar renewable energy which calls for 
more backup generation to meet de-
mand for reliable power and to keep 
grids stable. At the moment, the back-
up choice worldwide is gas power.
Even in Germany, which is severely 
affected by the Ukraine crisis, new gas 
turbine capacity is being bid over the 
next 2-3 years even as renewables are 
being added to replace coal. Similarly, gas projects are being bid 
in the United States, United Kingdom, 
Italy, Belgium and in Asia. Low rain-
fall in Brazil, China and elsewhere has 
also driven additions of gas capacity to 
make up for reduced hydropower.
In the longer term, Siemens Energy 
believes that gas power will remain a 
vital part of the energy transition and a 
viable solution for reliably supporting 
the accelerating growth in renewables.Evolutionary technology 
The need to operate in a market in 
which a rapidly growing share of re-
newable capacity was driving down 
the cost of electricity, the increasing 
need for flexible grid support greatly 
influenced and shaped the design phi-
losophy behind the HL gas turbine.
The machine is designed to be an ex-
cellent complement to fluctuating 
renewables as well as the core of a

26    GAS TURBINE WORLD December 2022 www.gasturbineworld.comhighly efficient and reliable base load 
power generating system.
When the 50Hz SGT5- and 60Hz SGT6-
9000HL were first announced five years 
ago, the expected simple cycle ratings 
were 567MW and 388MW respective-
ly; combined cycle ratings (1-on-1 sin-
gle shaft) were 841MW and 577 MW. Combined cycle efficiencies were 
expected to be over 63% with stated 
simple cycle efficiencies of 42.6% and 
42.3% for the 50Hz and 60Hz ver -
sions, respectively.
Following the two years of test and 
validation operation at the Duke Ener -
gy Lincoln Station, the current ratings 
offered for simple cycle and combined 
cycle substantially exceed those ear -
ly expectations, with the 60Hz plant 
power rating increased by about 13%  
versus original published ratings and 
the 50Hz plants by almost 5% (see Ta-
bles 1 and 2).
Like the H-class gas turbine, from 
which it evolves, the HL machine is 
air-cooled and has the same single tie-
bolt rotor construction concept with 
interlocked discs using Hirth serration 
couplings. 
It also uses Hydraulic Clearance Op-
timization to minimize the clearance 
between the turbine case and rotating 
blade tips during operation for in-
creased efficiency.  During start-up, 
clearances are increased to avoid rubs.
As with the H machine, the turbine 
stationary vane carriers and all turbine 
blades can be replaced without lifting 
the rotor from the engine.
Five areas of improvement
To complement the continued use of 
such proven design features, improve-
ments in efficiency and operating flex-ibility (compared with the H-class ma-
chine) stem from technology advances 
in five key areas: 
• compressor flow path, 
• low emissions combustion sys-
tem, 
• enhanced turbine blade cooling, 
• advanced thermal barrier coating 
(TBC), and
• cooling for the 4th stage turbine 
blade. 
Figure 2 shows a “covers-off” draw-
ing of the HL and the H gas turbines to 
illustrate the “shared DNA” between 
the two designs -- and to highlight the 
evolutionary advancements achieved 
by the HL engine.

www.gasturbineworld.com    GAS TURBINE WORLD December 2022     27proved aerodynamic efficiency which 
increases the compression ratio from 
21:1 in the H-class machine to 24:1 
for the HL. In addition, to reduce com-
plexity, the HL has one less variable 
guide vane than in the H design (two 
instead of three). 
A similar can-annular dry low emis-
sions combustion system retained 
from the H machine was modified 
to improve fuel/air mixing. The HL 
design also has a higher number of 
pre-mix burners surrounding the pilot 
burner which allows increasing the 
firing temperature for higher engine 
efficiency while maintaining low NOx 
levels. 
In addition to enabling higher engine ef-
ficiency, the combustor design is a key 
contributor to the gas turbine’s improved 
ramp rate and part-load capability.
The HL retains a 4-stage turbine de-sign, a long time feature of Siemens En-
ergy heavy frame gas turbines. But the 
higher firing temperature calls for blade 
design improvements, including up-
graded thermal barrier coatings (TBC). 
In the HL turbine, TBC is used on vane 
rows 1 to 4 and blade rows 1 to 3. The 
last (4th) stage turbine blade is not 
coated.
Special attention was given to the row 1 
vane where higher operating tempera -
tures call for increased coating thick -
ness and structural reliability.  For this 
purpose Siemens Energy developed 
a technology to enable increasing the 
thickness of the TBC while minimiz -
ing the increase in thermal stresses.
In addition to improved TBC appli -
cation, higher firing temperature is 
enabled by an enhanced turbine blade 
heat transfer design (Figure 4) with-
out requiring more cooling air. This is important since bleeding compressor 
air for turbine cooling reduces engine 
power output and efficiency. 
The new HL last stage turbine blade 
features internal cooling to cope with 
higher exhaust gas temperatures which 
increased by over 40°C (72°F) from 
that of the H-class to about 680°C 
(1256°F). This has a positive impact 
on the steam bottoming cycle, deliver -
ing higher combined cycle power and 
efficiency. 
Also, the new HL last stage blade is 
a free-standing design (i.e., unshroud-
ed), which reduces exit losses and thus 
improves both simple cycle and com-
bined cycle efficiencies.
In another move to improve engine 
performance, the HL features ambi -
ent-air cooling for the turbine exhaust 
struts, whereas the H machine uses 
compressor bleed for this purpose.

28    GAS TURBINE WORLD December 2022 www.gasturbineworld.comTesting and validation
The two-year on-grid field test operating 
period represents the third and final 
step in Siemens Energy’s three-phase 
process for testing and validating the 
HL engine. 
The process began with testing key 
components at the company’s Clean 
Energy Center in Berlin, followed by 
engine tests on a full-scale rig. The 
Duke Energy installation allows the 
engine to be put through its paces un-
der real-life conditions for extended 
periods -- with results fed back into 
the design.
Over 6,000 sensors monitor perfor -
mance of the new 3D compressor 
blading, advanced combustion sys-
tem, internal turbine cooling features, 
thermal barrier coatings, and new last 
stage turbine blade. 
The engine at the Lincoln Combustion 
Turbine Station is installed in a simple 
cycle arrangement featuring a dilution 
SCR for added NOx reduction  and an 
air preheater to simulate a range of 
ambient temperatures (see Figure 5). 
Essentially, says Duke Energy, it was 
installed to complement the growing 
number of renewables in the compa -
ny’s portfolio. 
“Duke Energy is pursuing an aggres-
sive clean energy transition, already 
achieving more than 40% carbon re-duction since 2005,” says Kevin Mur -
ray, vice president of Project Manage-
ment & Construction at Duke Energy. 
“The new gas turbine at our Lincoln 
site will become the most fuel-effi-
cient gas turbine in our fleet”, contin-
ues Murray. “The unit’s fast start and 
high ramp rate capability will support 
the increase in renewables we are plac-
ing on our system while complement -
ing our journey to net-zero carbon 
from electricity generation by 2050.”
Duke Energy has over 45 solar farm 
facilities in the state of North Carolina, 
adding its first solar projects in Surry, 
Cleveland and Cabarrus counties at 
the start of 2022. The new gas turbine 
will provide backup power when there 
is no or low renewable generation and 
to help smooth any fluctuations in the 
grid caused by intermittent renewable 
generation (see Figure 6).
The HL’s fast ramping capability and 
high power output are key features for 
balancing the grid with the addition 
of more renewables capacity. Since it 
became operational, Duke Energy has 
been dispatching the plant as needed to 
perform critical load-following service. 
Despite its large size, the gas turbine 
has demonstrated a fast load-ramp 
rate and short overall start time, going 
from turning gear to full load in less 
than 10 minutes. Although the original fact sheet prom-
ised a ramp rate of 85MW per minute, 
the engine demonstrated capability 
even beyond that, 100.56 MW/min to 
be precise, which earned that second 
Guinness World Records title. 
Exceeding expectations
Overall, targets for operational flexi -
bility have been exceeded at the Lin-
coln site and the engine has demon-
strated 100% ignition reliability.
The combustion system has shown ro-
bust low-emissions performance due 
to Siemens Energy’s combustor pre-
mix design. All emissions targets have 
been met, with the engine demonstrat-
ing 25 ppm NOx and 10 ppm CO on 
natural gas fuel. 
With these field-proven results, Sie-
mens Energy can now offer the HL 
with a minimum emission-compliant 
load of <28% its full base load power 
output. 
Also, the SGT6-9000HL runs longer 
between maintenance cycles than ear -
lier designs and will be the most effi-
cient gas turbine in Duke Energy’s fleet 
when they assume ownership in 2024.  
It is 34% more efficient, i.e., display-
ing 25% lower heat rate, than existing 
combustion turbines at the site.
Since installation, the engine has been 
through an endurance run to accumu -
late hours on the clock and to evaluate 
long-term effects on critical compo-
nents. Thermal paint tests and, more 
recently, wet compression testing have 
been completed. 
Dual fuel capability has also been 
demonstrated. The HL engine at the 
Lincoln site has been operated on both 
natural gas and distillate fuel -- with 
all design targets and test-rig results 
validated on both fuels. 
Operators have demonstrated not only 
running capability but also fuel trans-
fer in both directions and start-ups on 
both gas and distillate fuels. Based on 
rig testing in Berlin, the engine can 
also run on 100% propane.

www.gasturbineworld.com    GAS TURBINE WORLD December 2022     29Given today’s emphasis on the energy 
transition, it is noteworthy that the en-
gine was also rig tested on a fuel blend 
of natural gas plus up to 50% (by vol-
ume) hydrogen to ensure that the tur -
bine is future-ready.
Commercial operation 
An agreement with Duke Energy al-
lows ongoing testing and operation of 
the engine until the end of 2024 when 
the utility officially takes possession 
of the plant. This will allow Siemens 
Energy to continue using the HL to de-
velop further technology advances. 
Meanwhile, Duke Energy has issued 
a formal letter to Siemens Energy to 
confirm that the plant has been com-
mercially dispatching to the grid while 
the engine has been under test since 
May 2020. 
This replaces the customary certifica -
tion of the unit’s Commercial Opera-
tion Date (COD) since the engine has 
been running for some time. For Sie-
mens Energy, this means that the plant 
can be an official commercially oper -
ating reference.
Because of the 2-year field testing and 
validation program, and exceeding the 
Duke Energy contractual values, the 
simple cycle power rating for future of-
ferings of the 60Hz 9000HL has been 
increased by over 13% to 440MW (up 
from an original 388MW rating).  
Likewise, simple cycle efficiency 
has been increased by almost a full 
percentage point to 43.2% (up from 
42.3%). For Duke Energy, this high ef-
ficiency means the engine will be the 
first to be dispatched on the grid.
For future 60Hz combined cycle offer -
ings, the 60Hz 1-on-1 9000HL plant is 
now rated at 655MW (up 13.5% from 
577MW) at over 64% LHV efficiency. 
Validation of 50Hz design 
Validation and testing of the 50Hz 
SGT5-9000HL machine has also been 
carried out at SSE Thermal’s new 
Keadby 2 gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant proj-
ect in the United Kingdom. 
Initially planned as an 8000H project, 
the gas turbine was upgraded to the 
9000HL in 2018 following introduc-
tion of the HL engine.  In March 2020, 
through the UK’s Capacity Auction 
process, the station secured a 15-year 
capacity agreement at a derated capac -
ity of 803.7MW.
The ‘1-on-1’ combined cycle installa -
tion at Keadby 2 will be the largest and 
most efficient CCGT plant in Europe 
providing reliable and flexible back up 
to renewables. 
In the case of the 50Hz HL field test 
program, over 3,000 sensors were in-
stalled on the engine. Fewer sensors 
were needed than with the Duke Ener -
gy unit because it is a scaled version of 
the 60Hz engine -- meaning that many 
tests carried out at the Duke Energy fa-
cility need not be repeated. 
This is a good example of leveraging 
the theoretical and well proven scaling 
rules between 50 and 60Hz machines. 
However, experience has proven that 
certain items, particularly the combus-
tion system, do not follow these rules 
and require more thorough testing and 
validation.  
Field verification testing at Keadby 2 
means that both the 50Hz and 60Hz 
versions of the 9000HL have now been 
validated, with all but the final perfor -
mance test and reliability run still to 
come. 
The Keadby 2 installation also demon-
strated the improved field constructa -
bility offered by applying standardiza -
tion of the auxiliary systems as adopted 
under Siemens Energy’s Auxiliary In-
tegrated Packages (AIP) concept. 
Under AIP, the majority of the auxil -
iaries are delivered to the site as con-
tainer-sized modules and enjoy “plug 
and play” connectivity. That saves sig-
nificant time, effort, and project risk in 
the field.Moving forward
Keadby 2 illustrates that Siemens En-
ergy is supporting the journey towards 
a zero CO 2 emissions world. 
Once operational, the HL plant in the 
industrial Humber region will realize 
a savings of 3.7 Mt of CO 2 per year or 
a 62% reduction in carbon emissions 
compared to an equivalent coal fired 
plant.  When the unit is run on 50% hy-
drogen as planned, this will result in a 
further 22% reduction. 
The journey towards zero CO 2 emis-
sions plants continues with potential 
for running on 100% green hydrogen 
or adding post combustion carbon cap-
ture.  In the UK’s Humber area alone 
there are already several industrial 
projects being developed to capture 
carbon and produce potential sources 
of hydrogen.  
The same is true in other parts of Eu-
rope, Asia and the United States where 
large investments in decarbonization 
are being accelerated by several gov-
ernment incentive programs.
The impressive results from Duke En-
ergy’s Lincoln Station and SSE Ther -
mal’s Keadby 2 installations are the 
first steps for the development and 
commercialization program that Sie-
mens Energy has implemented for the 
9000HL. 
While there are over 100 H-class GTs 
under contract, with over 84 units in 
commercial operation, there are also 
21 HL-class units under contract. 
These HL turbines on order, both 50Hz 
and 60Hz, are spread throughout the 
world including the US, Mexico, Bra-
zil, UK, Greece, Belgium, Italy, South 
Korea and Taiwan – showing that con-
fidence in the technology spans across 
the globe.

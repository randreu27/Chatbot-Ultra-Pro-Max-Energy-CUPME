Munich, November 10, 2020  – Siemens Energy today announced its results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 , that ended September 30, 2020.  
Successful spin -off and solid Q4  
Christian Bruch, President and Chief Executive Officer of Siemens Energy AG said  „I am proud how our Siemens  Energy team managed the macroeconomic 
challenges, successfully executed the spin -off of our company while further streamlining our portfolio. We have fully achieved our fiscal year 2020 guidance 
and confirm our outlook for fiscal year 2021. With an outsta nding and committed team we look forward to the transformation journey that lies ahead of us , 
as we are opening a new chapter as Siemens Energy  (SE).” 
Fiscal Year 2020
• On September 28th trading of Siemens Energy  AG’s shares started on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. This concluded the successful carve -out and subse-
quent spin -off of Siemens AG’s ener gy related activities and marks an important milestone in our business transformation.  
• In line with our strategy and due to lower demand and unfavorable market conditions , we decided to streamline our aeroderivative gas turbine portfolio .  
• The global Corona virus pandemic  (Covid -19) adversely affected our operational  performance  and financial results . Throughout the crisis we have been 
able to support our customers to maintain their critical infrastructure , whilst ensuring a safe working env ironment for our employees and partners.  
• Orders rose by 1% to €34bn to a book -to-bill ratio of 1.24 resulting in a fiscal year -end order backlog of €79bn.  
• Revenue decreased by 5% while Adjusted  EBITA before Special Items was close to break -even at neg. €1 7m and a margin of neg. 0.1% , being clearly within 
the guidance range (neg. 1 to pos. 1 %). A positive contribution from segment Gas and Power (GP) of €254m (1.4%) was largely offset by a loss at our 
other segment Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) of neg. €249m (neg. 2.6%).  
• Special Items including impairments and write -downs related to strategic portfolio decisions (€956m), severance and SGRE integration costs (€376m)  and 
stand -alone costs (€195m)  amounted to a total of €1.526m leading to a negative A djusted  EBITA of €1.5bn (neg. 5.6%).  
• SE recorded a net loss of €1.9bn resulting in  basic earnings per share (EPS) of neg. €2.21. Despite this loss , we generated a free cash flow pre tax of 
€977m.  
Q4 Fiscal Year 2020
• In line with our expectations , group orders decreased by 24% to €7.0bn as both segments, GP and SGRE, had very strong order intake in the prior -year 
quarter.  
• Revenue declined by 8% to €7.6bn mainly driven by GP , SGRE revenue declined moderately.  
• Adj. EBITA before Special Items decline d from €523m to €70m, resulting in a margin of 0.9%. Despite Covid -19, rising costs related to increased bank fees, 
the substitution of parent company guarantees (provided by Siemens AG) and ongoing project execution challenges at SGRE , both segments reported 
positive results.  
• Special Items including severance and SGRE integration  costs of €186m and  stand -alone costs of €157m amounted to neg. €402m, leading to a decline in 
Adj. EBITA from pos. €207m to neg. €332m and a margin of neg. 4. 3%. 
• For the quarter Siemens Energy booked a net loss of €390m compared to a net income  of €79m in the prior -year quarter. Free cash flow pre tax was 
strong at €704m, albeit lower than the high cash flow pre tax recorded in the prior -year quarter in both se gments.  Earnings Release

• In line with  our expectations group orders declined by 24% to €7.0bn as 
both GP and SGRE had very strong order intake in the prior -year quarter.  
• Revenue declined by 8% to €7.6bn mainly driven by GP because of pro-
ject delays and deferrals due to Covid -19 in all divisions. SGRE’s revenue 
was down by 3%.  
• The book -to-bill ratio came in at 0.92. The order backlog reached a year -
end level of €79bn; up from €77bn at the end of FY  2019 mainly driven 
by a record order entry year of SGRE.  
• Adj. EBITA before Special Items declined f rom €523m to €70m largely be-
cause of Covid -19. GP was further impacted by rising costs related to in-
creased bank fees and the substitution of parent company guarantees 
(provided by Siemens AG) . Segment SGRE was operationally influenced 
by ongoing  project  execution challenges  in the o nshore  business . Both 
segments, GP and SGRE were impacted by significant Special Items re-
sulting in Adj. EBITA of neg. €332m. For the group , Special Items rose by 
€86m to neg. €402m largely driven by non -recurring stand -alone co sts of 
€157m.  
• Working capital management drove free cash flow  pre tax performance 
to €704m, largely driven by stringent reduction of accounts receivables 
overdue and inventories in GP .

• Orders at GP decreased by 27% to €4.4bn. The decline reflects a high 
base of comparison as GP recorded several large orders in the prior year 
quarter , project shifts in Generation and Industrial Applications due to 
Covid -19 and adverse market conditions . Major orders included a large 
order in Canada (€ 0.3bn ) for a 900MW natural gas  combined cycle power 
plant and the seventh grid connection project in Germany with HVDC 
technology (€ 0.3bn). Segment order backlog reached €48bn at the end 
of the fiscal year.  
• Albeit lower revenue levels than in the prior year  end quarter strong per-
forman ce in the service business  could not compensate weaker new unit 
and solutions business in all divisions, leading to an expected decline of 
11% in comparison to Q4 FY  2019. 
• Adj. EBITA before Special Items remained positive at €43m and a margin 
of 0.9%, desp ite effects from Covid -19 and rising costs related to bank 
fees and the substitution of parent company guarantees (provided by 
Siemens AG).  
• Including Special Items of neg. €237m , Adj. EBITA was negative at €194m. 
Special Items include severance charges for the partial closure of a manu-
facturing site in France and stand -alone costs of €102m.  
• Diligent execution o f operating working capital management drove free 
cash flow pre tax of €403m , where the  largest contribution c ame  from 
accounts receivables and inventory reductions in Generation and Trans-
mission.  Free cash flow pre tax was down from a very high  level  of just 
over € 1bn in the prior -year end quarter .

• Solid order intake of €2.6bn, decrease of 17% driven by substantial on-
shore orders including several large  orders in India in the prior -year quar-
ter. Strong performance across FY  2020 quarters lead to a record order 
backlog of €30bn up by 19% in comparison to  FY 20 19. 
• Revenue declined moderately by 3% to €2.9bn, negative Covid -19 im-
pacts and delays in onshore project execution were partially offset by 
strong service business fueled by the Senvion integration.  
• Adj. EBITA before Special Items was positive with a p rofitability of 1.1% 
(€30m). Operational performance was impacted  by Covid -19 as well as 
continuing operational challenges in Onshore, that are being addressed 
by the current restructuring and LEAP program. Considering Special 
Items of neg. €110m , Adj. EBI TA amounted to neg. €80m compared to 
€125m in the prior -year quarter.  
• Free cash flow pre-tax came in at €105m, down from the very high free 
cash flow  pre tax of just over €1bn in the prior -year quarter.

• Reconciliating items largely reflect special items of non-recurring stand -

• During the quarter SE’s provision for pensions and similar obligations de-
creased from €1,095m as of June 30, 2020 to €1,057m as of September 
30, 2020. While the Defined Bene fit Obligations (DBO ) were stable due to 
various off -setting effects, the plan assets increased from €2,315m to 
€2,378m mainly due to planned, regular funding of €59m in Germany .  
 Earnings Release Q4  FY 2020 | Siemens Energy  
4 Outlook  
We expect  global  macroeconomic  development  to remain  subdued  in fiscal  2021,  with  risks  particularly  related  to geopolitical  and geo-economic  
uncertainties.  Our markets  tend  to have  a limited  effect  to economic  cycles  and our business es especially  our service business is characterized by a 
high level of resilience . Nevertheless,  we observe with concern the resurgence of the global pandemic Covid -19 and increasing local lock -down situa-
tions. In many countries our  operations are deemed sys tem critical and thus are exempted from many measures imposed by authorities .  
 
We confirm our guidance for fiscal year 2021 as presented at our Capital  Market  Day on September  1st, 2020  and in our prospectus : 
 
• For Siemens  Energy  in fiscal  year  2021  we expect  nominal  revenue  growth  to be in the range  of 2%-12%  and an Adj. EBITA  margin  before  
Special  Items  of 3%-5%. 
 
• For our Gas and Power  segment  in fiscal  year  2021  we assume  a return  to revenue  growth  compared  to the fiscal  year  2020 and thus  
nominal  revenue  growth  to be in the range  of 2%-11%  and an Adj. EBITA  margin  before  Special  Items  of 3.5% -5.5%.   
 
• Our Siemens  Gamesa  Renewable  Energy  segment  is expected  to grow  its revenue  by 3%-12%  nomina lly, driven  by the conversion  from  
existing  order  backlog  as well as a stable  development  of the service  and product  business  and achieve  an Adj. EBITA  margin  before  Spe-
cial Items  of 3%-5%. 
 
This guidance  does  not reflect  further  financial  impact  from  Covid -19 during  fiscal  year  2021.  We are monitoring  the recent  spike  in new  infections  
with  concern  and evaluate  appropriate  measures  as it pertains  to our guidance.   
This outlook  excludes  charges  related  to legal  and regulatory  matters.

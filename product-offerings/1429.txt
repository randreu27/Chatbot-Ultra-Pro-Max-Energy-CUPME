Executive Board
Remuneration System
January 2025 © Siemens Energy, 20254German Government counter -guarantees required after Siemens Energy 
experienced enormous demand
•In order to secure continued order growth and thus, job creation in Germany, the German government agreed that it will counter -guarantee €7.5bn of a 
total amount of €12bn of guarantees, of which €11bn are provided to Siemens Energy by a consortium of banks. The remaining €1bn has been provided by an 
additional consortium led by Deutsche Bank. 
•In return, the Federal Government demanded a considerable fee from Siemens Energy
Additionally, the Federal Government demanded the 
company to agree on a “dividend ban” and a “bonus 
ban”, meaning that there will be: 
1.No dividend payments to shareholders 
2.No compensation in excess of the fixed 
compensation to the Executive Board Members 
(i.e. no bonus, no long -term incentive) which brings 
down the management remuneration to about 35% of 
the regular target amount, which was set in line with 
comparable DAX executive board roles in Germany

January 2025 © Siemens Energy, 20255Impact on Executive Board compensation
Cut-off by 2/3 of the regular compensation 
Siemens Energy in comparison to market standards:
CEO Base Variable Total 
Siemens Energy €1.5m - €1.5m
GE Vernova1 €1.2m €5.1m €6.3m
Baker Hughes €1.6m €17.7m €19.3m
DAX €1.5m €3.7m €5.2m
S&P500 - - €15.7m
1On divisional terms as part of GE. GE Vernova remuneration expected to be significantly higher, 1.04 USD = 1 EUR
Example Siemens Energy CEO:
•Christian Bruch had a fixed compensation of €1.56m in 
FY24 
•€1.52m in FY23, as shown in the table on the right~35% including pension 
substitute in cash
January 2025 © Siemens Energy, 20256Challenge for the Supervisory Board : Stabilize company as going concern 
and retain management talent necessary for the turnaround and subsequent 
value creation
Status Quo: 
•Siemens Energy has been going through extremely challenging times , mainly driven by the wind business
•Executive Board successfully restructured the rest of the company (SE without Siemens Gamesa) since SE’s listing in 2020 
•Clear path towards break -even for Siemens Gamesa until 2026 in place
•Continuity of management has highest priority to further strengthen Siemens Energy’s growth and profitability
•Christian Bruch’s contract was renewed in September 2024 for another 5 years -Currently no competitive salary due to 
German Federal Government bonus ban –still commitment to continue to lead Siemens Energy in challenging times 
Approach of the Compensation Committee to cope with remuneration challenge
1.Find a fair solution for the members of the Executive Board: Company offers competitive remuneration for the time after the ban 
in order to retain management during the ban phase (with non -competitive compensation)
2.Honor future performance of management in alignment with shareholder returns 
3.Special remuneration is only temporary in nature to tackle the challenges associated with the restrictions from the Federal 
Government (one -time only)
4.Full compliance with the terms and conditions of the guarantee agreement with the Federal Government
January 2025 © Siemens Energy, 20257
One-off compensation after the end of the compensation restrictions
Equity Component :Each member oftheExecutive Board receives afixed amount incash under thecondition thattheir
Executive Board mandate continues atthebeginning ofthisfiscal year
Each member oftheExecutive Board isconditionally granted afixed number ofstock awards inthe
firstfiscal year after theendofthecompensation restrictions, subject toperformance criteria, the
condition thattheExecutive Board mandate continues atthebeginning ofthisfiscal year andlast
until theendofthevesting period .
Ifthedrawdown phase aswellasthetwo-year period following thedrawdown phase during which
guarantees canstillbeoutstanding (“rundown phase”) oftheFederal Guarantee endprematurely,
i.e.before theend ofthe2026 fiscal year, themembers oftheExecutive Board aregranted an
additional fixed cash payment•Forthefirstfiscal year after theendofthecompensation restrictions, themembers oftheExecutive Board aregranted one-offcompensation
•Itconsists ofnon-performance -based andperformance -based compensation components andisintended toensure thelong-term competitiveness oftheExecutive
Board compensation
•Themembers oftheExecutive Board aretobeincentivized tocontinue their work asmembers oftheExecutive Board during thecompensation restrictions despite
waiving their variable compensation –andthereby alarge portion oftheir regular compensation –andtocontribute totheCompany’s future development
•A vesting period of around two years begins at the start of the fiscal year following the end of the compensation restriction s, at the end of which Siemens Energy 
shares are transferred

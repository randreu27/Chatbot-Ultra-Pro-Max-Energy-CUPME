Press release  by Siemens Energy and Technip Energies  
Siemens Energy and Technip Energies 
announce joint development of decarbonized 
Rotating Olefins Cracker technology  and 
selection by Cracker of the Future 
Consortium  
• Rotating Olefins Cracker (ROC) technology  will a dvanc e the global energy transition by 
decarbonizing  olefin production processes  
• Demonstration project selected by the Cracker of the Future Consortium (COF)  of industry majors  
 
Technip Energies and Siemens Energy announce d an exclusive agreement to jointly develop, 
commercialize, and license the Rotating Olefins Cracker (ROC) technology  to decarbonize olefin 
production processes . The ROC technology employs a dynamic reactor system that replace s 
conventional furnaces used for pyrolysis when manufacturing  light olefins  – the building blocks for 
chemical products  used in everyday materials , from packaging to polymers .  
 
The ROC technology  offers driver flexibility , and when driven by electric -powered motors or 
hydrogen -fired gas turbines, the technology leads the path to decarboniz e the process  used to 
produce light olefins. The decarbonization impact is even more significant  when the elec tric power 
or hydrogen fuel is derived from renewable sources. The ROC process , once fully commercialized,  is Joint p ress release

also expected to have better first pass olefins yields with  similar operating costs compared to the 
currently commercially available technologies.   
 
The companies  have already validated the fundamentals of the reactor technology in laboratory 
testing and intend for the first turbomachin ery prototype to enter shop  testing in the first half of 
2022. Both companies bring specialized experience to  commercializing  this technology : Siemens 
Energy contributes its exper tise in turbomachinery, while Technip Energies has extensive 
knowledg e in pyrolysis cracking to produce  light olefins and process integration.  
 
As a significant  milestone in the commercialization of this groundbreaking technology, today 
Technip Energies and Siemens Energy entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with 
the Cracker of the Future Consortium (COF). The MOU expresses the intent of the parties t o 
negotiate a contract to install a hydrocarbon demonstration unit utilizing the ROC technology in a 
plant operated by one of the COF members.  
 
The COF comprises  major industry players Borealis ( member of the OMV Group ), BP, Repsol, 
TotalEnergies  SE, Versa lis (Eni) , and coordinator Brightlands Chemelot Campus. The COF selected 
the ROC technology after assessing many electricity -based heating technologies for olefin crackers.  
 
“The ROC technology is a step -change in cracking technology that leads to a signi ficant reduction in 
greenhouse gases when combined with clean energy sources ,” said Stan Knez, Chief Technology 
Officer at Technip Energies . ”This collaboration with Siemens Energy highlights our commitment to 
decarboniz ation, and w e are delight ed to have the ROC technology selected for the COF 
demonstration unit .” 
 
“It is our ultimate goal  to turn ideas into reality  as we support our customers in transitioning to a 
more sustainable world ,” said Thorbjörn Fors, Executive Vice President, Industrial Applicati ons at

Siemens Energy . “Engaging directly with major operators in the Cracker of the Future Consortium  is 
a great opportunity to materialize this objective. Furthermore, b y working together with our partner 
Technip Energies, we are taking an important step towards driving decarbonization forward.”  
 
“The ROC technology is a new paradigm in chemical process technology, as heating hydrocarbon 
molecules by converting the molecular  kinetic energy into heat  so that  that thermal cracking can 
occur, has never been done before ,” said Walter Vermeiren, Chair of the Cracker of the Future 
Consortium. “The Cracker of the Future Consortium is delighted to cooperate with Siemens Energy 
and Te chnip Energies on this unique opportunity.”

 Earnings Release  Q3 FY 202 4 
April  1 to June  30, 2024 
Munich, Germany , August 7, 2024  – Siemens Energy  today announced  its results for the third  quarter of fiscal year 202 4 that ended June  30, 202 4. 
Siemens Energy on track to meet full -year guidance including an improved 
cash outlook  
“The rapidly growing electricity market requires a wide range of our products. Especially our grid and gas turbine businesses are benefiting from 
this momentum. Importantly, with  growing our order backlog, we have been able to improve its margin quality as well. Despite all the challenges, 
we are optimistic about the future and after the first nine months, we are well on track to meet our full -year guidance ”, says Christian Bruch, 
President and CEO of Siemens Energy AG.  
• During  the third quarter of the fiscal year, Siemens Energy c ontinu ed to benefit from  the energy transition , with record order intake  at Gas 
Services  and record order backlog in both Gas Services and Grid Technologies . 
• Gas Services’ orders more than doubled year -over -year, orders of Siemens Energy overall decreased from a high level of comparison, mainly at 
Siemens Gamesa, and due to timing shifts at Grid Technologies . The decline  was 29.6% on a comparable basis (excluding currency translation 
and portfolio effects)  and orders came in with  €10.4bn. The b ook-to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) remained  above 1, driving the  order 
backlog to another record  high of €1 20bn. 
• Revenue grew by 18.5% on a comparable basis to  €8.8bn with substantial growth  at Grid Technologies, Transformation of Industry and Siemens 
Gamesa . 
• Siemens Energy’s Profit  before Special items  again was positive with  €49m (Q3 FY 2023: negative €2,048m) . Prior -year’s quarter was heavily 
burdened by quality issues in Siemens Gamesa’s  onshore business  as well as increased product costs and ramp -up challenges in the offshore 
business. Special items were positive  €69m (Q 3 FY 2023: negative  €41m) primarily related to the ongoing progress on disposals and the accel-
erated portfolio transformation . Profit  for Siemens Energy came in at positive €119m (Q 3 FY 2023: negative €2,089 m). 
• Siemens Energy reported a  Net loss of €102m (Q 3 FY 2023: €2,931m). Corresponding basic earnings per share (EPS) were  negative  €0.16 
(Q3 FY 2023: negative  €3.42). 
• Free cash flow pre tax was €727m (Q3 FY 2023: €27m) with positive contributions by all segments except Siemens Gamesa which continued 
to be negative , as expected . 
• Due to the good development  in the first nine month s, we now expect a positive Free cash flow pre tax in a range of €1.0bn to €1.5bn for the 
fiscal year (previously up to €1.0bn).

(30.4)%  on a nominal basis, revenue respectively by  17.2% . 
 • As expected, o rders were below  prior -year’s high  level  mainly driven 
by decreases at Siemens Gamesa and Grid Technologies , due to a 
sharply  lower volume from large orders  particularly in the new units 
business, which more than offset a sharp increase at  Gas Services . 
• Book -to-bill ratio came in at 1.18. Order backlog once again ex-
ceeded the previous record level and rose to  €120bn. 
• Revenue grew  significantly both on increases in service revenue and 
growth in the new unit s business . 
• Profit before Special items  and the corresponding margin sharply im-
proved  as prior -year’s quarter was heavily  impacted by Siemens 
Gamesa’s loss. In addition, Siemens Energy overall showed a  strong 
operational performance  while results were held back by one-time 
effects from legacy projects  at Gas Services  and T ransformation of 
Industry . 
• Special items in the quarter were positively impacted  by the  ongoing 
progress on disposals and the accelerated portfolio  transformation . 
• Sharp  improvement of Free cash flow pre tax was primarily driven by 
Grid Technologies reflecting higher  profit ability , consistent asset 
management  and order momentum .

 • Highest orders in a quarter to date  mainly due to large service con-
tract wins in the Middle East . Orders  were sharply above prior -year’s 
level  primarily due to a much higher  volume from large orders . 
Growth in the service business clearly exceeded the increase  in or-
ders in the new unit s business . 
• Book -to-bill ratio was 1.92. The o rder backlog  rose to €45bn. 
• Revenue was slightly above the level of the prior year . Clear g rowth 
in the  service business more  than offset the decrease in the new unit 
business  due to timing effects . 
• Profit before Special items and corresponding margin were below 
the strong prior -year ’s basis . An overall  solid operational perfor-
mance was burdened by negative one -time effect s including  the

the high prior -year basis of comparison which included an excep-
tional large order for offshore grid connections in the North Sea. The 
decrease related to the grid solution business, while t he product 
business showed sharp growth benefiting from strong global de-
mand, primarily in the U.S. and Germany . 
• Grid Technologies  reported a Book -to-bill ratio of 1.54 and the order 
backlog rose to €31bn. 
• Revenue again grew substantially , mainly in the solution  and prod-
uct business es. 
• Profit before Special items rose sharply and the corresponding mar-
gin improved significantly . In light o f an overall strong operational 
performance  the improvement was  driven by  higher  volume  and 
comparatively higher margin of the processed order backlo g.

• The o rder backlog was on previous quarter’s level of €8bn. Book-to-
bill ratio was 0.86 for the quarter . 
• Revenue substantially  increased  year-over -year with  all businesses  
contributing double -digit growth fueled by continued service mo -
mentum and strong execution of the order backlog . 
• Improvement of Profit  before Special item s and the corresponding 
margin was driven by strong operational performance, higher mar-
gin quality of the  order backlog and increased volume especially in 
the service business , over -compensating a one-time effect related to 
a legacy project .

(91.0)%  on a nominal basis, revenue respectively by  25.1% . 
 • As expected, o rders were sharply  down compared to  a strong prior -
year quarter . Onshore orders continued to be impacted by a tempo-
rary interruption of  sales activities  for the 4.X and 5.X turbines . In 
addition, the offshore and service businesses reported exceptional 
large orders in the prior year includ ing a single offshore order worth 
€2.3bn . 
• Book-to-bill ratio came in at 0.26. The  order backlog decreased  to 
€37bn. 
• Revenue grew substantially  with all business es contributing to the 
growth , but  led by the offshore business  in part reflecting  a reduced 
basis of comparison due to the reversal of revenue in the prior -year 
quarter associated with the circumstances mentioned belo w. 
• Profit before Special items again was negative , as expected . The rea-
son were still the  project margins burdened by higher planned costs 
due to the known quality issues as well as the increased product 
costs and ramp -up challenges in the offshore area which also heavily 
burdened prior -year’s quarter . In addition, r ecent quarter p rofit was 
negatively impacted because of  the standard annual updating of the 
statistical models utilized for the evaluation of the entire wind tur-
bine fleet . Changes in the estimates for new, existing and potential 
agreements with customers in major projects had an of fsetting ef-
fect.

6 Outlook  
We continue to  expect Siemens Energy  to achieve a comparable revenue growth (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) in a range 
of 10% to 12%. Profit margin before special items is expected between negative 1% and positive 1% . We expect a Net income of up to €1bn 
including impacts from disposals and the acceleration of the portfolio transformation.   
Due to the  good development in the first nine month s, we now expect  a positive Free cash flow pre tax in a range of €1.0bn to €1.5bn (previously 
up to €1.0bn). We continue to expect proceeds from disposals and the acceleration of the portfolio transformation of around p ositive €3.0bn.  
The outlook for Siemens Energy does not include charges related to legal and regulatory matters.  
Overall assumptions per business area  
• Gas Services  assumes  a comparable  revenue  growth  of negative  2% to 0% and a Profit  margin  before  special  items  of 9% to 11%.  
• Grid Technologies  plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of 32% to 3 4% and a Profit margin before special items between  8% and 
10% . 
• Transformation of Industry  expect s a comparable  revenue  growth  of 14% to 16%  and a Profit  margin  before  special  items  of 5% to 7%. 
• Siemens Gamesa  assumes a comparable revenue growth of 10% to 12% and a negative Profit before special items of up to €2.0bn (previously 
around €2bn) .

Packager Guidelines 
Section 0: Introduction 
 
 
The following guidelines are presented as recomme ndations to compressor packagers and the like 
when applying Siemens Energy high speed reciproc ating compressors (HSRC).  These guidelines 
are not intended to replace or inhibit the packager’ s own designs; the packager’s technical expertise 
and experience takes precedence over these general instructions. 
 Siemens Energy realizes that there are many fa ctors that go into a package design in order to 
compete and sell value.  Our 65+ years of experie nce as a compressor OEM, packager and service 
provider have allowed us to address certain aspect s of skid design that c an only benefit the packager 
and end-user of the equipment, espe cially when it comes to applying our compressors.  Proper 
installation is of extreme importance to the su ccessful commissioning, performance, reliability and 
longevity of the unit and these guidelines are only there to help insure that.  
For more detailed information that many not be contained in this guideline, please refer to the 
respective Instruction Manual or contact your local Siemens Energy HSRC Group contact for 
additional support.

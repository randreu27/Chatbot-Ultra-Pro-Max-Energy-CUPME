Solution
Benefits1
In a success story involving a Power Generation customer, 3 GE Model 
DRV -631 BFP turbines were successfully replaced with SST -DR fleet 
•Turbines with 10% increased output power were fitted with the same 
spacial requirements as the older GE turbines 
•Up to 30% potential decrease in CO2 emissions due to repowering 
•Cost and productivity benefits from quicker start and increased lifetime 
expectancy of the turbine
Scope of work & Implementation
•The transition process starts with a study followed by a customized new 
turbine footprint solutionFeatures
•Complete new turbine tailored to the customer parameters that can be 
setup on the existing foundation
•Only minor to none modifications required for the piping and periphery Product Overview 
Suited for all customers who want to replace their existing turbine 
(Siemens/Non -Siemens fleet) without major modifications to their site
1 Benefits depend on the unit type, MW, and application and will differ from customer to customer. 
Initial study where the engineer is working to identify the ideal SST -DR 
turbine type that has 10% increased output power as per customer 
requirements but at the same time fit in to the existing tight spaced 
turbine roomsUp to 30% CO2 
reduction potential

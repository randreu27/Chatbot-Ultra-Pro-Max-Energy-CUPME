Munich , November 16, 2022  
Siemens Energy strengthened business in 
challenging year – integration of Siemens 
Gamesa Renewable Energy is now the focus  
• Strong demand at Gas and Power countered by operational problems at Siemens Gamesa  
• Adjusted EBITA before special items of €379 million, margin at 1. 3% 
• Revenue increased nominally by 1.8%, order backlog with €97.4 billion at new record  
• Transformation continues to create a more agile and transparent organization  
• Due to net loss and expected challenges, no dividend proposed for 2022 fiscal year  
 
In times of  geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges, Siemens Energy demonstrated resilience. 
Its Gas and Power segment (GP) delivered a solid performance characterized by strong orders and 
increased profitability year -over-year. However, Siemens Energy’s ov erall performance was held 
back by the negative development at Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE). Siemens Energy 
largely met its adjusted guidance. While the Adjusted EBITA margin before special items fell slightly 
short of expectations, Siemens Energ y recorded a lower -than -expected  net loss and a  significantly  
higher free cash flow pretax . 
 
At its Annual Press Conference in Munich today, the energy technology company presents its key 
financial figures for the 2021/2022 fiscal year, which ended on Sept ember 30, 2022. Results for its 
segment SGRE, which is still listed as a separate company on the Spanish stock exchanges, were 
presented on November  10. 
  
Christian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy, summarizes the fiscal year:  
“In a challenging y ear we managed to again deliver solid results in our Gas and Power business, 
while Siemens Gamesa did not meet expectations. At Gas and Power, our operational excellence 
program is showing results. It was also important that we aligned our group structure with future 
needs. We will provide more transparency about business performance; flatter hierarchies give us 
the ability to take decisions faster. The integration of Siemens Gamesa will help to improve 
profitability at our wind business and allow it to del iver to its full potential”.  Press release

Weatherproofing in a transformative year  
 
The 2022 fiscal year was a year of geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges. For Siemens Energy, 
it was a year of transformation  in the pursuit of achieving profitability, flattening hierarchies, and 
dampening economic headwinds . The Gas and Power segment, which has been diligently executing 
its operational excellence program, managed to navigate both global supply chain disruptions as 
well as rising material costs.  
 
As a result of th e Ukraine war and imposed sanctions , Siemens Energy started taking provisions to 
exit its business in the country. In the fourth quarter, the company completed  the sale of a 65% 
stake in Siemens Gas Turbine Technologies (SGTT), which was co -owned by Russia n company Power 
Machines. A further sale of a factory in Voronezh  was completed on October 12.  
 
With its new operating model , Siemens Energy has created more transparency, agility, and 
flexibility. Starting October 1, the company is operating under a new s tructure, with fewer 
hierarchies and clearer responsibilities. Additionally, two new members have been appointed to its 
executive board:  
Anne -Laure de Chammard is responsible for the Transformation of Industry Business Area, which 
mainly focuses on reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions in industrial processes. Vinod 
Philip, previously Head of Strategy and Chief Technology Officer, is now responsible for the 
Management of Global Functions such as IT, procurement,  and innovation . 
 
At SGRE, new management has been put in place to rectify problems. The company’s turnaround 
program MISTRAL, designed to ensure profitable growth at the company, is underway. On May 21, 
2022, Siemens Energy announced a voluntary cash tender offer to acquire all outstan ding shares in 
SGRE., i.e., approximately 32.9 percent of the share capital, which Siemens Energy does not already 
own. Starting on November 8, minority shareholders have the possibility to tender their shares for 
€18.05 per share in cash until an expected  end date of December  13, 2022. If at least 75 percent of 
the shares are tendered, Siemens Energy intends to pursue a delisting of SGRE from the Spanish 
stock exchanges, where it currently trades as a member of the IBEX 35 index. In case of exceeding 
the ownership  threshold of 96.7% of all shares Siemens Energy will pursue a squeeze out of the 
remaining shareholders.

Siemens Energy with solid results and s trong free cash flow due to Gas and Power orders  
 
The order backlog of €97.4 billion reached a new re cord, as orders at Siemens Energy rose 
significantly to €38.3 billion in the fiscal year. This growth was driven mainly by the Gas and Power 
segment, whose strong operational excellence allowed it to manage global supply chain problems 
effectively with cou ntermeasures including building up safety stock to ensure parts availability.  
 
Revenue  decreased by 2.5% on a comparable basis to €29.0 billion,  impacted by a loss of revenue  
in Russia. Growth at Gas and Power however  was more than offset by a decline at SGRE, which 
suffered from challenges ranging from material costs to supply chain issues. On a nominal basis, 
Siemens Energy’s revenue grew by 1.8%.  
 
At the Siemens Energy level full year p rofitability was impacted  by restructuring costs, mostly due to 
the closing of activities in Russia  (roughly €200 million) , and internal restructuring and integration 
costs at SGRE. The f inalization of the restructuring  in Russia  is expected to have no further 
significant financia l impacts.  
 
Adjusted EBITA before Special Items  decreased to €379 million, a significant decrease to the €661 
million achieved in the 2021 fiscal year. While Gas and Power benefited from its turnaround plan 
and saw adjusted EBITA rise sharply, the increase was more than offset by a wider loss at SGRE, due 
to difficulties in the ramp -up of the 5.X onshore platform as well as supply chain delays.  
 
Free cash flow pre tax  continues to be extremely strong, increasing to €1,503 million in the 2022 
fiscal year, above expectations, driven by advance payments f or orders at the Gas and Power 
segment. This high free cash flow has allowed Siemens Energy to pledge €1.15 billion in cash for 
the voluntary cash tender offer for SGRE. This, along with a mandatory convertible bond, has 
reduced the bridge facility for the  offer to  
€2 billion, supporting the company’s commitment of keeping its solid investment grade rating.  
 
The net loss  of Siemens Energy was €647 million including €200 million losses from Russia, 
compared to a loss of €560 million in the prior year. Due t o the widening loss, and the challenges 
facing the company now  and in the coming year, the executive board of Siemens Energy will 
suggest to the Supervisory Board not to propose a dividend for 2022 at its annual shareholder 
meeting in February 2023.

Q4: Strong quarter for Siemens Energy with growth in all segments  
 
In the fourth quarter, Siemens Energy was able to meet unfavorable geopolitical and 
macroeconomic challenges with resilience and operational excellence. The Gas and Power unit once 
again grew in revenue and profit, while SGRE  turned positive thanks to asse t sales, including the 
wind farm development portfolio.  
 
Strong order  growth was once again a highlight. A notable achievement was the Transmission 
business  winning a large order for two grid connections for offshore wind farms in Germany, the 
largest ord er of its kind for Siemens Energy to date. The connection will help Germany achieve its 
goal of increasing its share of renewable energy in the power supply to 80 percent by 2030. This 
shows how Siemens Energy is supplying the infrastructure for the energy  transition.  
 
Revenue  increased in both segments in the fourth quarter, leading to an overall increase of 5.9% on 
a comparable basis to €9.2 billion. Siemens Gamesa’s revenue rose strongly due to disposals . The 
Gas and Power segment saw growth led by the T ransmission and Industrial Applications business. 
The Transmission business grew due to  increased market demand driven by grid stability projects, 
where Siemens Energy is benefiting  from being a market leader, while Industrial Applications saw a 
recovery i n market demand. Both businesses also benefited  from strong  currency  tailwinds . 
 
Adjusted EBITA before special items  at Siemens Energy amounted to €594 million, compared to 
negative €46 million in the Q4 2021.  
 
Maria Ferraro, CFO of Siemens Energy:  “In a difficult environment, we are living up to what we 
promised, step by step. Our transformation is paying off. The Gas and Power segment especially 
demonstrated its ability to execute. Our continued strong free cash flow this year is giving us the 
necessary power to tackle what comes next. High inflation, material costs and supply chain issues 
will not go away in this coming year. We are resilient and well positioned to meet our targets, as 
long as we focus on keeping costs down and operational improvements u p.” 
 
Outlook for fiscal year 2023  
 
Starting in the 2023 fiscal year, Siemens Energy is working in a new operating structure . Adjusted 
EBITA was replaced by Profit, which now excludes the financial result from operations.

Siemens Energy  overall expects comparable revenue growth (excluding currency translation and 
portfolio effects) in fiscal year 2023 in a range of 3% to 7% (ac tual figure FY 2022: negative 2.5%) 
and a profit margin before special items of 2% to 4% (actual figure FY 2022: 1. 2%). Siemens Energy 
also expects a sharp reduction of Net loss compared to fiscal year 2022  (actual figure FY 2022: 
negative €647m). Free cas h flow before taxes is expected to be in a negative range of low - to mid -
triple -digit million (actual figure FY 2022: €1,503m)  
 
 
Siemens Energy will publish its complete Annual Report on December 12, 2022. On the same day 
the Sustainability Report will be published.

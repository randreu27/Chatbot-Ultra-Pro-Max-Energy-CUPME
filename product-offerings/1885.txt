SST-6000  
Steam Turbine Package
Siemens SST-6000 series
A broad range of turbine modules meet individual 
requirements of power ratings and steam parameters. 
The modularized design secures technical replicability. 
For each project, Siemens customizes the turbine 
train and blade path to ensure optimal performance.Preassembled modules reduce coordination 
effort, on-site assembly times, and technical risk. 
Highest reliability and availability are proven by a 
forced outage rate that is less than half the North 
American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) 
average.Overview
Siemens Steam Turbines of the SST-6000 series are 
widely operated in coal-fired steam power plants with 
a power output up to 1,200 MW and an steam turbine 
efficiency up to more than  53.7%.  
Products of the SST-6000 series consist of a high-pres -
sure (HP) turbine, an intermediate-pressure (IP) turbine, 
and up to three low-pressure (LP) turbines for 50 and 60 
Hz.
The SST-6000 is installed as a high-level arrangement 
with down exhaust. Various extractions (up to 10 
stages) are possible for feed water preheating,  
process steam, and district heating.
As of June 2015, 488 units of the Siemens SST-6000 
series are built worldwide.

Customer BenefitsDouble Reheat
On the path to increased efficiency, Siemens double 
reheat technology is one smart step towards achiev -
ing  54.4% efficiency. It is the optimal solution for 
applications used in steam power plants with a power 
output between 1,000 and 1,350 MW.

High-pressure and intermediate-pressure turbine 
modules are delivered to site completely assembled. 
The assembly can also be carried out on-site.
 Fast and simple on-site installation due to pre-
assembled modules.
 Thanks to the modular turbine design, Siemens 
can flexibly respond to project-specific transpor -
tation requirements.
Auxiliaries
Not only the pre-assembled core turbine modules 
but also the provided auxiliary systems are designed 
for maximum customer value:
Lube oil system, seal oil system, seal steam system , 
evacuation system, hydrogen system, and additional 
systems.**Estimated values (base load)

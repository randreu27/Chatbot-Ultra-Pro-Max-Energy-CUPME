Section 5: Compressor Crankcase Oil System 
 
5-1. Frame Oil Recommendations 
 
General Requirements 
 
The oil must be well-refined petroleum product with low ca rbon residue. It should not contain fats or fixed 
oil compounding. Oil containing rust and oxidat ion inhibitors and a foam depressant is highly 
recommended. The oil selected must be substantially non-corrosive to the common bearing metals, with a 
pour point at least 10°F below ambient temperature when the unit is started for engine drives. The 
Compressor Cylinder and Packing Lubrication System on new units is designed at the factory based upon 
the specific application. In most cases, the system is  designed to draw lubricating oil from the compressor 
crankcase to supply the lubricator pumps unless there are specific reasons why a different type lubricating 
oil is required for the cylinders. Packager should define  on the Distributor Order Form where they wish to 
obtain the oil supply to the lubricator. (See Compre ssor Cylinder and Packing Lubrication Guidelines.) 
 
Multiviscosity lubricants may be used in the crankc ase where widely variable ambient temperatures are 
encountered, provided that the lubricant maintains a viscosity of 115 to 150 SSU (23.7 to 31.8 cSt) at 
normal operating sump temperature. Provision must  be made to heat the crankcase oil to minimum 
starting temperatures as outlined in 5-5 Oil Parameter Recommendations.   
 It is recognized that the oil recommended by the en gine manufacturer (when an engine drive is supplied) 
is normally heavier (in the SAE 40 visc osity range). When this is the case and the user desires to stock 
only one oil for use in both the engine and compressor  crankcases, the heavier weight oil recommended 
for the engine may also be used in the compressor cran kcase. Under cold ambient starting conditions, it 
is recommended that the oil sump temperature be at least 10°F (5.6°C) to 20°F (2.8°C) above the pour 
point prior to starting the engine drives. This ma y require the use of auxilia ry crankcase heaters. 
 
If sump oil temperatures are 5°F (2.8°C) higher than the allowable maximum sump temperature for a 
specific viscosity, the lubricant should be monitored mo re closely for nitration effects and more frequent oil 
changes should be scheduled to prevent an increase in long term maintenance programs.

Inspection 
 Conduct all testing of the lubricating oil in accord ance with the Standard Methods (latest edition) of the 
American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM).  
 Oil Change Schedule 
 
The oil should be changed every 2000 to 4000 hours , or every 6 months , depending on local conditions, 
or as indicated by oil analysis. Most reputable o il companies offer laboratory analysis services of oil 
samples on request. We highly recommend the use of this type service. A once-a-month analysis 
schedule is recommended when the compressor is operated under severe conditions. 
 
Where the compressor is operated in an extremel y dirty atmosphere, installed outdoors, operated 
intermittently, handling foul gas or where the oil reaches  high temperatures in a very hot atmosphere, it 
may be necessary to change the oil more often.  In case of dirty atmosphere, consider using sweeping 
nitrogen purge in crankcase.  
 
Dry Sump Requirements  
 
Any requirements outside these limit ations require an auxiliary oil pump and a deep independent oil sump 
within the package.

5-2.  Oil Cooler and Filter 
 
All units have frame mounted oil filters that are insta lled at the factory and should not be removed for any 
reason. These filters are normally mounted off the o il pump end of the compressor; alternate locations 
may be used to suit a particular installation. Filter  internals should be checked for cleanliness and correct 
positioning. Piping connections to the cooler and filter  must line up properly before they are tightened. Do 
not spring the piping to make connections, as this may cause leaking joints or resu lt in fatigue failures.  
 
Some customers require duplex type oil filters. In these instances, Siemens Energy recommends the 
original frame mounted filter be left in place. Afte r 200 hours of run time, the element should be removed 
and continue flowing through the empty filter housing.  This ensures the oil system has removed any 
contaminants which may have been introdu ced during the packaging of the unit. 
 
5-3.  Oil Piping 
 The oil piping in the frame lubrication system downstream of the cooler to the filter must be 
closely examined and cleaned before charging the system with oil. 
 Where the customer is supply ing external oil piping, it is his respon sibility to provide piping that has been 
thoroughly cleaned and completely examined throughout. Any foreign material loosened by the flow of oil 
through the piping can seriously damage the compressor.  All external oil piping that is supplied by the 
customer should be the same size as the connec tion on the frame. The piping size should NEVER be 
stepped down for any reason. 
 
Any check valves included in the oil system shoul d be flapper type FULL flow check valves. A piston 
check should NEVER be used since th is can act as a restriction. Any type restriction ca n cause severe 
damage to the frame internals.

5-4.  Prelube Pumps 
 Prelube pumps are required on frames that are driven by  an electric motor or whenever the compressor 
may start-up while unattended. These prelube pumps ma y be electric or pneumatic driven, but require a 
permissive which will disable the start-up sequence if  oil pressure is below 10 lbs. (0.70 kg/cm
2). This is 
the normal range, but some applications may require a different permissive set point due to specifics of 
that machine; ie, across-the line starts at full speed. The prelube pump should be sized for the minimum 
recommended flow rates listed below for each frame model.  
Recommended minimum prelube capacity @35 psi (2.46 kg/cm

If a hand pre-lube pump is installed, it should have a flapper type check valve installed in the 
outlet.

Connecting weak or unstable grids
Control load flow and provide 
reactive power
Decouple grids regardless of 
frequency, voltage and quality
Bridge the distance
Install compact cost-efficient medium-voltage 
DC connections via cable or compact OHLs
CO/two.fitted Reduction, e.g. by reducing 
diesel generators
Increase power infeed
Enable greater power transfer 
in existing infrastructures
Improve grid stability with 
STATCOM functionality
Reduce footprint
MV level allows lower lines below treetops
MV lines with smaller corridors and 
wood polesor simple structures
Obtain transmission autonomy in 
power ranges up to 150MW
Establish direct MVDC transmission 
links and additional grid nodesAbbreviations: AC  Alternating Current,
DC Direct Current, MV Medium Voltage,

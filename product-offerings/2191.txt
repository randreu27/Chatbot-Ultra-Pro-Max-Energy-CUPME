  Edition 11/2015   
   Manufacturer’s or Supplier’s Certification for Capacitors 
- Electric Double Layer (EDLC) or Asymmetric - 
with an energy storage capacity greater than 0.3 Wh   
also in a module and/or installed in equipment (see UN 3499 or UN 3508)1 
according to the dangerous goods regulations of the different transport modes2  
 
Capacitor product name: 
 
The capacitor is  
    an EDLC (not asymmetric,  see UN 3499)    an asymmetric capacitor (see UN 3508) 
 
Energy Storage capacity of the single capacitor:           __________________ Wh 
   The capacitor contains no  electrolyte  to be classified as dangerous goods. 
 The capacitor contains an electrolyte  to be classified as dangerous good and is  
 - designed to withstand a 95 kPa pressure differential 
 - capable of withstanding a 1.2 m drop test unpackaged on an unyielding (rigid, non-resilient, flat and  
   horizontal) surface without loss of contents in the case of  
             a) an EDLC with an energy storage capacity of 10 Wh or less or 
  b) an asymmetric capacitor with an energy storage capacity of 20 Wh or less. 
   Each capacitor is  
 - marked with its energy storage capacity in Wh 
 - designed and constructed to safely relieve pressure that may build up in use, through a vent or a weak  
   point in the capacitor casing. Any liquid which is released upon venting  will be contained by  
    the packaging  
    the equipment in which the capacitor is installed.  
 
 Capacitors as described are contained in a module (module name):    __________________________ 
For the module:    Additional dangerous goods are contained in the module as given per attachment.   
   No additional dangerous goods component is contained in the module. 
  The module/s as given above is/are installed in the following equipment: 
 
         _____________________________ (name of the equipment)   
 
For equipment:      Additional dangerous goods are contained in the equipment as given per attachment  
   No additional dangerous goods component is contained in the equipment.

General instructions concerning the taking of oil samples  
(See also Installation instruction TUMA 105.03)  
One liter of oil is required for an oil test; suitable sample bottles may be borrowed from 
your local Siemens Energy Partner . 
For oil gas analysis, one liter of oil is required  
• Tap-off point for oil gas analysis: normally top of tank  
• Tap-off point for other tests: normally bottom of tank  
 
1. Use clean 1- liter bottles with gas -tight closure to hold the sample.  
2. Special aluminum bottles with plastic screw caps are generally used. The sample bottles 
must close so tightly that no air can be drawn in during cooling.  
3. If glass bottles are used, the oil sample should not be drawn off unless you are sure that the temperature of the sample is higher than or equal to the storage or dispatch temperature. If 
not, please consult the test laboratory.  
4. Samples for gas analysis should always be taken using the overflow method. The operations as described under 5 and 7 below should be carried out quickly and without 
interruption to prevent the sample from coming into contact with the atmosphere as far as 
possible.  
5. Method of drawing oil from the oil sample tap (Fig. 1). Screw onto the tap a coupling 
element with seal, hose fitting and oil -proof hose (30 to 50 cm long). Stuffing box has to be 
unfastened  in advance. Turn the tap on and fill the outer vessel with 2 to 3 liters of oil (from 
the outlet pipe). Insert the hose in the bottle so that its end is just short of the bottom of the bottle. Turn the tap on and fill the bottle from the bottom upwards, s lowly at first and then 
quickly until two or three times the content of the bottle have overflowed into the outer 
vessel. Finally, reduce the flow from the tap and, with oil still flowing, pull the bottle 
downwards off the hose. Seal the bottle immediately . After this, oil sample valve and 
stuffing box have to be closed again.  
6. Dispose the oil in the outer vessel in the proper way.

Munich, Germany, November 10 , 2021 – Siemens Energy today announced its results for the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2021 that ended 
September  30, 2021.  
Solid finish to the fiscal  year  with strong orders and cash flow  
„I'm pleased with our first full fiscal year performance as a stand -alone company and we delivered a solid fourth quarter with strong orders and 
cash  flow . The team did an excellent job and laid th e foundation for our transformation in a challenging market environment and I am particularly 
pleased with our progress in the Gas and Power segment where we improved our operational profitability. Siemens Energy has posted a net loss 
primarily due to the planned restructuring measures and the delayed turnaround of the onshore business of Siemens Gamesa  Renewable Energy . 
Looking forward, we will continue to focus on our plan to increase profitability which puts us on track to achieve our mid -term targets ”, says 
Christian Bruch, President and CEO  of Siemens Energy AG . 
Q4 Fiscal Year 2021  
• Increase in orders of 30.2% to €9.1bn due to exceptional  quarterly order development at Gas and Power (GP)  and a significant  increase at 
Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) . 
• Revenue growth  of 7.4% to € 8.2bn driven by strong quarterly performance in both segments leading to a book-to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to 
revenue) of 1.11. 
• Mainly due to a loss at SGRE, Adjusted EBITA before special items for Siemens Energy was negative  with € 46m (Q 4 FY 2020: positive  €70m). The 
recent quarter was impacted by total special items of € 281m (Q4 FY 2020 : €402m) particularly related to GP’s competitiveness  program . Thus , 
Adjusted EBITA of Siemens Energy came in wit h negative €327m compared to negative € 332m in prior year -quarter . 
• Net loss amounted to  €383m, compared to a loss in the prior -year quarter of € 390m. Corresponding basic earnings per share (EPS) were negative  €0.43.  
• Free cash flow pre tax rose by 39.9% to €985m year -over -year  with strong develop ment  in the quarter.  
Fiscal Year 2021  
• Despite  a moderate decrease of 2.9% to €33.0bn (FY 2020: €34.0bn), orders of Siemens Energy remained on a strong level ; on a comparable basis  
(excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) , orders declined  only slightly by 0.5% . Order backlog at fiscal ye ar-end grew  to €83.8bn. 
• Revenue moderately increased by 3. 7% to €28.5bn (FY 2020: €27.5bn) driven by  growth in both segments ; on a comparable basis, revenue rose 
clearly  by 6.0% . 
• Adjusted EBITA for Siemens Energy nearly reached break even  with negative €12m  (FY 2020: loss of €1 ,543m) because of  sharply lower special items 
and operational improvements. Adjusted EBITA before special items improved to  €661m (FY 2020: negative €17m) with a margin of 2.3%. 
• Net loss of fiscal year 2021 amounted to €560m, sharp ly improve d compared to the  loss in the prior  year  of €1, 859m. Corresponding basic 
earnings per share (EPS) were negative  €0.63  (FY 2020: negative €2.21) . 
• Free cash flow pre tax of Siemens Energy considerably exceeded our initial expectation  and climbed by 39.1% to €1,358m (FY 2020: €977m) . 
• In light of the favorable development, especially the strong cash flow, Siemens Energy proposes a dividend of €0 .10 per share . 
Fiscal Year 202 2 
• For Siemens Energy in fiscal year 2022, we expect comparable revenue development  to be in a range of negative 1% to positive 3% and an 
Adjusted EBITA margin before special items of 3% to 5%.Earnings Release

 • Orders increased  substantially year -over -year. A sharp growth at GP 
was accompanied by  a significant in crease  at SGRE. Growth in b oth 
segments was driven by a higher volume of  large orders compared 
to prior -year quarter.  
• Revenue in  GP posted significant growth, SGRE was in line  with a 
comparatively high prior -year figure.  
• Service revenue came in clearly  above  the prior -year quarter.  
• Book -to-bill ratio was well above 1 , mainly driven by GP. Order back-
log was €83.8bn, slightly above prior quarter’s level . 
• Adjusted EBITA improved  slightly  compared to prior -year quarter . 
While  GP posted a sharp increase , adjusted EBITA of SGRE decreased . 
• Special items substantiall y decreased  on declines of stand -alone 
costs and strategic portfolio decisions . Restructuring costs were 
mainly related to GP’s competitiveness program and amounted to 
€230m, sharply above the prior -year  quarter ’s level.  
• Adjusted EBITA before special items and corresponding margin of Sie-
mens Energy decreased  year -over -year  as the improvement at GP 
could not offset a loss at SGRE . 
• Net loss and corresponding negative basic EPS  decreased  only 
slightly  compared to prior -year quarter  as the improvement was held 
back by the profit development at  SGRE.  
• Free cash flow pre tax exceeded  the high prior -year quarter’s level 
driven by  the sharp increase at  SGRE . 
• During the quarter, provisions for pensions and similar obligations 
decreased from € 867m as of June  30, 202 1 to €830m as of Septem-
ber 30, 2021 .

 • Orders in the GP segment rose sharp ly compared to prior -year quar-
ter with growth across all businesses . Therefore, Q4 posted the high-
est quarterly order figure of the fiscal year driven by a  sharply  in-
creased volume of large orders . The growth  was led by  the Asia, 
Australia region which doubled orders year -over -year mainly due to 
several large orders at Generation. Furthermore, Transmission  won 
three large o rders in the USA and Germany totaling nearly  €900m.  
• Revenue significantly  increased year-over -year, also with growth 
across all businesses . 
• Service revenue moderately  increased compared to the prior -year  
quarter . 
• Book -to-bill ratio of GP came in at 1 .16, resulting in an order backlog 
at quarter -end of €5 1.4bn, slightly above prior quarter -end’s level . 
• Adjusted EBITA and corresponding margin sharply improved year-
over -year  due to operational improvements . 
• Impacts from special items were nearly on the high prior -year quar-
ter’s level primarily due to restructuring costs which mainly relate to  
the agreement with the Works Council concerning workforce reduc-
tions in Germany . In total, severance costs in the recen t quarter were 
at €222m.  
• Adjusted EBITA before special items and corresponding margin 
sharply increased year -over -year.  
• Free cash flow pre tax was sharply below the high basis of compari-
son with prior -year quarter . For the full year,  Free cash flow pre tax 
more than doubled year-over -year  supported by ongoing asset man-
agement  initiatives .

 • Orders  in the SGRE segment significantl y increased in comparison to 
prior -year quarter  mainly due to  a higher  volume from large orders  
including new contracts worth  more than €1bn  for offshore wind 
farm s including service in the USA. The resulting growth in the Amer-
icas reporting region more than  offset a decrease in the Asia, Aus-
tralia region.  
• Revenue was nearly on prior -year quarter’s level. G rowth in the ser-
vice business  offset an onshore decline . 
• Book -to-bill ratio of SGRE came in at  1.01, leading to a n order backlog 
of €32.5bn at fiscal year -end.  
• Adjusted EBITA was sharply down compared to prior -year quarter 
mainly d riven by onshore project burdens  of €69m with regard to  5.X 
platform projects mainly in Northern Europe. An additional impact  
resulted from manufacturing ramp -up costs of the SG 11.0 -200 DD 
offshore platform . This was partly offset by sharply lower negative 
special items . 
• Impacts from special items more than halved year -over -year and pri-
marily consisted of integration costs related to IT topics and the ac-
quisition of the Senvion business.  
• Free cash flow pre tax sharp ly improved year -over -year benefit ting 
from early project payments as well as asset management achieve-
ments primarily with regard to receivables .

5 Outlook
We expect the global economy to continue to grow in the coming year and note that global supply chain constraints are likely to persist. Therefore , 
we cannot exclude that a shortage of mat erials and components and/or a lack of freight capacity may have an impact on our business, especially 
as it pertains to the on -time execution of large projects. COVID -19 also remains a factor of uncertainty. However,  we believe the overall situation 
will remain  stable and do not expect major negative impacts on our business activity from COVID -19. Overall , we are confident that the measures 
we have taken as part of our transformation will lead to higher profitability at Siemens Energy in fiscal year 2022.  
For Siemens Energy  in fiscal year 202 2, we expect comparable revenue development (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) to be 
in a range of negative 1%  to positive 3% (Actual figure FY 2021: 6.0%) and an Adjusted EBITA margin before special  items of 3% to 5%  (Actual figure 
FY 2021: 2. 3%). We expect a sharp improvement towards our target of positive  Net income (Actual figure FY 2021: Net loss of €5 60m). We expect 
Free cash flow pre tax  to be in a range of a positive mid-triple -digit million  € (Actual figure FY 2021: €1 ,358m). 
For the GP segment  in fiscal year 2022,  we target comparable  revenue growth to be in a range of 1% to 5 % (Actual figure FY 2021: 4.1%) and 
Adjusted  EBITA marg in before special  items to be between 4.5% and 6.5 % (Actual figure FY 2021: 4.6%) . 
For the  SGRE segment , we expect in fiscal year 2022 a comparable  decline of revenue between  negative 2 % and negative 7 % (Actual figure FY 
2021: growth of 9.0%) . Adjusted EBITA margin before special items is expected to be in a range of 1% to 4% (Actual figure FY 2021: negative 1.0 %). 
This guidance assume s no major  financial impact s from C OVID -19 on our business activity  and excludes charges related to legal and regulatory 
matters.

InternalA joint statement of T&D equipment manufacturers
The recently published 6thIntergovernmental Panel onClimate Change (IPCC) report shows the
seriousness ofthe climate crisis .Human activity ischanging the climate inunprecedented and
sometimes irreversible ways .The electrical transmission and distribution (T&D) industry has an
opportunity toleadsociety’s response todeliver infrastructures that are targeting climate -neutral
objective tounderpin thetransition tonetzero emission economies .
The clean transport oflow-carbon electricity isanessential element ofnational decarbonization plans,
which willunderpin thesustainable economies ofthefuture .Inconjunction with decarbonized power
generation using renewable energy sources, itisvital todothesame forT&D power grids upon which
thesystem relies .
Forover 50years, therecognized insulation and switching performance aswell asproven and stable
characteristics ofSF6have contributed tothereliability, efficiency, and resilience ofpower network
facilities, enabling compact equipment forallvoltage classes .However, because SF6has aglobal
warming potential over 25,000 times greater than CO2,action isnow required toachieve truly
sustainable power grids .Toenable this change, weneed tolimit theSF6emissions and install new
electrical equipment using clean reliable andnon-toxic alternatives .
Asequipment manufacturers, weembrace ourresponsibility tosociety and arefully committed tothenet
zero goal.Each oftheundersigned has already developed orisintheprocess ofdeveloping T&D
equipment completely free offluorinated gases .The phase -outoffluorinated and PFAS -gases (per-and
polyfluoroalkyl substances) inelectrical T&D equipment, where alternatives are available, would
accelerate progress toward amore sustainable future .
Each oftheundersigned iscommitted todelivering T&D equipment free offluorinated -gasandPFAS -gas
needed toenable thistransition .The firstF-gasfree products aresuccessfully inoperation, and each of
thesigning companies iscommitted toclose theremaining portfolio gaps intheupcoming years inorder
todeliver onscience -based netzero targets (SBTI) that companies aresetting .These products willhelp
deliver ourown company health andclimate commitments while enabling environmental improvements .
You arewelcome tojoinindelivering thisambition and building truly sustainable clean power grids fora
climate -neutral future .
The undersigned willcontinue todevelop, manufacture, sell, and service independently .This statement shall innoway create
anyjoint responsibility orliability oranyform ofcooperation orjoint venture .

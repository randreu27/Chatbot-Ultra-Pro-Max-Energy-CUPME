“The solid performance ofGas and Power (GP) shows that
wemake progress with ourtransformation .Our measures
have started tohave animpact, and theresults areheading
intheright direction .However, thelatest profit warning at
Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) isasetback
and disappointing for all shareholders .As majority

appropriate measures toachieve the turnaround inthe
onshore business” ,said Christian Bruch .
Given itssolid performance GPiswellontrack toachieve its
targets forthisyear and next.However, SGRE has been
impacted more than expected byasupply chain constraints
and challenges with theramp upofthe5.Xonshore wind
turbine and cutitsrevenue and margin guidance forthe

Due tothebusiness development ofSGRE intherecent quarter anditsadjusted guidance, weamended theoutlook forthefiscal

positive 8.5%.
Ourassessment forSiemens Energy’s business environment remains unchanged andweconfirm GPsegment’s outlook forfiscal
year 2022 .Global economy should continue togrow infiscal year 2022 andweexpect global supply chain constraints topersist

capacity may continue tohave animpact onourbusiness, especially asitpertains totheon-time execution oflarge projects .
Nevertheless, wearestillconfident thatthemeasures wehave taken aspartofourtransformation –especially atGP–willlead to
higher profitability atSiemens Energy infiscal year 2022 ,although onalower than expected level.

effects) tobeinarange ofnegative 2%topositive 3%andanAdjusted EBITA margin before special items between positive 2%
andpositive 4%.Westillexpect asharp improvement ofNetincome andFree cash flowpretaxtobeinarange ofapositive mid-
triple -digit million €.

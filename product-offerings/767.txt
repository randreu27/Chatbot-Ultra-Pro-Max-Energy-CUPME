Overview
Key strengths Key risks 
Strong technological capabilities and market-leading 
positions.Large project exposure, which translates into volatile 
cash flows and exposes the group to a variety of project-
related execution risks, as seen in the wind turbine 
segment,
Good geographical diversity with a large installed base 
and increasing share of services (about 40% of orders).Operating performance is held back by Siemens Gamesa 
Renewable Energy S.A. (SGRE), which is still in 
restructuring and is expected to remain loss-making until 
fiscal year 2026 (ends Sept. 30, 2026). 
Good long-term growth fundamentals, considering 
exposure to the energy sector, especially renewables and 
grid technologies. Weak profitability compared with peers in the capital 
goods sector, with S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA 
margins of less than 5%-historically.
High order back-log of about €123 billion provides sound 
topline visibility over the next two to three years.Free operating cash flow (FOCF) generation is largely 
driven by positive working capital inflows, which will 
moderate if order intake dynamics normalize.

The Trump administration's recent decision to suspend new federal offshore wind leasing will 
have only a limited effect on Siemens Energy. Off-shore wind park projects have long lead 
times, from auction to construction, which means zero-to-minor consequences for the Business risk:

company over the next two-to-three years as we understand that awarded projects will still be 
honored and built. Over the longer term, however, the decision will likely influence global 
demand and potentially pricing for offshore wind turbines but more toward 2028. At the same 
time, the European offshore market is much larger and is aiming to increase capacity to more 
than 100 GW by 2030 versus the 30 GW the previous U.S. administration had targeted by the 
same year. We therefore believe demand for offshore turbines will remain high, although wind 
turbine manufacturers might expand capacity less then currently planned. Siemens Energy also 
provides conventional power generation and grid connections (also for data centers), which are 
likely to benefit from the policy directions of the new U.S. administration.
We expect Siemens Energy's profitability will sustainably improve its EBITDA margin to more 
than 7% over the next 12-24 months. Following the conventional power business' strong 
operating performance, and given there are no additional charges for SGRE, the group reached 
S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA of more than €1.6 billion (a margin of 4.6%) in fiscal 2024, 
about double the amount of about €700 million (2.0%-2.5% EBITDA margin) we had initially 
anticipated when we revised the outlook to negative in November 2023. With the gradual 
turnaround of SGRE and the strong and higher margin order intake in its conventional power 
business, we now expect EBITDA margins will continue to gradually improve to around 7.0% in 
fiscal 2025, approaching a margin profile that corresponds to the current rating level and which 
should enable the group to generate FOCF on a sustainable basis, to about 10%-11% EBITDA 
margin by fiscal 2026.
SGRE's improving but still weak operating performance should reduce the burden on 
profitability for the group over time. We believe Siemens Energy has identified all major issues 
at SGRE and has addressed its key problems. That said, currently sales of SGRE's 5.X turbines 
are suspended (relaunch is expected during 2025), which weakens SGRE's competitive position.

costs, no additional quality concerns in its onshore operations, and the progress in ramping up 
its offshore operations, SGRE will continue to gradually improve its profitability. This should lead 
to neutral to positive EBITDA from fiscal 2026. EBITDA will remain negative in fiscal 2025 but 
less so than in fiscal 2024.
The grid technology and gas services segments are driving Siemens Energy's increased order 
intake and improved operating performance. The group's order backlog increased to €123 
billion as of Sept. 30, 2024 (equal to about four years' worth of revenue) --from €112 billion at the 
end of fiscal 2023--and provides sound revenue growth prospects over the next 24 months and 
thereafter. Both benefited from higher volumes that resulted from large orders for new units 
and higher-margin service contracts. We understand that, given the strong demand, new orders 
carry a higher margin, leading to improved gross margins in its backlog and higher profitability 
over time. However, order book growth has been limited by the significant decline in SGRE 
orders, which resulted from the temporary sales suspension of SGRE's 4.X and 5.X onshore 
turbines. We note a material step up for SGRE in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, in which it has 
reported a book-to-bill ratio of more than 1.0x.  We expect this more dynamic order intake to 
continue at SGRE over the next 24 months, supported by strong demand for offshore wind 
turbines.  With released preliminary figures for the first quarter indicating an ongoing high order 
intake and revenue momentum, we  now forecast group revenue to grow by about 10% in fiscal 
2025 and 10%-12% in fiscal 2026.
Siemens Energy has already adapted its product offering to the global energy transition, 
providing a sound base load of new orders, but competitive pressure remains high. We 
continue to view the longer-term prospects of the wind turbine industry as favorable because 
wind energy is a cornerstone of the global energy transition. In particular, we expect new 
offshore wind installations, where SGRE holds the leading position, will increase by 10% to 12% 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024020406080100120140Bil. €Order Backlog

annually until 2030. We therefore believe SGRE's order intake will increase, especially in the 
offshore segment. However, permit procedures and grid connections limit the order intake. The 
rise in installed base share will increase service contribution and margins, while also improving 
cash conversion. That said, competition remains high and limits Siemens Energy's ability to 
increase prices significantly.
FOCF will remain positive over the next 24 months thanks to ongoing working capital inflows, 
despite provision payouts and higher capital expenditure (capex) needs. Siemens Energy has 
been able to generate positive FOCF since it was spun off in 2020. However, this has been 
largely driven by working capital inflows, thanks to advanced payments relating to new 
equipment orders. With a high order intake dynamic, the group's order backlog of about €80 
billion in 2020 increased to about €123 billion as of September 2024. Hence, contract liabilities 
increased to €19 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, from €15.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2023, and 
about €10 billion in 2020. That said, higher order intakes and revenue require more investments 
in working capital, such as inventories. Still, the group was able to generate more than €6 billion 
in working capital inflows over 2020-2024. We expect order intake dynamics to continue leading 
to more than €1 billion in working capital inflows per year over the next two years. This will yield 
positive FOCF generation in fiscal 2025 of up to €500 million and more than €1 billion in fiscal 
2026 despite higher capex of €2.0 billion-€2.3 billion annually (5%-6% of revenue) and material 
provision payouts related to quality issues at SGRE of about €1 billion over the next 24 months. 
If unexpected order intake dynamics slow--demonstrated, for example, by a book-to-bill ratio of 
1x or below--working capital will likely turn negative given the lack of further increasing 
advanced payments pressuring FOCF. Excluding any effects from working capital or provisions, 
we estimate that the group would require an EBITDA margin of more than 7% to generate 
neutral to slightly positive FOCF. We expect the group will approach this level in fiscal 2025 and 
reach it comfortably in fiscal 2026.

Strong balance sheet with a net cash position is providing some leeway until a sustainable 
adjusted EBITDA margin of 7% is reached. We note that management remains strongly 
committed to protect the investment-grade rating. We expect a prudent financial policy, with no 
material acquisitions or shareholder-friendly actions and the maintenance of a very solid 
liquidity position. Our expectation is supported by the group's disposals of noncore assets 
worth about €3 billion, which ensured a net cash position in fiscal 2024. With the now-better 
operating performance and higher expectation of FOCF generation we also estimate a net cash 
position in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026.
Outlook
The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the group will sustainably improve its S&P 
Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA margin to more than 7% in the next 12-24 months. It also 
reflects our view that Siemens Energy has sufficient financial resources and liquidity to execute 
the ongoing transition. We also expect that the group will generate positive FOCF and maintain 
low to zero leverage, including an S&P Global Ratings-adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio well below 
1x and funds from operations (FFO)-to-debt ratio above 60%.
Downside scenario
We could lower the rating if:
•Siemens Energy's EBITDA margins do not sustainably improve to more than 7%.
•FFO to debt falls below 60% and debt to EBITDA increases to above 1.0x.
•The group is likely to generate sustainably negative FOCF.
•We see further significant asset impairments or project losses emerge.2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025f 2026f-1500-1000-5000500100015002000

•SGRE's restructuring is delayed, leading to higher cash outflows or a reduction of earnings 
expectations.
•We see a material deviation from our base case, for example in the form of a weaker 
performance of the group's former gas and power business.
Upside scenario
We could raise the rating if Siemens Energy establishes a multi-year track record of performing 
in line with its business plan and our base-case including:
•S&P Global Ratings-adjusted EBITDA margins improving to about 10%.
•A track record of reduced earnings volatility and no new significant project charges. 
•FOCF to revenue consistently above 2% of revenue, excluding working capital inflows to strip 
out the effect from advanced payments from new equipment orders.
•Maintaining a strong balance sheet, including S&P Global Ratings-adjusted debt to EBITDA of 
less than 1.0x and FFO to debt above 60%.
Our Base-Case Scenario
.
Assumptions
•With the release of preliminary quarterly results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we have slightly revised up our 
base case. 
•Revenue growth of around 10%in fiscal 2025 because of reduced SGRE revenue but supported by strong growth in 
grid technologies and transformation of industry. 
•For fiscal 2026 we expect 10%-12% on the back of continued strong momentum in the conventional energy segments 
and normalizing SGRE sales, as well as on successful capacity expansions. 
•Adjusted EBITDA margins to further recover to 6.9% to 7.5% in fiscal 2025, from 4.6% in fiscal 2024, on the back of a 
rebound in volumes at SGRE, productivity gains, and reducing restructuring costs. EBITDA margins will be mainly 
driven by the conventional power business, which delivers a 10%-11% margin before special items. Furthermore, we 
expect the benefits of cost control and inflation protection measures will continue in 2025.
•Adjusted EBITDA margins to improve to 10%-11% in fiscal 2026 on the back of strong volume growth and momentum 
in grid technology. SGRE's profitability, which we expect will turn positive, will contribute significantly to the margin 
improvement.
•Over the past two years, Siemens Energy has successfully managed its working capital, although a good part of this 
was via the collection of advanced payments. Also, inventories have risen due to inflation. We believe some inventory 
build-up was necessary in case of supply chain disruptions. For fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026, we believe Siemens 
Energy will continue its careful working capital management and expect working capital inflows will continue in fiscal 
2027.
•Annual capex of €2.0 billion-€2.3 billion in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026, before normalizing to below €2.0 billion from 
2027.
•Dividend payments in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 limited to minorities.
•No material acquisitions over the next 24 months.

Peer Comparison
GE Vernova (GEV) is the closest peer to Siemens Energy. GEV was spun off from General Electric 
in early 2024. Similar to Siemens Energy, the company designs and services products that 
generate, transfer, orchestrate, convert, and store electricity. It operates across three 
operating segments, namely power, wind, and electrification (grid solutions, power conversion, 
solar, and storage solutions). GEV has leading market positions in gas turbines globally and 
onshore wind turbines in North America. In terms of onshore wind turbines, GEV maintains a 
strong installed base, with a leading position in the U.S. As of first half of 2024, the company had 
120 gigawatts (GW) of installed onshore wind capacity, with over 60% in its domestic market. 
Overall GEV has higher exposure to conventional power generation while Siemens Energy has 
higher exposure to grid infrastructure investments (see chart below). Both Siemens Energy and 
GEV's business risk profile are constrained by low and volatile profitability, showcasing the risks 
related to large project execution risks. We expect GEV will maintain its low indebtedness, along 
with a sizable cash balance, resulting in a net cash position over the next 24 months.2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024**-10-505101520%

Business Risk
Our business risk assessment is supported by Siemens Energy's no. 1 and 2 positions in its 
markets. Siemens Energy is market leader in transmission and second largest in the power 
generation and oil and gas sector. Due to its comprehensive product offering, Siemens Energy 
can provide integral power generation and energy supply solutions, including related services, 
globally. Overall, one-sixth of global electricity production is based on Siemens Energy's 
technology. We view positively the group's order book of about €123 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, 
and its large installed base of more than 90,000 units globally. Siemens Energy benefits from 
significant geographical, product, and customer diversification, a strong technology base, and 
its leading positions in relatively concentrated markets, which mainly result from the group's 
expertise and technological know-how.
An inherent feature of the group is its exposure to large projects, which translates into more 
volatile cash flows and exposure to several project-related execution risks. Overall, the 
significant share of service revenues and cash flows from the group's generation and industrial 
applications divisions, as well as increasing service revenue at SGRE, partly mitigate the 
volatility related to these large projects.
We assess the group's profitability as below average, compared with the wider capital goods 
sector. Siemens Energy's adjusted EBITDA margins turned positive to 4.6% in fiscal 2024 from 
negative 5.6% in fiscal year 2023, during which it had primarily suffered from project execution 
mistakes and quality issues at SGRE. Historically profit margins have also been held back by its 
conventional power business, which has been successfully restructured and is now partly 
offsetting SGRE’s weak operating performance. However, with the gradual turnaround of its 
onshore wind turbine business and the full integration of SGRE, we continue to expect margins 
to improve to about 6.9%-7.5% in fiscal year 2025 and further improve to 10.0%-11.0% in fiscal 
year 2026 on the back of continued strong momentum in the conventional energy segments and 
normalizing SGRE sales, as well as on successful capacity expansions. The positive trend in 
profitability is further supported by the strength of the gas and power business, and SGRE's 
cost control and inflation protection measures.
Financial Risk
Our assessment of Siemens Energy's financial risk profile is supported by the group's 
conservative financial policy and strong balance sheet. We anticipate that the group will 
maintain a net cash position on the back of Siemens Energy's asset disposals and higher cash 
generation overall. We also incorporate the group's exposure to large project execution risks 
and its high advanced payments, resulting in volatile FOCF. Overall, we consider Siemens 
www.spglobal.com/ratingsdirect January 29, 2025       11Siemens Energy
Energy's financial policy to be conservative and in line with an investment-grade rating. We do 
not anticipate any additional transactions that could alter the group's credit metrics.
We understand that there is a strong commitment by management to maintain an 
investment-grade rating. The group reported a cash balance of about €6.3 billion at fiscal year-
end 2024 (of which we assume about €5.8 billion or 90% is always available for debt service) and 
financial debt of about €2.0 billion, excluding reported operating lease liabilities of about €1.7 
billion. We add about €388 million in pension obligations and about €30 million in guarantees to 
our adjusted debt calculation. Siemens Energy has €4.0 billion in undrawn liquidity lines at its 
disposal. The group's dividend policy incorporates 40%-60% of adjusted net earnings paid out 
annually. We understand dividend payments are halted on the back of conditions under the 
German government-backed guarantee facility. We also understand that Siemens Energy plans 
to resume dividend distributions when the turnaround of SGRE has progressed further.

Liquidity
We view Siemens Energy's liquidity as strong, reflecting our expectations that liquidity sources 
will exceed uses by more than 1.5x over the 12 months from Sept. 30, 2024, and remain above 
1.0x over the subsequent 12 months. We expect liquidity sources will exceed uses even if EBITDA 
declines by 30%.
hidden_sbs0809048e9cec4341a032f0b252e9b3a7
Principal liquidity sources
Principal liquidity sources over the 24 months from Sept. 30, 2024, include:
•Cash and cash equivalents of about €6.3 billion;
•€4.0 billion in fully undrawn committed revolving credit facility, maturing 
in February 2029;
•Cash FFO of €730 million-€830 million over the next 12 months from 
Sept. 30, 2024, and more than €1.6 billion over the subsequent 12 
months; and
•Working capital inflows of up to €1.3 billion.Principal liquidity uses
Principal liquidity uses over the same period include:
•Short-term debt maturities of about €160 million over the 12 months from 
Sept 30, 2024, and about €1.1 billion over the subsequent 12 months;
•Intra-year seasonal working capital fluctuations of up to €1.0 billion;
•Annual capex of €2.0 billion-€2.3 billion; and
•No meaningful dividend payments and share repurchases.

Covenant Analysis
Requirements
The capital structure does not contain any covenants.
Environmental, Social, And Governance
ESG factors have an overall neutral influence on our credit rating analysis of Siemens Energy. 
The group's operations comprise conventional power generation and industrial applications, 
including oil and gas activities, that are prone to energy transition risks and account for about 
50% of revenues. Power transmission and renewable energy solutions via SGRE contribute the 
other half of revenues. The group has set ambitious targets to decarbonize across the value 
chain. On the customer side, this includes the exit from new coal-fired power plants and targets 
to replace sulfur hexafluoride with climate-friendly alternatives in its transmission products. We 
think the share of renewables will experience significant growth. However, strong demand 
tailwinds in renewable operations and new product offerings for hydrogen technology are offset 
by the group's conventional power generation and oil and gas activities. The group's sustainable 
strategy is supported by short- and long-term equity-based compensations granted to selected 
senior executives and the executive board if they achieve nonfinancial targets that reflect 
Siemens Energy's ESG strategy. The targets set out by the chief executive officer, who also 
holds the role of chief sustainability officer, support the group's sustainability strategy. The 
group has underperformed on its business plan for SGRE but the performance of its gas and 
power division remains in line with our base-case expectation. SGRE's potential execution risks 
could impair governance on a group basis.
www.spglobal.com/ratingsdirect January 29, 2025       14Siemens Energy
Group Influence
Siemens Energy fully owns SGRE. We consider SGRE as core to Siemens Energy because we 
think it is integral to the group's current identity and future strategy.
Issue Ratings--Subordination Risk Analysis
Capital structure
The group's outstanding debt consists largely of senior unsecured obligations.
Analytical conclusions
We rate Siemens Energy' senior unsecured debt 'BBB-', in line with the issuer credit rating, 
because no significant elements of subordination risk are present in the capital structure and 
adjusted debt to EBITDA is well below 2x.

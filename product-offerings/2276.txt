Gas Field Policy 2:  Compressor Performance Policy 
 
It is the responsibility of the Reseller to quote and sell Siemens Energy compressors only for conditions of 
service that are within the limits of the compressor. It is also the responsibility of the Reseller to design and 
manufacture their package so that the Siemens Energy  compressor is protected from having any of its 
limitations exceeded, at any time, while operating at any normal or upset condition (including relief valve 
discharge pressure). 
 
Orders can be accepted only if no compressor limitati on outlined below is exceeded at any time except for those 
specifically approved by Siemens Energy HSRC Group. 
 
 
COMPRESSOR PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS 
 
Siemens Energy HSRC Group will review the guarantee poi nt performance and any off-design performance, of 
new Siemens Energy compressors, calculated using the latest version of t he Siemens Energy HSRC 
sizing/performance program, during t he quote stage or at the time of the order, at no additional charge.  
Siemens Energy HSRC Group will advise the Reseller of any limitations exceeded, special construction 
required, or any other problems or concerns. As a part of this review, Siemens Energy HSRC Group will check the internal gas and combined rod loads at the suction and discharge pressures that result in the highest rod 
loads, adding the margins listed below to the discharge pressure to allow for a reasonable margin between the 
compressor load limits and protective devices.  These l oads will be checked and confirmed for all speeds within 
the range of the driver. 
 
Stage Discharge 
Pressure (PSIG ) Margin Above 
Dischar ge Pressure Stage Discharge 
Pressure (PSIG ) Margin Above 
Dischar ge Pressure 
-14.7 to 150 15 PSI 2501 to 3500 8% 
151 to 2500 10% 3501 to 6000 6% 
 
Based on the various criteria contained herein, Siemens Energy HSRC Group must be satisfied that the internal 
gas load does not exceed the Maximum Allowable Cont inuous Gas Load (MACGL) and the combined rod load 
does not exceed the Maximum Allowable Continuou s Combined Rod Load (MACCRL) at any time. 
 Additional criteria and limitations to be considered wh en reviewing compressor performance are as follows: 
 
•  Maximum Allowable Working Pressure (MAWP) s hall not exceed that as defined by the cylinder 
rating. 
 
•  Horsepower/Throw shall not exceed that defined by the frame (except as specifically approved 
by DR HSRC Marketing) 
. 
• Discharge Volumetric Efficiencies shall not fall below 10%. 
 
•  Adiabatic Discharge Temperature (for pressures less than 4000 PSIG) shall not exceed 300°F 
(149°C). For pressures greater than 4000 PSIG, see additional information herein. 
 
• Predicted Actual Discharge Temperatur es shall not exceed 350°F (177°C). 
 
•  Alarm on Discharge Temperature should be set at 25°F higher than predicted actual discharge 
temperature. 
 
•  Rod Reversal shall exceed 40°. 
  
• The ratio of tension load to compression load or vice-versa, shall exceed 20%.

• The recommended maximum allowable RPM of compressors operating at high discharge 
pressure and / or heavy mole weight gases can be found on the following curves. See Figures 1 
& 2. 
 
1. Use the discharge pressure (psig) to  determine the maximum allowable adiabatic 
discharge temperature. 
 
2. Divide the Molecular Weight (MW) by the lowest encountered compressibility (Z) to 
determine MW / Z. 
 3. Find the "Maximum Speed Factor" limitati on from Figure 1 based on both the Pressure 
(top curve) and MW / Z (bottom curve), and use whichever is lower. 
 
4. Find the Maximum Allowable Speed for a frame from Figure 2 using the "Maximum 
Speed Factor". 
 
Example 1 -  For a discharge pressure of 4000 ps ig and MW/Z of 20, the Maximum Speed Factor is 
12 and the maximum allowable adiabatic disc harge temperature is 300 degree F. For a 
6" stroke frame the Maximum Allowable Speed is 1200 RPM. 
 
Example 2 -  For a discharge pressure of 2000 ps ig and a MW/Z of 50, the Maximum Speed Factor 
is 9 and the maximum allowable adiabatic discharge temperature is 300 degree F. For 
a 4" stroke frame the Maximum Allowable Speed is 1350 RPM.  
 
Example 3 -  For a discharge pressure of 6000 ps ig and a MW/Z of 20, the Maximum Speed Factor 
is 9 and the maximum allowable adiabatic discharge temperature is 270 degree F. For a 3.5" stroke frame the Maxi mum Allowable Speed is 1543 RPM. 
 
Any application outside these recommended limits should be approved by Siemens Energy HSRC Group prior 
to quoting. 
 
 
SPECIAL APPLICATION REVIEW 
 
Siemens HSRC Group should also review and approve any applications with any of the following parameters 
before Resellers quote them:  
• Discharge pressures 6000 PSIG or greater. 
 
• Differential pressures greater than 3000 PSIG for a given stage. 
 
• Predicted actual discharge temperatures of 325° F or greater. 
 
• All Non-Lubricated applications. 
 
• Heavy gas applications (ie MW >40). 
 
• Applications involving process gases i.e., hy drogen, oxygen, chlorine, carbon monoxide, etc.

CAPACITY CONTROL OPTIONS 
 
Acceptable methods of capacity control are listed below: 
A.  SPEED CONTROL - The preferred method of redu cing compressor  capacity is speed reduction, 
where variable speed drivers are employed. 
 
B. FLOW REDUCTION BY ADDING CLEARANCE - Clearance may be added to the head end of 
cylinders with manual variable-volume clearanc e pockets, or to the head end with pneumatic 
fixed-volume clearance pockets, clearance bottl es, and/or split-valve-yokes. Any time clearance 
is added, care must be taken to insure that t he discharge volumetric efficiency for any cylinder 
end is ten percent (10%) or more, for proper valve operation and so that temperature 
pyramiding does not occur. With special "Pi peline" or "Storage" cylinders, pneumatic fixed 
volume clearance pockets may be also added to crank end. 
 
C.  TOTAL UNLOADING OF CYLINDER ENDS - T he preferred method is suction valve removal. 
Normally the head end is unloaded first to avoid cross-head non-reversal problems. The 
minimum number of degrees of rod reversal (40 degrees) and ratio of minimum combined load 
to maximum combined load (>20 percent) must be met. This must be checked throughout the operating RPM range. 
 
D.  TOTAL CYLINDER END UNLOADING BY PNEUMA TIC UNLOADERS - When it is not possible 
to shut down, vent and purge the compressor and  system to remove the suction valve(s), 
pneumatically-operated "plug" or "port" unloader s may be furnished. (Finger type unloaders are 
no longer recommended.) As above, the head-end of  the cylinder must be unloaded before the 
crank-end, unless otherwise approved by Siemens Energy HSRC Group, after a review of the 
entire operating range of the compressor. When  end unloading is required, please consult 
Siemens Energy HSRC Group for guidance and approval. Normally cylinders should not be 
completely unloaded with pneumatic unloaders except for very brief periods at startup. 
Pneumatic unloaders reduce valve lift areas and de crease cylinder efficiency. They should be 
used only when absolutely required. 
 
E.  SIEMENS ENERGY RECOMMENDS THAT A PULSATION STUDY OF THE PIPING SYSTEM 
BE PERFORMED WHENEVER IT IS ANTICI PATED THAT THE COMPRESSOR WILL BE 
OPERATED WITH ANY CYLINDER END(S)  TOTALLY UNLOADED BY ANY METHOD. 
 
F.  BYPASS - A bypass from final discharge to init ial suction, through a throttling valve, may be 
used either as a sole means of capacity control or, more commonly, in conjunction with other 
methods. Since the cooling effect of ex pansion across a throttling valve is normally not enough 
to remove the heat of compression, capacity c ontrol using a throttling bypass usually requires 
taking gas downstream of the aftercooler, or providing cooling for the bypass, to prevent heat 
buildup through the system. The opposite case of  too much cooling across the valve can also 
be a problem because of a potential for freezing of  the throttling valve due to localized cooling 
due to expansion. Maximum differential across the valve will depend on operating temperature, 
ambient temperature, and gas composition. St eps to prevent freeze-up include multi-step 
throttling and heat tracing of the valve. Please note:  Any cooled bypass, whether for throttling 
or for start-up, should be returned to the inlet si de of the unit upstream of the separator element 
due to the potential of entrained moisture being carried into the inlet gas stream.

PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE POLICY 
 
Siemens Energy will guarantee the design point performance of its new (unused) compressors, when the 
performance has been reviewed and approved by Siemens Energy HSRC Group in accordance with procedures 
outlined above. This review affords Siemens Energy the opportunity to detect possible input errors, and / or the 
exceeding of compressor design limitations which may have been overlooked during the proposal stage. 
 
Siemens Energy guarantees the compressor flow an d horsepower, independently, within a tolerance of 3%, 
subject to the following conditions: 
 
1.  All cylinders must be double-acting. (Singl e-acting cylinders may be used for off-design 
conditions, as outlined above). 
 
2. The compressed gases must be delivered to the suction flange of each cylinder with 99.9%, by 
weight, of all entrained solid and liquid part icles, ten microns and larger, removed. 
 
3.  Performance falls within RPM guidelines spec ified in above. If it falls outside the guidelines, 
guarantee tolerance becomes 6%. 
 
4.  Suction pressure of all stages and/or services  is higher than 10 PSIG. If pressure is less than 10 
PSIG, guarantee tolerance becomes 6%. 
 
Any field performance test must be in accordance with the following: 
 
1.  The test must be performed in accordance with ISO 1217.  
2.  The test must be performed within 60 days of initial start-up. 
 
3. The compressor owner shall ensure that all equipmen t is in "as-new" condition at the time of the 
test. 
 4.  The extrapolation from guarantee point to actual test point, if necessary, will be done by 
Siemens Energy, utilizing Siemens Energy form ulas and computer performance prediction 
programs. Suction and discharge pressures ar e measured at the respective compressor 
cylinder suction and discharge flanges. 
 
5.  A pulsation study of the process pi ping system must have been performed. 
 
6. The compressor driver must have been performan ce tested at the driver manufacturer's factory. 
 
7. The charges for Siemens Energy servicemen, te chnicians and /or engineers, to verify the field 
testing procedures and / or results, if required,  will be in accordance with the applicable service 
rates and conditions in effect at the time of the verification.

PERFORMANCE CURVE POLICY 
 
1.  Basic Performance Curves can be generated fr om the latest version of the Siemens Energy 
HSRC Sizing/Performance Program. 
 
2. Special Performance Curves required to  be generated by Siemens Energy HSRC Group will be 
priced upon request with full definition of the number and scope required. Pricing will depend 
upon the estimated engineering hours required to generate the Performance Curves. This 
applies to both new and used compressors. 
 
3.  As noted above, Siemens Energy's policy is  to guarantee only one Design Point performance 
on new compressors. Performance is not guar anteed on used compressors. All performance 
will be generated with the latest version of t he Siemens Energy HSRC Sizing/Performance 
Program using the most accurate cylinder data available.

Gas Field Policy 11:  Low Molecular Weight Application 
 
The following guidelines must be met before a Siemens Energy Compressor can be offered for Lubricated 
Hydrogen or other Low Molecular Weight Applications: 
 
1.  All sizing and performance must be reviewed and approved by Siemens Energy HSRC Group prior to 
quoting. 
 
2.  Maximum discharge pressure limitation is normally  2000 PSIG. Refer any higher pressure applications 
to Siemens Energy HSRC Group for review. 
 3.  Water-cooled cylinders are required where there is end unloading and/or predicted discharge 
temperatures above 225°F. 
 4.  MOS cylinders require a distance piece. HOS and HOSS will require an extra long distance piece. All 
distance pieces must be sealed and purged. 
 5.  All applications must be review ed at stage relief valve setting conditions to ensure they are within 
allowable rod loads. 
 6. Piston rod packing material and piston ring material must be Durawear DW173 material or equivalent. 
 
7.  Compressor cylinder oil may be crankcase oil if it is clean and dry. Otherwise, a separate oil system and 
day tank are required - see co mpressor instruction book. 
 
8.  Compressor valves need to be reviewed by Siemens Energy HSRC and the lift and flow area will likely 
be reduced to promote reliable operation. 
 
9.  No manual unloading systems such as VVCP' s. Acceptable unloading sy stems are FVCP's and 
pneumatically operated valve unloaders. 
 10.  The maximum period that the compressor can be run without a load is 3-5 minutes. 
 
11.  Helium test on compress or cylinders is required. 
 
12.  Actual predicted discharge temperatures should be 275°F or less at normal operating performance 
point. 
 
13.  Special attention should be paid to sealing the process gas system. No fiber gaskets are allowed. 
 14.  HOS and HOSS 26.00-28.00" "clamshell type" cylinder cannot be used.

Gas Field Policy 12:  Acid Gas Application 
 
Acid Gas Compressor Applications typically involve the compression of flare gas from oil field amine 
regeneration systems, but these Guidelines can be app lied to any similar gas stream. Normally "Acid Gas" 
contains 50 - 100% H2S and CO2 with minor amounts of other common gas field gases and is saturated with 
water vapor. It is important to have an accurate gas analysis and definition of the full range of operation 
pressures and temperatures. Also see: GFP-16 Car bon Dioxide Service (With H20) and GFP-18 Sour Gas 
Service. 
 
The following guidelines must be met before a Siemens Energy Compressor can be offered for an Acid Gas 
Application.  
1.  All sizing and performance must be reviewed and approved by Siemens Energy HSRC Group prior to 
quoting.  
 
2.  Due to the high specific gravity of Acid Gas,  rotative speeds 90% or less than design RPM are 
preferred. 
 
3.  Gas cooled cylinders are preferred but water-co oled designs are acceptable. If a circulating water 
system is utilized, care must be taken to k eep temperature at least 10 deg. F above inlet gas 
temperatures. 
 
4.  Siemens Energy standard cast iron and nodular  iron cylinder materials (ASTM A278 Class 40 (Gray 
Iron) and ASTM A536 (Ductile Iron) Grade 65-45-12 or ASTM A395 (Ductile Iron) Grade 60-40-18 are 
acceptable up to rated pressures.  Forged steel cylinders must use "s our gas" billets. Non-lubricated 
applications are limited to < 1000 PSIG max. 
 
5.  All pressure packing and wiper packing cases should be of purged design.  
 
6.  Packing rings should be DW173 with CI pr essure breaker and backup rings as necessary. Non-
lubricated cylinders should use PEEK pa cking rings. All piston rings and/or rider rings  should be DW173 
material. 
 
7.  HOS and HOSS compressors may require an extra long distance piece. MOS cylinders require an 
added distance piece. All distance pieces must be  sealed and either purged or vented to a safe area. 
Slingers may be provided which will require extra-long distance pieces. 
 8.  Please refer to GFP-16 for special consi deration with regard to cylinder lubrication.  
 
9.  Compressor valve springs should be Elgiloy. Wh ere steel valve seats and guards are standard, they 
should be changed to stainless steel. A "Dynamic Valve Analysis" is recommended to ensure proper 
valve action on each application. Valve lifts reduced from standard may be required. Valve seat gaskets 
should be soft iron or aluminum. 
 
10. Piston rods should be age hardened 17-4 PH stai nless steel with full length TC3 coating through the 
packing and scraper rings.

Gas Field Policy 15:  Air or Nitrogen Service 
 
The following criteria must be met before a Siemens Energy compressor can be offered for air or nitrogen 
service: 
 
 
1. All air applications must be lubric ated with synthetic oil.  This may require distance pieces or extra-
long distance pieces to allow for an oil slinger sinc e synthetic oil is not compatible with mineral oil

Gas Field Policy 16:  Carbon Dioxide Service (with H2O) 
 
GENERAL: 
 
Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas which is normally obtained by combustion of carbon (in any form) with an excess of oxygen. It is also obtained from the heating of limestone or from the action of acids on 
carbonate materials, or as a by-produ ct of fermentation. Carbon dioxide is soluble in water, alcohol and alkalies. 
Its water solution is carbonic acid which is very corrosive.  
Although carbon dioxide is not poisonous, it  induces asphyxia by excluding oxygen. CO
2 does not react with air 
or oxygen and is therefore neither explosive nor combustible.   
 
MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION:  
CO
2 is substantially non-corrosive. Synthetic rubbers have commercial resistance to this gas. 
 
In the presence of water, however, CO 2 will cause severe corrosion of unp rotected iron and steel, which could 
be significant during idle periods with low cylinder wall temperatures.  
Please refer to Section 15.4 (Carbon Dioxide) of API 11P Second edition, dated November 1, 1989. 
 
1.  If the concentration of CO
2 (in a wet gas phase), at the suction pr essure of any stage, falls into the 
"A" range (see curve page 2), Siemens Energy re commends its standard materials of construction. 
 
2.  If the concentration of CO 2 (in a wet gas phase), at the suction pr essure of any stage, falls into the 
"B" range (see curve page 2), Siemens Energy requ ires the following construction for maximum 
resistance to corrosion.   
1.  Age Hardened 17-4 PH stainl ess steel piston rods with Siemens Energy "TC3" coating in the 
area of packing travel. 
 
2. Stainless steel internal bolting in "clamshell" type cylinders. 
 3. Suction port oilers located in cylinder or suction piping. 
 
4. Stainless steel or pickled and oiled frame lube oil piping. 
 
5. Frequent bore inspections to determine proper  cylinder lubrication rate (See “Commissioning”  
 Section below). 
 
6. Valve cover "O" rings can be 90 durometer Viton or AFLAS.  
7. Valve cover o-rings may also be made from Virgin Teflon® material. This has proven successful 
 in reducing/eliminating explosive decompression (ED) in standard o-rings.  
8. Oil slingers are required due to oil compatibility and longer distance pieces may be required. 
 Note: Please refer Siemens Energy HSRC Grou p for any other special requirements. 
 
3. In all cases, the distributor and operator must insure that liquids are not allowed to form or 
accumulate in any compressor cylinder. 
 
 
Siemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG.   Gas Field Policy, GFP 16 
Februar y, 2021 
CYLINDER LUBRICATION: 
 
1. CO 2  is soluble in mineral oils, thereby reducing the oil / gas mixture viscosity.  Mineral oils are 
complete miscible into CO 2 which can have a major effect on an oil’s ability to lubricate.  PAG (poly-
alkaline-glycol) synthetic lubricants are commonl y used where there is a specified level of CO 2 
concentration associated with a given operational CO 2 gas pressure (see following graph). 
 
2. If the concentration of CO 2  and suction pressures are greater than prescribed values in the 
following graph, a pure synthetic PAG (poly-alkaline- glycol) with a viscosity index of 150 or greater 
is recommended. 
 3. Again, in all cases, the distri butor and operator must insure that liquids are not allowed to form or 
accumulate in any compressor cylinder. 
 
4. Cylinder pre-lube can be employed if you have an off-mounted lubrication system.  As CO
2 has an 
affinity to sweep away oil, a pre-lube will ensur e that there will not be a dry start on the cylinder 
bore.  A suggested time for pre-lube would be 10-15 minutes.  Adjust pre-lube time as dictated by 
cylinder bore inspections. 
 
 
COMMISSIONING: 
 
1. Verifying proper lubrication rates is critical to  the successful operational life of compressor cylinders 
and pressure packing, especially within  the first days and weeks of operation. 
 
2. After establishing and making preparations for t he correct oil to lubricate the cylinder bore and 
pressure packing, a stepped procedure for periodic cylinder bore inspections is to be carried out. 
 
3. During “break-in”, initial cylinder bore lube oil rates should be established as per the unit Operation 
and Maintenance Manual.  Note that the compressor s leave the factory with their lube pumps set at 
the maximum flow rate which typically exceeds the recommended break-in rate by 10-20%. 
 
4. Cylinder bores should be inspected for proper lu brication after the first three days of operation and 
once a week thereafter for the next three weeks of  operation.  All inspections should use the 
“Cigarette Paper” test (see manual for details). 
 
5. After the first three weeks of operation, if t he cylinders are showing adequate lubrication using the 
“Cigarette Paper” test, the lubrication rates may be adjusted down assuming more than adequate 
lubrication is present during the inspections above. 
 
6. Lubrication rates should be adjusted down in increments of 5-10% maximum. 
 
7. Once the lubrication rate is turned down, all cylinder bores should be inspected weekly using the 
“Cigarette Paper” test.  Assuming this inspec tion passes the “Cigarette Paper” test, it is 
recommended the unit be ran for three weeks before turning down the lubrication rates again. 
 
8. There should always be enough oil present to we t the “Cigarette Paper”.  If the paper doesn’t wet, 
then the lubricator rates should be increased. 
 
NOTE  
 
The “Cigarette Paper” test only gives indication of oil 
film quantity.  It does not give an indication of viscosity 
quality.  Oils diluted with water, hydrocarbons or other constituents 
may produce what appears to be an adequate film but the oil may 
not have the required load-carrying capability due to dilution.

GENERAL: 
 
High Speed Reciprocating Compressors wi th standard construction may be applied to temperatures -20°F and 
above.   
Applications below -20°F must be reviewed by Siem ens Energy Marketing Group pr ior to quoting. (In most

Gas Field Policy 18:  Sour Gas Service 
 
GENERAL: 
 
Hydrogen Sulfide H 2S is a colorless gas which is harmful at concent rations of 20 ppm in air. At concentrations of 
800 ppm death results within 30 minutes due to destruction of lung tissues. At low concentrations (1 to 20 ppm), 
it has a strong rotten egg odor and is harmless. However,  at higher concentrations, the sense of smell is 
anesthetized and the gas is odorless. It is heavier than air (mole. wt. 34) and so tends to accumulate in low 
places. Due to the hazardous nature of this gas, compressors handling H 2S should not be approached unless 
H2S leak detection equipment is functioning. 
 Effects on metals: H
2S tends to cause sulfide stress cracking in st eels when all of the following four conditions 
exists: 
 A.  The H
2S concentration and pressure condition fall into the "sulfide stress cracking region: of NACE MR-
0175 (figure 1). 
 B. The steel component has a hardness over 22 Rockwell "C". 
 
C. The steel component is stressed.  
D. Moisture is present in the gas. 
 Sulfide stress cracking is more aggressive if chlorides are also present in the gas. 
 
To prevent sulfide stress cracking of components that lie within the NACE definit ion of sour gas service, 
materials of less than 22 HRC must be used. Alternatively,  materials with a greater resistance to attack may be 
used (e.g. Age Hardened 17-4 PH stainless steel piston rods). 
 
 
MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION:  
A. If the concentration of H
2S, at the discharge pressure of any stag e, falls into the "B" range (figure 1), 
Siemens Energy recommends its standard materials of construction. 
 
B. If the concentration of H 2S, at the discharge pressure of any stag e, falls into the "A" range (figure 1), 
Siemens Energy requires the following construction for maximum resistance to sulfide stress cracking and containment of the gas. 
 
1) Distance pieces: Distance pieces must be arranged so that potentially harmful leakage of H
2S to 
the atmosphere cannot occur. Possible alternatives are: 
 
A) For all applications Siemens Energy recommends the use of a single compartment 
distance piece equipped with purged packing case, purged  wiper case and slinger if 
desired (figure 2). The distance piece and pa cking vents should be piped to a flare or 
recovery system. In some cases an extra long distance piece may be required. 
 
B) Standard single-compartment distance pieces may be used with caution if a sweet gas 
packing purge and vacuum scavenge pump is us ed to maintain the distance piece at 
negative pressure and gas leakage is eliminated. Piston rod oil slingers are 
recommended to minimize frame oil contamination. 
 
C) Two compartment distance pieces are ava ilable if preferred. Please consult with the 
Siemens Energy HSRC Group for further details.

Februar y, 2021 
 
2) Bolting: 
 
A) Bolting that is in the cylinder end distance  piece is outside the NACE definition of sour 
gas service (less than 65 PSIG). Theref ore, Siemens Energy will use standard 
materials for the distance piece studs, nuts and bolts. 
 
B) Bolting that is external of the cylinde r uses standard materials; e.g. outer head-to-
cylinder studs which are located outside the head gasket; pulsation bottle-to-cylinder bolting; etc. 
 
C) ASTM A193, Grade B7M is used on certai n cylinder designs where the head bolting is 
in the process gas passageway; e.g., Clamshell head designs. 
 
3) Standard piston with rider bands or combination rings 
 
4)  Piston rods shall be ann ealed 4142 carbon steel (18-22 HRC) with Siemens Energy TC3 
coating in the area of packing travel. (If the gas also contains CO
2, please refer to "GFP-16". If 
stainless steel rods are required, they will be made out of age hardened 17-4 PH material and 
TC3 coated.) 
 
5) Suction port oilers are recommended. Alternat ively, the valves can be supplied with special 
spring material. 
 
6) Siemens Energy standard nodular iron valves will be furnished when pressures allow. 
 
7) If forged steel cylinders are required for the application, a modified AISI 4132 steel alloy is 
required. 
  
EXCEPTIONS TO NACE MR01 75-94 SPECIFICATION: 
 
1) A combination of Siemens Energy field experience  and reference to specifications NACE MR0-175-94 
and API 11P has been used to compile this GFP. Siem ens Energy has taken into account stress levels, 
type of stress, exposure to sour gas and the critical nature of the part. 
 
2) Hardness of Carbon and Low-Allo y Steels (3.2), and ferritic stainl ess steels (3.6) materials shall not 
exceed 22 HRC. 
 
A) Tube Fittings. Tube fittings will be type 316 stai nless steel double ferrule type. The hardness of 
the ferrule will exceed 22 HRC. Field experience with these fittings has been excellent. 
 
B) Chrome Silicon Springs are not listed by NACE as an acceptabl e material. Siemens Energy has 
had favorable experience with this material in compressor valve service. 
 
C) AISI 440C Stainless Steel hardened and tempered  to 50 HRC. This material is used as a guide 
ring on PF valves. The stress level is minimal. Siemens Energy has had favorable experience. 
 
D) Steel Nut, PF Valve. The stress level is lo w and Siemens Energy has favorable experience. 
 
E) Rollpin. This is used as a valve plate guide on the PF valve. The stress level is low. Siemens 
Energy has favorable experience in lubricated valve service. 
 
F) Piston rods made from AISI 4142 alloy steel are tempered back to 22 HRC or less. After the 
tempering heat treatment, threads are rolled on the rods, causing hardness at the roots of the 
threads to exceed 22 HRC. However, field experience in sour gas has been very good due to 
favorable residual stress pattern, surface finish, and grain flow patterns. 
 
Siemens Energy is a trademark licensed by Siemens AG   Gas Field Policy, GFP 18 
Februar y, 2021 
 
3)  Siemens Energy has favorable experience with the following cast irons: 
 A) ASTM A278 Class 40 (Gray Iron), ASTM A536 (Ductile Iron) (Grade 65-45-12) and ASTM A395 
(Ductile Iron) (Grade 60-40-18) for compressor cylinders and other components. 
 
B) Continuous Cast Gray Iron is used on solid pi stons and some small cylinder heads. It is 
equivalent to a Class 30/35 iron. 
 
C) Centrifugally Cast Gray Iron is used for cyli nder liners. It is equivalent to a Class 35 iron. 
 
D) NiResist ASTM A436 Type 5 with 34-36% Ni (Minovar) is used as a piston rod collar on 
aluminum pistons due to its low coefficient of  thermal expansion. The material is under 
compression at all times. 
 
E) Ductile Iron, Continuous Cast Grade 80-55- 06 is used for fully machined low to medium 
pressure valve seats and stopplates & guards. 
 
F) Ductile Iron Castings Grade 100-70-30 is used fo r low to medium pressure PF valve seats and 
stopplates & guards. 
 
4)  COMMENTS TO NACE MR0175 SPECIFICATION: 
 A) Paragraph 6.2.2.1, ASTM A193, Grade B7 M bolting 80,000 psi minimum yield strength and 
HRC 22 maximum hardness. This material is us ed on certain cylinder designs where the head 
bolting is in the process gas passageway; e.g., Clamshell head designs. It is also used as an 
option for cylinder bolting at an extra cost. This bolting meets the requirements of this 
Paragraph, however, it may exceed the 90,000 psi maximum yield strength limitation as outlined 
by API 11P, Paragraph 15.3.2.2. AISI 4142 alloy steel piston rods may al so exceed the 90,000 
psi yield strength limitation up to a maximum of 95,000 psi. 
 
B) Paragraph 10.7.2, Aluminum Alloy 335, Temper T-7 (ASTM B-26). Siemens Energy uses either 
Alloy 355-T7, Alloy SR 319.0-T51, or Frontier 40H for aluminum pistons.

PURGED PACKING / PURGED WIPER ARRANGEMENT 
FOR SOUR GAS APPLICATIONS 
 
1. PURGED ROD PACKING - In our "standard" rod pack ing, the vent line is just  ahead of the last packing 
cup (closest to the frame). For sour gas service, t he packing rings of the last  two cups are exchanged 
for "side loaded" rings, with a PURGE line in between. This is so that any PURGE gas leakage will be in 
both directions (into the VENT line and into the di stance piece), and any no rmal PROCESS gas leakage 
will be carried away by the VENT line. 
 
2.  PURGED WIPER CASE - For an extra measure of safety, two sets of "side loaded" rings, with a 
PURGE line in between, are added to the wiper case (at the frame end of the distance piece). Any 
leakage of PURGE gas will be in both directions (into the distance piece and into the frame extension). 
 3.  DISTANCE PIECE - Any leakage into the distan ce piece, of either PURGE or PROCESS gas, will be 
carried away by the distance piece VENT line. An "oil  slinger" (if required per the order) can be attached 
to the piston rod to keep any oil which has had contact with the PROCESS gas (from the rod packing) 
from traveling along the piston rod and into the fram e. This may require an extra long distance piece. 
 
This distance piece configuratio n creates a double buffer between t he PROCESS gas and the frame. This 
arrangement produces the same effect as the API 11P Type 3 distance piece option. 
Both PURGE gas lines should be protected from back pres sure by a check valve outside the distance piece, 
supplied by the Reseller.

Gas Field Policy 21:  Torsional Vibration Analysis 
 
TORSIONAL VIBRATION ANALYSIS OF SIEMENS ENERGY HSRC 
COMPRESSORS AND DRIVING MACHINERY  
 
Siemens Energy, upon request, will act as a consultant and perform a torsional vibration analysis of the 
separable drive system. Please refer to the appropri ate price page for the cost of this service. 
 
Siemens Energy’s responsibility is limited to providing a proper engineering torsional analysis. The responsibility 
for engineering of the system components (other than t he compressor), and the supply of these components 
must remain with others. 
 
The analysis will either confirm satisfactory torsional operat ion of the system as submi tted, or it will recommend 
the changes that need to be made to the shafting system fo r satisfactory operation over the conditions specified 
by the customer. 
 The torsional vibration analysis is not intended to chec k or give approval to the transmission shafting in such 
areas as sensitivity to misalignment or any other engi neering aspect connected with the selection, mounting, 
and operation of a separable compressor and its drivi ng machinery. The responsibility for satisfactory 
engineering in these areas is outside Si emens Energy’s scope of responsibility. 
 
The following guidelines are to better define when a torsional analysis is required:  
I. Torsional Analysis  Study Requirement 
 
A. A torsional study is required when a separabl e compressor is driven; by a turbine or 
engine through a gear; or by any motor. 
 
B. A Siemens Energy HSRC compressor directly coupled to an engine driver does not 
require a torsional analysis if the coupling is selected based on the maximum BHP capability of the compressor or engine frame, whichever is less (rather than the 
maximum BHP of the specific compressor app lication). In this case the mass elastic 
properties of the system will be suffi cient to provide torsional stability. 
 
C. If the coupling is selected for less than the maximum BHP capability of both the 
compressor and engine frame and the compressor is directly coupled to an engine, then a torsional study will be required if the operating conditions of the unit fit into one 
or more of the following criteria: 
 
1. Discharge pressure is higher than 1400 psig 
2. Compression ratio is less than 1.8 
3. Single acting cylinder is used for any condition 4. Two-in-one cylinder configuration is used 
5. The ratio of tension and compression frame loads is more than 2.5 or less than 0.4 
6. Large rod load and small BHP applications, where RLR (Rod Load Ratio) - HPR  
 (Horsepower Ratio) is greater than or equal to 35.

If no torsional analysis is required, the coupling select ion can be based on the maximum BHP of the specific 
compression application. In this case, WR 2 is provided by the engine manufacturer's standard flywheel. 
 
If a torsional analysis is required, the coupling selection and required flywheel WR 2, if any, will be determined 
by Siemens Energy at the time of the analysis.  
The coupling used in any engine-compressor drive system must be torsionally stiff but be able to 
accommodate some axial misalignment. A suitable coupling is Thomas or equivalent.  
II. Data Required By Siemens Energy For The Torsional Analysis 
 
A. The complete operating performance envelope of the compressor including speed ranges and 
unloaded conditions. 
 
B. The complete description of the drive train,  including name of manufacturer(s), model numbers 
and diameters for the gear reducer and engine sha fts, plus the tentative coupling selections. 
 
C. The WR
2 of the motor rotor, and shaft drawings of the driver and gear reducer rotating parts. 
The driver shaft drawing must include the keyway dimensions, including radius, and shaft 
material including ultimate tensile strength. 
 
D. The method of unloading the compressor for st art-up. (If bypass, pipe sizes are required.) 
 
E. All information of the driver and shaft syst em must be supplied by the customer to Siemens 
Energy. A completed "Torsional Analysis Informat ion" form (see GFP-1) must be a part of the 
order. 
 
III. SCOPE OF TORSIONAL ANALYSIS  
A. The scope of Siemens Energy’s analysis  is to select the proper flywheel WR
2 (if required) and 
coupling stiffness, to ensure safe unit operation. Turbine or engine driven unit operation will be 
investigated, over the customer's specified sp eed range, for the presence of any critical speed 
at which the unit operation would be unsafe. 
 
B. The torsional analysis studies the effects of th e compressor torque on the mass-elastic system 
of the entire drive system. It is not intended to stud y vibrations (lateral or torsional), within the 
gears or between the gear reducer and turbine, generated by gear irregul arities, since these 
types of vibration must be investigated by the gear manufacturer, during the design stage. 
 
C. Shutdown of the unit under no-load and vented conditions is permissible in any system, and is 
therefore not a part of this study. 
 
D. For direct drive motor units, the vibratory stress in the moto r shaft will be evaluated to check 
that it is in a safe range according to Siemens Energy standards. 
 IV. MOTOR DRIVER RECOMMENDATIONS: 
 
A. Motor shaft diameter should be as large as possible with the minimum acceptable diameter 
(anywhere on the shaft) determined by the following formula: 
 
B. The ultimate tensile strength of the motor shaft material should be 75,000 PSI minimum.

Februar y, 2021 
C. If the above motor shaft recommendations are not followed, and the analysis determines that 
the submitted shaft is not suitable, additional charges for further study will be applicable. 
 
D. The motor manufacturer must be advised that  the motor will be driving a reciprocating 
compressor which is a severe duty and must be designed suitable for the following vibratory 
torques: 
 
2 throw compressor   +/- 200% Motor nameplate torque 
4 throw compressor   +/- 175% Motor nameplate torque 
6 throw compressor   +/- 150% Motor nameplate torque 
 
This means that for a motor driving a 2 thro w compressor the motor must be suitable for a 
torque variation within each revolution of a mean torque equal to nameplate torque,maximum 
torque equal to positive 300% of nameplate torque and minimum torque equal to negative 100% nameplate torque. 
 
E.  The motor shaft should be designed without a keyw ay. If the shaft is designed with a keyway full 
details of the design must be included with the shaft information supplied to Siemens Energy. 
 
F. The prime mover HP must include allowance fo r the tolerance on compressor BHP (See GFP2). 
Failure to adhere to this practice may prohibit unit operation at full load. It is further 
recommended that prime movers be selected in accordance with ISO-13631: 2002 Section 8. 
 
G. Adherence to these guidelines may reduce the need for a flywheel under certain conditions of 
service, or possible rejection of the motor. 
 
H. For reference, motor suppliers should use the following inertia values when determining 
breakaway torque requirements. This data r epresents the highest inertia that could be 
encountered for the given frame.

Gas Field Policy 22:  API 618 Comments & E xceptions, 5th Edition (December, 2007)  
 
Siemens Energy builds compressors in basic compliance with this edition of API-618.  Our experience 
has shown that a few of the requirements do not a dd commensurate life or reliability and therefore the 
following clarifications are indicated.  
SIEMENS ENERGY HOS AND HOSS COMPRESSORS 
 Paragraph                                                                    Comment  
 
6.1.1 The compressors offered are designed and cons tructed for a minimum service life of 20 years.  
They are suitable for continuous full load duty for at least 3 years between major overhauls, and 
should only require replacement of recognized wear  components (rings, valves , packing, oil filters, 
etc.) during this period.  Siemens Energy strongly recommends that normal published maintenance schedules be followed. 
 
6.1.3 Unless specifically stated otherwise, capacity may vary by +/- 3%.  
6.1.6 If required, Siemens Energy can furnish typical or expected noise level data for this equipment.  
These noise levels may not comply with the requirements of API 615. 
 
6.1.18 Unless specifically stated otherwise, horsepower may vary by +/- 3%. 
 6.1.26 Spare/replacement pa rts...to meet (Par. 9.3.6) except Siem ens Energy will not provide specific 
materials of construction (identified by  applicable international standards). 
 6.2.1 Threads on the HOS/HOSS VVCP piston rod ar e 2.5"-3 ACME-3G and do not conform to the 8 
pitch requirement 1.00" and over diameter. 
 6.2.3 Internal socket fasteners can be found on the mu lti-screw tensioners used on piston retainment for 
the HOS and HOSS compressors.  Slotted nut desi gns have successfully been used for piston 
retainment on the HOS of decades.  
 
6.2.5 The piston rod for all Siemens Energy HSRC Pr oducts is not positively locked to the crosshead 
assembly.  HOS conn rod bolts no longer have a "positive" locking mechanism and now rely only on stretch. 
 
6.3.1 On larger bore cylinders, piston rod vertical  run out may exceed the . 00015 in./in. of stroke 
limitation. 
 
6.5.1 The maximum predicted temperature shall not  exceed 300°F (adiabatic) and 350°F (actual).  In 
hydrogen rich service, the maximum predicted te mperature shall not exceed 275°F (adiabatic) and 
300°F (actual). 
 6.8.1.3 Some of the larger cylinder patterns, when placed  side by side, do not allow access to water jacket 
covers.  Some types of unloaders on large cylinde rs placed side by side are difficult to access. 
 6.8.1.5 The overbore allowance is 0.062" over the original diameter on all Siemens Energy HSRC 
Products. 
 6.8.1.6 Although Siemens Energy’s standard for thread ed holes in castings is 1-1/2 times the stud 
diameter, there are a few cases on the HOS and HOSS cylinders which do not meet this criteria.

Paragraph                                                                    Comment  
 
6.8.2.1 Some large cylinders require a cylinder sup port which attaches to the outer head.  On packaged 
units, smaller cylinders are normally supported on ly from the outer end of  the distance piece. 
 6.8.2.2 All cylinders (except billets) will normally be s upplied without liners.  Minimum liner thickness is .25" 
for cylinders up to 9.5" diameter. 
 6.8.2.3 Finish of typical lubricated compressor cylinder bores is 32RMS. 
 
6.8.3.1 HOS and HOSS cylinders with water jacket s are available.  All forms of cooling can be 
accommodated by these cylinder water jackets. 
 
6.8.3.4.1 Refer to 6.8.3.1.  
6.8.4.1.10 HOS and HOSS cylinders utilize an extend ed plug with a hex head to reduce fixed clearances 
within a given cylinder. 
 
6.8.4.1.12 Siemens Energy only supplies mating flange s and gaskets for the 6000# lens type flanges found on 
the H.P. billet cylinders. 
 
6.8.4.1.15 Siemens Energy’s standard  is 90RMS or 100-150 circular fini sh.  All inlet/outlet flanges are ANSI 
standard with the exception of the HOS/HOSS clamshell cylinders. 
 
6.8.4.2.5 Rectangular flange and bolting dimensions for clamshell cylinders can be found on the cylinder 
outline drawings provided to the Resellers.  Ring type joints w ill be found on all 4000 psi billet 
cylinders and lens flanges on the 6000 psi billet cylinders. 
 
6.9.1.3 Siemens Energy valves are not 100% polarized .  The valves are designed with a capscrew that 
protrudes from the valve on the bac k side of the valve to prevent valves from being installed upside 
down.  In the event a valve was installed upside  down, this capscrew would contact the piston 
during barover inspection and prevent crankshaft ro tation alerting operators that the valves are 
installed improperly.  An inlet valve cannot be in stalled into a discharge valve port because the 
nose of the valve is too large in diameter.  Shoul d a discharge valve inadvertently be installed in a 
suction valve hole, the valve will not co mpletely seat, so no damage can occur. 
 
6.9.1.5 On a non-conventional cylinder  such as the DDV series, the valves are placed, by design, in the 
cylinder bore. 
 
6.9.1.6 Siemens Energy provides no such valve installation/removal tool. 
 6.10.2.1 The piston rod is not positively locked to the crosshead on any Siemens Energy HSRC compressor 
design. 
 6.10.3.2 HOS and HOSS cylinders are furnished with combination rings, which act as both the wear band 
and sealing ring.  These assemblies are designed for bearing loads under 15 psig.  Wear bands 
and piston rings, designed for the specified beari ng load limits, are available as an option. 
 
6.10.4.1 HOS and HOSS cylinders will have the piston rod induction hardened in the area of interest.  A 
tungsten carbide coating (TC3) is available for all Siemens Energy HSRC Products. 
 
6.11.3 The HOS relies on achieving the prescribed bolt stretch to keep the joint tight.

Paragraph                                                                    Comment  
 
6.11.4 HOS and HOSS models utilize a box style cr osshead of ASTM A536 Grade 65-45-12.  This 
material offers higher strength, durability and better castability than the cast steel.  HOS 
compressors use integral, non-adjustable shoes as standard.  Replaceable shim adjustable shoe 
crossheads are available for HOS models.  HOSS models have shim adjustable shoes as standard. 
 6.12.2.3 The distance pieces are designed for a maximum pressure of 25 psig.   
 
6.12.2.4 On packaged units, a common vent/drain may be ut ilized at the bottom of the distance piece, if the 
gas is heavier than air.  Vent may be smaller than  the 1-1/2" npt specified.  Packing gland cooling 
connections are inlet at the bottom of the distance piece and outlet at the top to avoid formation of 
air pockets in the packing. 
 
6.12.2.5 External connections may be smaller than the 1" npt specified. 
 6.12.2.7 In addition to the Austenitic stainless steel t ubing and fittings, Siemens Energy may employ a teflon 
flexible hose with stainless steel braid on pressures below 3000 psi. 
 6.13.2.3 The HOS/HOSS uses cooled packings for lubricat ed cylinders with MAWP of 2000 psig or greater 
as standard.  Cooled packings avail able for all cylinders upon request.   
 6.14.2.1.1 For pressurized oil systems,  temperatures up to 180°F are acceptable provided the proper grade of 
oil is being used. 
 6.14.2.1.2 Lubrication system is not built in accordance with API-614. 
 
6.14.2.1.4 j. Standard Siemens Energy relief valves hav e a cast iron body and hardened steel internals.  
                          Any other available combination can be provided at an additional cost. 
 k. HOS and HOSS uses carbon steel upstream of the filter and 300 series stainless tubing with 
  carbon steel fittings downstream.  
6.14.2.1.5 Shell and tube cool ers utilize cast iron bonnets. 
 6.14.2.3 b. Siemens Energy standar d coolers are not TEMA Class C, but these can be supplied for an 
                          additional cost. 
 c. .375 diameter tubes with wall thickness of 22, 24 & 25 BWG and not the 18 BWG as specified. 
 
6.14.2.4 a. All Siemens Energy HSRC Products are 25 micron particle size. 
 6.14.2.6 Standard Siemens Energy relief valves are lo cated outside the crankc ase and have a cast iron 
body with hardened steel internals.  All compressors have their return lines entering the pump 
suction and do not dump back into the crankcase. 
 
6.14.2.7 Siemens Energy does not supply an oil temperature regulator as standard. 
 6.14.3.2.2 a. A resettable spring-loaded indicator pin for ea ch outlet is not standard but is available.  Instead, 
  Siemens Energy supplies a cycle pin indicator on the distribution block which indicates proper  
  cycling.  d. A cycle monitor is not provided.

6.15.1.11 Siemens Energy does not consider external fast eners or fasteners internal to the distance piece to 
fall within NACE guidelines.  Therefore, Siemens Energy does not require special bolting for these 
components, however, these items can be supp lied if required in the specifications. 
 
6.15.2.1 Siemens Energy reviews cylinder designs wi th the aid of modern engineering analysis tools to 
determine cylinder MAWP.  Siemens Energy has su ccessfully applied nodul ar iron as a cylinder

 7.7.3.1 Internal oil feed lines (when pressures are le ss than 3000 psi) may be stainless steel braided teflon 
hose. 
 7.7.7.2 Vent connections in  the packing case and interc onnecting tubing will be either  a 3/8" stainless steel 
braided hose, 1/4" - 300 series stainless st eel tubing x .065" wall, depending on discharge 
pressures. 
 
7.11.1 A "tool kit" specifically designed for each of the compressor models is provided in a "ship loose" kit.

nose of the valve is too large in diameter.  Shoul d a discharge valve inadvertently be installed in a 
suction hole, the valve will not comple tely seat, so no damage can occur. 
 
6.9.1.5 On a non-conventional cylinder  such as the DDV series, the valves are placed, by design, in the 
cylinder bore. 
 
6.9.1.6 Siemens Energy provides no such valve installation/removal tool.

ring.  These assemblies are designed for bearing loads under 15 psig.  Wear bands and piston rings, designed for the specified bearing load limits, are available as an option. 
  
6.10.4.1 MOS piston rods are not c oated or hardened as standard.  A tungsten carbide coating (TC3) is 
available for all Siemens Energy Separable Products. 
 
6.11.4 The MOS compressor utilizes a box style cros shead of ASTM A536 Grade 65-45-12.  This material 
offers higher strength, durability and better castability than  the cast steel.  MO S uses integral, non-
adjustable shoes as standard. 
 6.12.1.1 MOS compressors ar e supplied without a distance piece as standard. 
 
6.12.2.3 The distance pieces are design ed for a maximum pressure of 25 psig. 
 
6.12.2.4 On packaged units, a common vent/drain may be ut ilized at the bottom of the distance piece, if the 
gas is heavier than air.  Vent connections may be smaller than the 1-1/2" npt specified.  Packing 
gland cooling connections are inlet at the bottom of the distance piece and outlet at the top to avoid 
formation of air pockets in the packing.

Gas Field Policy 23:  Non-Lube Service 
 
The following criteria must be met before a Siemens Ener gy compressor can be offered for non-lube service:  
 
1. Discharge pressures are generally limited to 1500 PSIG. 
 
2. Average piston speeds ar e not to exceed 750 ft/min. 
 
3. Distance pieces are required. 
 
  4.   Oil slingers must be provided on all piston rods . To accommodate these, dist ance pieces are required on 
        the MOS and extra long distance pieces ma y be required on HOS/HOSS depending on the cylinder size  
        and/or pressure rating. 
   5.   Packing cases must be water cooled when discharge pressures exceed 250 psig. 
 
  6.   Cylinder bores must have a 16 RM S special finish and be sprayed with teflon. 
 
  7.   Piston rods to be coated only when application absolutely requires it. 
   8.   There may be special requirements beyond what is normally required for lubed applications such as 
        cylinder liners, special pistons, distance pieces, etc. 
   9.   Estimated actual discharge gas temperature is no t to exceed 250° F for gas cooled cylinders and 300° F  
        for water cooled cylinders. 
 10.   Process vessels and piping must be carefully desi gned to prevent liquids and foreign debris from entering  
        the compressor. They must be very carefull y cleaned prior to mounting on the compressor packaged unit.  
        Siemens Energy also recommends that a coat ing such as Hunting Industrial #8101 (or equal) be applied  
        to all vessels and gas piping to help maintain cleanliness. Foreign debris from the vessels or piping along  
        with liquids can form a greasy paste that has  the potential to block the vent ing of piston and packing rings 
        and/or adhere to the cylinder bore and valves with a detrimental effect on service life. 
 
11.   Abrasive fines from such things  as molecular sieves or desiccant dryers, glass or ceramics from towers or  
        columns, etc. must be eliminated or at least filtered to below 1 micron. 
 
12.   Siemens Energy will provide the non-lubricat ed compressor cylinders and packing cases drilled for 
        lubricated service and plugged. In the ev ent that the Process Gas Syst em requirements cannot be  
        achieved to provide acc eptable service life, this will facilitate c onversion to lubricated construction and  
       operation if necessary.  
13.   Wear parts in non-lubricated compressor cylinders  typically experience shorter service life than do wear  
        parts in lubricated compressor cylinders which tr anslates into more frequent maintenance stoppages. The  
        user should ensure they have an adequate supply of replacement parts on hand to avoid unnecessary    
        down time. 
 14.   Start-up procedures must be submitted to Siemens Energy for review.

Gas Field Policy 26:  Order Cancellation Policy 
 
When a purchase order is received, it is accepted in good faith. In order to meet our quoted ship date, 
immediate action is required by multiple departments. This  includes Engineering, Bill of Material generation and 
material planning with the ordering of any long lead-time components, and Production Planning. A Purchase 
Order cancellation, even very early within the order, has  a significant cost impact on  the factory. Likewise, a 
Purchase Order cancellation later in the schedule usually  results in a loss of factory productive capacity. 
 
For these reasons, Siemens Energy has established t he amount of Cancellation Charges as a percentage of the 
total order value relative to the percentage of time elapsed for the scheduled delivery of an order. See Siemens 
Energy Form MD001.  
When notification is received that an order is to be he ld up, cancellation charges based upon this schedule will 
be presented to the Purchaser to assist him in determini ng whether to cancel the order or proceed with work. An 
indefinite "hold up" is not acceptable.  An early decision must be reached as to cancellation or release to 
complete the equipment. Upon cancellation, all material becomes the property of the Supplier. 
 Additional cancellation charges may apply to orders that  have very specialized equipment and will be addressed 
on a case-by-case basis. Likewise, orders that have special circumstances will be reviewed on a case-by-case 
basis.  
Major changes to orders after entry, such as cylinder size or type changes -- or frame stroke changes -- will also 
be evaluated for cancellation charges on a case-by-case basis.

Gas Field Policy 27:  ISO 13631 (E), August 1, 2002,  Comments / Exceptions 
 
Paragraph      Comments 
 
3.7  Siemens Energy defines MAWP as the maximum continuous gauge pressure for which the 
manufacturer nameplates it's compressors (o r relevant part thereof) when handling the 
specified fluid at the specified temperature.  It is also the maximum relief valve setting. 
 
3.10  Siemens Energy defines RDP (rated discharge pressure) as being MAWP/1.10 or MAWP - 25 
PSIG (1.8 kg/cm2) whichever is greater. I.E., a cylinder would have an RDP of 1000 PSIG (70.3 
kg/cm2) and a MAWP of 1100 PSIG (77.3 kg/cm2) - or a cylinder with a MAWP of 100 PSIG (7.0 
kg/cm2) would have an RDP of 75 PSIG (5.3 kg/cm2). The MAWP is the controlling rating.  
 
3.11  Siemens Energy Sizing performance program calculates "Rated Power" by assuming some 
general pressure drops for each of these factors. Each Reseller designs their own pulsation 
suppression devices, orifices, process piping, in tercoolers and separators. Siemens Energy will 
not be responsible for errors granted via outside suppliers equipment. 
 
3.13   Capacity can be expressed with no negative tolerance if so specified. 
 3.15  Volume flow referred to 0.1013 Mpa (1.013 bar A) and a temperature of 0° C (32° F) if so 
specified. 
 6.3  Discharge temperatures can be limited to 135°  C (275° F) if so spec ified. Siemens Energy 
sizing program flags T (adiabatic) @300° F (149° C) and T (estimated actual) at the cylinder 
design limit of 350° F (177° C). Both temperatures are shown on standard output form. 
 
6.4.1.2  Siemens Energy calculates gas rod load at  the compressor flange at 0 and 180 degrees. Gas 
rod load can be calculated at relief valve set pressure, if specified. 
 
6.5.1.1  Siemens Energy compressor cylinder "maxim um allowable working pressure" (MAWP) exceeds 
the "rated discharge pressure" (RDP) by 10% or as a minimum 25 PSI (1.8 kg/cm
2).

diameter or larger and all  cylinders with HOVVCP. 
 
6.5.2.3.3  Siemens limitation is -51° C (-60° F) before  special stud material is required. For temperatures 
of -20° C (4° F) but warmer than -51° C (-60° F) , Siemens Energy can supply special material at 
an extra price. Note that stainless steel metallic  valve plates are required on PF valves for 
temperatures colder than -29° C (-20° F). 
 
6.5.3.1  Siemens Energy 26.0" (660.4 mm), 26. 5” (673.1 mm) and 28.0" (711.2 mm) HOS/HOSS 
cylinders have a machined rectangular studded flange. Forged steel billet cylinders to 4400 PSI (309.4 kg/cm
2) MAWP typically use "ring joint" flanges . Forged steel billet cylinders from 4400 
psi (309.4 kg/cm2) to 6600 PSI (464.0 kg/cm2) MAWP use "lens" style connections. 
 6.6.2.1  Siemens Energy Model PF valves ar e not 100% polarized. Should a discharge valve 
inadvertently be installed in a suction valve hol e; the valve will not completely seat so no 
damage can occur. 
 
6.7.1 Siemens Energy standard does not include provision to positively lock piston rods into

Gas Field Policy 29:  Maintenance 
 
 
ROUTINE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE  
 
High speed reciprocating compressors are designed and built for long periods of continuous and reliable full-load operation.  It should be equipped with automatic safety devices to protect it and shut it down in case of low frame oil pressure, vibration, extreme temperatures or pressures and lack of cylinder lubrication.  It can also be equipped with addi tional safety devices to obtain practically any 
degree of protection desired pending on the service and/or owner requirements. 
 When the unit is first placed in operation and the machine is operating at normal speed and load and with stable operating pressures and temperatures, all safety alarm and shutdown controls should be carefully checked for correct operation and adjust ed where necessary.  Never disconnect the safety 
shutdown devices and allow the unit to run unprotected. 
 
Every compressor requires a certain amount of super vision and care if it is to give continued 
satisfactory performance and long service life.  A time schedule of duties for the operator must be subject to alteration by experience to fit the actual conditions and operating environment.  The following minimum schedule is suggested based on the continuous duty of 720 hours per month. 
 
 
NOTE  
 
The time schedule of routine inspections and maintenance for the 
compressor must be used in conjunction with the schedule and duties 
recommended by the driver manufacturer for this machine.  This also applies to the other accessory equipment. 
 
 
Daily:  
 
1. Keep the exterior of the compressor/driver clean, as well as the surrounding work area. 
 
2. Check the oil level in the frame sump and add the proper oil as required to maintain the level 
at the oil level line on the gauge.  Check that the oil tank (if so equipped) is also filled to the proper level. 
 
3. Check the oil level in the lubricator drive box and add the proper oil as necessary.  If the oil 
level has increased, then check the pumps for leakage past the plungers.  Make sure that all the pumping units are working and also inspect the distribution blocks for leakage, indicator pins “popped up”, or other problems. 
 4. Keep a daily log of all gas temperatures, water temperatures and gauge pressures.  One of 
the principal means of keeping track of the physical condition of a compressor and its 
equipment is by these daily log readings.  Watch carefully for any marked changes which indicate that further attention is warranted.  Use the interstage pressures and temperatures to detect abnormal conditions.  A decrease in the interstage pressure and temperature means that the lower pressure cylinder has reduced capacity.  An increase in interstage pressure and 
temperature means that the next higher stage cylinder has reduced capacity.  These effects 
can be attributed to leaking valves, worn piston rings or broken parts.

NOTE  
 
In every case, because of variable operating conditions, the operator should establish the frequency of draining off the various drains.  This frequency will be determined by the amount of liquid that collects at each drain point. 
 
5. If separators are used in the compressor system, a schedule must be established whereby 
they are periodically drained to prevent any liquid carryover into the compressor cylinders, which can cause serious damage.  If automatic drains are furnished, check them for proper operation and be sure that no liquid has accumulated in the level gauge. 
 
6. Watch for signs of excessive heating and listen for any unusual noises while the machine is 
operating.  Any abnormal condition should be investigated immediately. 
 7. Visually inspect the unit for loose fasteners and supports or for any excessive shaking from 
tubing or hoses and secure where appropriate. 
 
8. Check all the gas, water and oil piping for leaks. 
 
 
First Week:  
 
1. Visually inspect and spot check with torque wrenches, the fasteners on joints with gaskets and 
the entire cylinder to frame bolting with the unit shut down.  Take note of any fasteners that have loosened and pay close attention to these fasteners.  Increase the periodic checking of these fasteners if necessary. 
 
2. Visually inspect all the loaded joints for motion across the joint (winking) during operation.  
Tighten the fasteners as required following the procedures outlined in CHAPTER 5 GENERAL DATA AND SPECIFICATIONS Section 5-3, in this Instruction Manual. 
 
3. Check the runout of the compressor piston rods.  Make sure the piston rod is not scored, 
scratched or discolored. 
 4. Check the oil scraper packing, piston rod packing and distance piece vents for excessive 
blowby and/or oil leakage.  If blowby is occurring, determine the cause and if required, replace 
the packing rings. 
 5. Check for adequate cylinder and packing lubrication.  This may require the removal of the 
outer head and/or valve covers.  Compressors typically leave the factory with the cylinder lubrication system set at the maximum flow rate for break-in.  Refer to Section 2-3.4 in this Instruction Manual before reducing the flow rate.

NOTE  
 
When the compressor is being operated in an extremely dirty 
atmosphere, or where it is installed outdoors, operated intermittently, 
handling foul gas in the cylinders, or operating with high oil temperatures in a very hot atmosphere, it may be necessary to change the oil more often.  Most reputable oil companies offer laboratory analysis of oil samples, the use of this type service is recommended. 
 
1. Take a sample of the frame oil for analysis.  Compare the oil analysis to a clean reference 
sample.  Change the oil and oil filter per the analysis or per the compressor manufacturer's recommendations. Refer to Chapter 2 Section 2-2.8. 
 2. Visually inspect all the loaded joints for motion across the joint (winking) during operation.  
Tighten the fasteners as required following the procedures outlined in CHAPTER 5 GENERAL 
DATA AND SPECIFICATIONS Section 5-3, in this Instruction Manual. 
 3. Visually check the oil scraper packing, piston rod packing and distance piece vents for 
excessive blow-by and/or oil leakage. 
 
 
Every Three Months (ALL Monthly Checks Plus):  
 
1. Check all of the safety shutdowns and the operation of the loading and unloading devices for 
proper operation. 
 
2. Lubricate all of the variable volume clearance pocket (VVCP) packing grease fittings (See CHAPTER 4 MAINTENANCE Section 4-19.2 in this Instruction Manual) and check for free motion by moving the pocket in and out with the unit not operating.  Reset the pocket to the 
correct clearance setting. 
 
3. Check the frame crankcase breather(s) and clean or replace as necessary. 
 
4. Clean the lubricator reservoir and pumping units as necessary or according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
 
5. Check the compressor piston rings and piston rod for wear and the cylinder bore for scoring, 
and remove any accumulation of foreign material.  Replace the piston rings if they are worn to their limit.  Benchmark the wear data.  See CHAPTER 4 MAINTENANCE Section 4-14, in this 
Instruction Manual for the proper procedures on checking the wear rate of, and renewing, 
PTFE piston and rider rings. 
 
6. Clean the separator sight glasses (if so equipped). 
 
7. Utilizing a temperature measuring gun, measure the temperature of the valve covers; record 
and benchmark all the data.

8. Check the frame and driver foundation bolts for tightness.  Follow the required procedures and 
tighten to the proper torque values given in CHAPTER 5 GENERAL DATA AND 
SPECIFICATIONS Section 5-3, found in this Instruction Manual. 
 
9. Inspect the drive coupling.  Replace any worn or broken components.  Tighten as required. 
 
 
Every Six Months (ALL Three Month Checks Plus):  
 
1. Check the crankshaft end play. 
 
2. Inspect the piston rod, pressure packing and oil scraper case for discoloration or excessive 
leakage.  Replace the rings as required. 
 3. Replace the cylinder lubricator filters.  
 
Annually (ALL Six Month Checks Plus):  
 
1. Check all of the running gear clearances and compare them to the benchmark readings.  If a 
change is detected, disassemble and inspect those affected parts.  Replace any bearings and/or bushings where necessary. 
 2. Clean and flush the oil cooler and any other heat exchanger supplied.  
3. Check the accuracy of the compressor pressure gauges and recalibrate them as required. 
4. Remove all of the inlet and discharge valves.  Clean and inspect the valves for excessive wear 
and broken parts.  Lap the seats and guards and replace all internal parts.  Refer to the compressor valve instructions located in CHAPTER 4 MAINTENANCE Section 4-18 in this Instruction Manual. 
 
5. Remove the compressor piston and piston rod assemblies and inspect the piston rods, 
pistons, piston rings and cylinder bore diameters.  Record the cylinder bore diameters.  Replace components where necessary.  Inspections of this nature will indicate the replacement schedule for parts that are subject to wear. 
 
6. Safety valves used in the compressor gas system should have their settings tested at least 
once a year, and more often under extreme conditions, by a hydraulic test. 
 7. Examine any separators, bottles, dampers and similar equipment that may be used in the 
compressor system for accumulation of dirt, rust and other foreign material.  Remove the 
vessel from the system and clean it if necessary. 
 8. Visually inspect the packing cups; re-lap as required; replace pressure packing and oil wiper 
rings.

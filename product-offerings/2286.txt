Gas Field Policy 17:  Low Temperature Service 
 
GENERAL: 
 
High Speed Reciprocating Compressors wi th standard construction may be applied to temperatures -20°F and 
above.   
Applications below -20°F must be reviewed by Siem ens Energy Marketing Group pr ior to quoting. (In most 
cases, aluminum pistons must have a slightly oversi ze O.D.; the allowable cylinder working pressure and 
differential pressure limits must be redu ced; an ethylene-glycol static cylinde r jacket cooling must be used with 
all water cooled cylinders.  
 
INLET GAS PREHEAT:  
A:  Cylinders with Gas Cooling: 
 
The following method for estimating inlet preheat app lies to all Siemens Energy gas field compressors 
using cylinders with gas cooling.

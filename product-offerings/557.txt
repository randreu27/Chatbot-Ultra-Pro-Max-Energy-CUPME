The first three turbine stages are thermal barrier-coated. Your benefit: long service life and low maintenance. High fuel flexibility The SGT5-4000F offers dual fuel capability and tolerates fuels within a wide Wobbe range. You might need to adjust the burner configuration when the Wobbe index of the fuel gas varies by more than ±15%. The SGT5-4000F combustion system is able to handle different fuel compositions, e.g. natural gas with high contents on hydrogen (up to 30 vol%), propane, ethylene and butane, as well as inert gases (N 2 , CO 2 , He, Ar, etc.). Furthermore, the SGT5-4000F combustion system is able to run on fuels with higher amounts of impurities, such as hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) of up to 4000 ppm. The fuel system can switch over quickly between fuel gas and fuel oil and vice versa. Power output augmentation Wet Compression option Wet Compression (WetC) increases the power output by injecting water into the gas turbine inlet. This optional SGT5-4000F feature can be used for peak-load machines to benefit from high electricity prices WetC enhances the turbine performance by reducing compressor inlet temperatures and increasing the mass flow throughout the turbine. Excess fog droplets evaporate in the compressor and produce an additional intercooling effect. Chiller System option The chiller is a heat exchanger, which cools down the compressor intake air in order to increase the gas turbine base load performance. The system can decrease the compressor inlet temperature far below the dew point of the ambience. A chiller system can generate benefits in dry regions, where the high water consumption of other inlet air cooling options is undesirable. Evaporative Cooling option The system decreases compressor inlet temperature through humidification, raises relative humidity and increases the air mass flow, resulting in higher turbine output power and efficiency. Evaporative cooling is the favorable system in dry and hot ambient. High steam raising capability With its high steam raising capability, the SGT5-4000F is excellently suited for cogeneration or combined heat an power (CHP) applications, e.g, for seawater desalination process steam district heating For combined cycle applications with CHP, you can use a condensing or backpressure steam turbine, with or without steam extraction. Proven in commercial operation The SGT5-4000F entered the market in 1996. Today, more than 360 turbines are sold worldwide, and the installed fleet has an accumulated fleet experience of more than 23 million equivalent operating hours (EOHs).

Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  19 I. Introduction  
The managing board of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft with its registered offices in Berlin and Munich 
("Siemens  AG") resolved with the approval of the supervisory board of 22  May 2020 to legally 
separate ( verselbständigen ) the worldwide Gas and Power operations described in detail in this 
Spin-off Report (" Siemens Gas and Power Business ") to be legally separ ated of the group 
currently formed by Siemens  AG and its subsidiaries (" Siemens Group ", its companies  each 
"Siemens Group Companies ") and the approximately 67  % stake held by the Siemens Group in 
the listed Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy,  S.A. (" SGRE  S.A." and, together with its 
subsidiaries, " SGRE ") under a German stock corporation ( Aktiengesellschaft ), i.e., Siemens 
Energy AG with its registered office in Munich (" Siemens Energy  AG"). Hereinafter, the business 
of SGRE (" SGRE Business ") and the Siemens Gas and Power Business are jointly referred to as 
"Siemens Energy Business ". 
55 % of the shares in Siemens Energy  AG (" Siemens Energy Shares ") are to be transferred to the 
shareholders of Siemens  AG by way of a spin -off in accordance with the German Transf ormation 
Act ( Umwandlungsgesetz , "UmwG "). Immediately after the Spin -off takes effect, it is planned for 
the Siemens Energy Shares to be admitted to trading on the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange and , additionally,  in the sub -segment of th e Regulated Market of the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange with additional post -admission obligations (Prime Standard).  
As a result of the legal separation, Siemens  AG intends to no longer exercise any control over 
Siemens Energy  AG so that the Siemens Energy Busi ness will cease to be part  of the Siemens 
Group. Siemens  AG will initially remain a non -controlling anchor shareholder in Siemens 
Energy  AG with a 35.1  % shareholding directly and indirectly via its wholly owned subsidiary 
Siemens Beteiligungen Inland GmbH  ("SBI GmbH "). Additionally, the Siemens Pension 
Trust  e.V. ("SPT e.V.") will hold a 9.9  % stake in Siemens Energy  AG. With the strategic and 
operational development of Siemens Energy  AG and Siemens  AG, Siemens  AG intends to reduce 
its stake in Siemens Energy  AG significantly in a timeframe of twelve to 18 months after the Spin -
off taking effect.  
The legal separation of the Siemens Energy Business under  Siemens Energy  AG is to be 
implemented by taking the following key steps:  
 As described in m ore detail in Chapter  V.1., the Siemens Energy Business was legally and 
organizationally consolidated under Siemens Gas and Power GmbH  & Co. KG with its 
registered office in Munich, registered with the register of companies ( Handelsregister ) at 
the distric t court ( Amtsgericht ) of Munich under registration number HRA  111200 and to 
be renamed Siemens Energy Global GmbH  & Co. KG (" Siemens Energy  KG") ("Carve -
out"). The sole personally liable partner (general partner) of Siemens Energy  KG is 
Siemens Gas and Pow er Management GmbH, registered with the register of companies at 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  20 the district court of Munich under registration number HRB  241345 (" General Partner 
GmbH "). Siemens  AG currently holds approximately  87.98  % partnership interest in the 
fixed capital of Sieme ns Energy  KG as well as a corresponding percentage of the shares in 
the share capital of General Partner GmbH. SBI GmbH , a wholly -owned subsidiary of 
Siemens  AG with its registered office in Munich and registered with the register of 
companies at the distr ict court of Munich under registration number HRB  139644, holds 
the remaining interest in the amount of approximately  12.02  %in the fixed capital of 
Siemens Energy  KG and a corresponding percentage of the shares in the share capital of 
General Partner GmbH.  
 In advance, SBI GmbH and Siemens  AG will contribute (partial) partnership interests in 
Siemens Energy  KG and shares in General Partner GmbH in the total amount of 45  % of 
the fixed capital and the share capital of the relevant company in return for b eing granted 
shares in Siemens Energy  AG (" Capital Increases in Kind "). Through this, the 
participation in Siemens Energy  AG will be created, which will initially be held, directly 
and indirectly, by Siemens  AG. To this end, Siemens Energy  AG will increase  its capital 
stock  in total  from EUR  100,000 by EUR  326,890, 337 to EUR  326,990,337 . 
 Finally, the partnership interest in Siemens Energy  KG of 55  % of the fixed capital , having 
initially remained  with Siemens  AG, and the shares in General Partner GmbH, like wise 
having initially  remain ed with Siemens  AG, will be transferred to Siemens Energy  AG by 
way of a spin -off by absorption ( Abspaltung zur Aufnahme ) under the UmwG (" Spin -off"). 
 Thus, all partnership interests in Siemens Energy  KG and all shares in General Partner 
GmbH will be transferred to Siemens Energy  AG by way of the Capital Increases in Kind 
and the Spin -off. 
 As consideration in the context of the Spin -off, Siemens Energy  AG will issue to the 
shareholders of Siemens  AG, preserving the proporti onate shareholdings, a total of 
399,654,856  shares of no-par value  (registered shares ( Namensaktien )) in Siemens 
Energy  AG. In order to carry out the Spin -off, Siemens Energy  AG will increase its capital 
stock by additional EUR  399,654,856  to EUR  726,645,1 93 ("Spin -off Capital Increase "). 
The shares to be issued to the shareholders of Siemens  AG in order to carry out the Spin -
off are to equate to 55  % of Siemens Energy  AG's future capital stock existing after the 
Spin-off Capital Increase and the Capital In creases in Kind. Upon the Spin -off taking 
effect, the remaining 45  % of the future capital stock of Siemens Energy  AG will initially 
be held by Siemens  AG, in part directly and in part indirectly through its wholly -owned 
subsidiary SBI GmbH, whereby in con nection with the Spin -off a share holding  of 9.9  % 
of the future capital stock of Siemens Energy AG is to be transferred from Siemens AG to 
SPT e.V.

Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  21  The Siemens Energy Business will continue to use the brand "Siemens". To this end, brand 
licensing agreement s have been entered into between Siemens  AG and Siemens 
Energy  KG and between Siemens  AG and SGRE  S.A. 
 It is Siemens  AG's intention, upon the Spin -off taking effect, not to exert any controlling 
influence over Siemens Energy  AG and not to include Siemens E nergy  AG in its 
consolidated financial statements. The intended termination of control will be contractually 
ensured by way of an agreement with Siemens Energy  AG (" Deconsolidation  
Agreement "). 
 Immediately after the Spin -off takes effect, it is planned for all shares of Siemens 
Energy  AG to be admitted to trading on the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock 
Exchange and, additionally,  in the sub -segment of the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange with additional post -admission obligations (Prime Standard).  
The basis of the Spin -off is the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement entered into between Siemens  AG 
and Siemens Energy  AG and notarized before Dr.  Tilman Götte, notary with offices in  Munich, on 
22 May 2020 ( "Spin -off and Transfer Agreement "). The Spin -off and Transfer Agreement and 
its Annexes are enclosed with this Spin -off Report  as Annex . The Spin -off and Transfer Agreement 
requires , inter alia , the approval of the shareholders' me etings of Siemens  AG and Siemens 
Energy  AG in order to be valid and is intended to be submitted to the extraordinary shareholders' 
meeting of Siemens  AG for approval by resolution on 9  July 2020. The approval of the 
shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy  AG will be granted in advance by Siemens  AG in its 
capacity as the sole shareholder of Siemens Energy  AG. 
The Spin -off is intended to be implemented (subject to a postponement of the effective date in the 
event of a delay in the Spin -off taking effect, as provided for in the Spin -off and Transfer 
Agreement) with retroactive economic effect from 1  April 2020, 0 .00 hours. It will take effect upon 
registration with both registers of companies of Siemens  AG. 
Upon the Spin -off taking effect, Siemens Energy  AG will become the parent company of the newly 
established Siemens Energy Group (Siemens Energy  AG together with its direct and indirect 
subsidiaries existing after the Spin -off, " Future Siemens Energy Group "; each of its companies, 
"Future Siemens Energy Gro up Company "; the Siemens Group without the companies of the 
Future Siemens Energy Group, " Future Siemens Group "; each of its companies, " Future 
Siemens Group Company "). For the purposes of this Spin -off Report, SPT  e.V. is also deemed 
part of the Future Si emens Group.  
The diagram below gives a simplified overview of the target structure that is to be achieved 
immediately upon the Spin -off taking effect (including the transfer of shares to SPT e.V.; the chart 
does not depict the General Partner GmbH):

3. Business Activities of the Siemens Group  
 Overview  
In the fiscal year ended 30  September 2019, the business a ctivities of the Siemens Group were 
reorganized and have since then comprised the following six industrial businesses as  reportable  
segments: Digital Industries (" Digital Industries "), Smart Infrastructure (" Smart 
Infrastructure "), Gas and Power (" Gas and Power "), Mobility (" Mobility "), Siemens

corresponds to the SGRE Business. The industrial businesses are supported by the three service 
businesses SFS, Siemens Real Estate and Global Business Services, whereby services are not only 
provided for Siemens units but to some extent also for external customers . SFS also constitutes  a 
separate reportable segment.  Conversely , Siemens Real Estate and Global Business Services are 
not sepa rately reportable. Moreover, Siemens Group reports in Portfolio Companies businesses that 
are managed separately.  
In the Half-Year Financial Report  as of 31  March 2020, on account of the envisaged Spin -off, the 
Siemens Gas and Power Business and the SGRE B usiness are reported  as assets held for disposal  
and discontinued operations . 
The overall operations of the Siemens Group can be described  using  the following key data:

 Digital Industries  
Digital Industries offers a comprehensive product portfolio and system solutions for automation 
used in discrete manufacturing and process industries. These include automation systems and 
software for factories, numerical control systems, motors, drive systems and inverters as well as 
integrated automation systems for machine tools and production machines. Digital In dustries also 
offers process control systems, machine -to-machine communication products, sensors (including 
sensors measuring pressure, temperature, level, flow rate, distance or shape) as well as radio 
frequency identification systems. Furthermore, Digita l Industries offers product and production 
lifecycle software, and software for simulation and testing of mechatronic systems. The product 
range is complemented by the electronic design automation software portfolio of Mentor Graphics 
(Mentor) and the open , cloud -based industrial Internet -of-Things (IoT) operating system

growth and accelerate sales of MindSphere, Digital Industries acquired Mendix group (Mendix ) at 
the beginning of fiscal year 2019.  
Digital Industries also provides customers with lifecycle and data -driven services. Taken together, 
the product range enables customers to optimize their entire value chains – from product design 
and development to production and post -sale service. In particular with its advanced software 
solutions, Digital Industries supports customers in discrete manufacturing, hybrid and process 
industries in their evolu tion towards a "Digital Enterprise" . which will increase flexibility and 
efficiency of production processes and will speed up the market launch of new products. Among 
its most important customer segments are the automotive industry, the machine building in dustry, 
the pharmaceutical and chemical industry, the food and beverage industry as well as the electronics 
and semiconductor industry. Digital Industries serves its customers through a regional sales 
organization, spanning all its businesses, using variou s sales channels depending on the type of 
customer and industry. Changes in customer demand, especially for standard products, are strongly 
driven by macroeconomic cycles, and can lead to significant short -term fluctuation in Digital 
Industries' profitabil ity. Digital Industries' competitors can be divided into two groups: 
multinational companies which have a relatively broad product portfolio and companies which are 
active only in certain regional  or product related markets.  
The following overview shows th e key figures of Digital Industries in  the fiscal year 2019 and in 
the first half of the current fiscal year (1  October 2019 to 31  March 2020):

 Smart Infrastructure  
Smart Infrastructure offers  and intelligently combines energy systems and building technologies, 
to improve efficiency and sustainability and support its customers to address technolog ical shifts. 
Smart Infrastructure brings together energy supply – from intelligent control of the grid and low - 
and medium -voltage electrification to control products – with building technology: from building 
automation to fire safety and security to energy efficiency. The "Grid Edge", which means the edge 
of the supply grid , provides for high growth markets. These include energy storage, distributed 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  32 energy systems and prosu mption (simultaneous production and consumption  of electricity),  as well 
as electric vehicle infrastructure and locally separated small grid systems  (micro grids) . Smart 
Infrastructure serves its customers through a broad variety of channels, including its  global product 
and systems sales organization, distributors, switchboard manufacturers, original equipment 
manufacturers, value added resellers and installers, as well as by worldwide direct sales through 
the branch offices of its regional solutions and s ervices units. Smart Infrastructure's customer base 
is diverse. It encompasses infrastructure developers and construction companies, owners, operators 
and tenants of both public and commercial buildings (including hospitals, educational institutions, 
airpo rts and data centers), utilities and power distribution network operators, companies active in 
heavy industries such as oil and gas, mining and chemicals as well as discrete manufacturing 
industries such as automotive and machine building. Smart Infrastruc ture's principal competitors 
consist mainly of large multinational companies together with smaller manufacturers in emerging 
countries. Its solutions and services business also competes with local players such as system 
integrators and with facility manage ment firms. The degree to which Smart Infrastructure's 
businesses are impacted by changes in the overall economic environment differs in each customer 
segment. While customer demand in discrete manufacturing industries changes quickly and 
strongly with mac roeconomic cycles, demand in infrastructure, construction, heavy industries and 
the utilities sector reacts more slowly. Overall, the regional and vertical diversification, the mix of 
products, systems, solutions and services businesses, and its participat ion in both long - and short -
cycle markets, all provide a balanced and resilient business mix.  
With effect from the beginning of the fiscal year 2020, the distribution transformers business was 
allocated to the Siemens Gas and Power Business (see  in detail Chapter  III.2.b)).  
The following overview shows the key figures of Smart Infrastructure in  the fiscal year 2019 and 
in the first half of the current fiscal year (1  October 2019 to 31  March 2020):

 Mobility  
Mobility combines all Siemens Group 's businesses in the area of passenger and freight 
transportation, including rail vehicles, rail automation systems, rail electrification systems, road 
traffic technology, digital solutions and related services. Mobility also provides its customers with 
consu lting, planning, financing, construction, service and operation of turnkey mobility systems. 
Integrated mobility solutions for networking of different types of traffic systems complete the 
product range . Mobility  sells its products, systems and solutions t hrough its worldwide network of 
sales units. The principal customers of Mobility are public and state -owned companies in the 
transportation and logistics sectors. Therefore, the markets served by Mobility are driven primarily 
by public spending. Customers usually have multi -year planning and implementation horizons, and 
their contract tenders therefore tend to be independent of short -term economic trends. Mobility's 
principal competitors are multinational companies. Consolidation among Mobility's competitor s is 
continuing which will probably  further  increase competitive pressure for all rail transport 
businesses, including Mobility.  
The following overview shows the key figures of Mobility in  the fiscal year 2019 and in the first 
half of the current fiscal year (1  October 2019 to 31  March 2020):

 Siemens Healthineers  
In the context  of an Initial Public Offering  on 16  March 2018, Siemens AG put 15  % of its shares 
in Siemens Healthineers AG on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and has since been holding 85  % of 
the shares. Siemens Healthineers is a global leader in providing technology to the healthcare 
industry, inclu ding diagnostic imaging and laboratory diagnostics. It provides medical technology 
and software solutions as well as clinical consulting services, supported by an extensive set of 
training and service offerings. In its imaging business, the most important products are equipment 
for magnetic resonance, computed tomography, X -ray systems, molecular imaging and ultrasound. 
Its diagnostics business offers in -vitro diagnostic products and services to healthcare providers in 
laboratory, molecular and point -of-care diagnostics. The products in its advanced therapies 
business facilitate image -guided minimally invasive treatments, in areas such as cardiology, 
interventional radiology, surgery and radiation oncology. This comprehensive portfolio supports 
customers alo ng the care continuum, from prevention and early detection to diagnosis, treatment 
and follow -up care. Customers range from public and private healthcare providers to 
pharmaceutical companies and clinical research institutes. Competition in the imaging and  
advanced therapies businesses consists mainly of a small number of large multinational companies, 
while the diagnostics market is fragmented with a variety of global players that compete 
internationally across market segments, but that also face competiti on from several regional players 
and companies specialized in niche technologies. The business activities of Siemens Healthineers 
are to a certain extent resilient to short -term economic trends as large portions of its revenue stem 
from recurring business.  They are, however, directly and indirectly dependent on global trends in 
healthcare markets and on developments in health policy, including health care reimbursement 
systems, and on political developments, including regulatory developments.  
The following overview shows the key figures of Siemens Healthineers in  the fiscal year 2019 and 
in the first half of the current fiscal year (1  October 2019 to 31  March 2020):

 The Operating Company Gas and Power  
As reported  in the Annual Report 2019, t he operating company Gas and Power offers a broad 
spectrum of products and solutions for generating electricity, for production, transport and 
downstream operations involving oil and gas, and for installing and operating transm ission grids. 
In addition, it offers a comprehensive set of services related to these products and solutions such as 
performance enhancements, maintenance and consulting services as well as customer training. 
Finally, the Siemens Gas and Power Business off ers comprehensive turnkey solutions that integrate 
the aforementioned products and systems.  
In the power generation and oil & gas businesses, the portfolio includes gas turbines, steam 
turbines, generators to be used in gas or steam power plants, turbo and  reciprocating compressor 
trains, reciprocating engines, modular power supply and integrated power plant solutions, and 
instrumentation and control systems for power generation. Customers include public utilities and 
independent power producers as well as companies which carry out the engineering, procurement 
and construction (" EPC ") of power plants for public utilities and power producers, also sovereign 
and multinational oil and gas companies, midstream operators, independent oil and gas, 
petrochemical an d chemical companies, and industrial customers that generate power and heat for 
their own consumption (prosumers). The competito rs of the Siemens Gas and Power Business in 
this area consist mainly of two groups: a relatively small number of original equipm ent 
manufacturers (OEM)  on the one hand  and a large number of EPC companies  on the other hand . 
In the transmission business, the portfolio includes products, systems and solutions that enable 
reciprocal flow of energy and information between equipment of d ifferent providers. These 
offerings are key building blocks of modern energy grids, which must integrate renewable sources 
with their fluctuating levels of power generation and also allow  efficient electrical storage and 
sophisticated load management. The portfolio also includes power transformers, high voltage 
switchgear and  related  components, high -voltage direct current (HVDC) products and HVDC and 
grid access solutions as well as relevant transmission services. The transmission business serves a

and industrial companies and infrastructure developers in industries such as oil and gas, chemicals, 
mining, data centers, airports, and rail companies. Competitor s in the transmission business consist 
mainly of a small number of large international  companies, increasingly joined by smaller, fast -
growing competitors in emerging countries including China, India and South Korea.

With effect from the beginning of the fiscal year 2020, several business activities were allocated to 
the Siemens Gas and Power Business. These are business activities that were previously included 
in Smart Infrastructure, Portfolio Companies and the centr al unit Corporate Technology (hydrogen -
based technologies) (see  in detail  Chapter  III.2.b)). In addition, certain former business activities 
of the operating company Gas and Power as reported in the fiscal year 2019 - as described in 
Chapter  III.2.c) - were allocated to Portfolio Companies. Therefore, as of 31  March 2020, the 
structure of the Siemens Gas and Power Business, which is shown in the Half-year Financial Report 
2020 of Siemens AG as a distribution  group in accordance with IFRS  5, "Non-current Assets Held 
for Sale and Discontinued Operations " (see Chapter  II.3.f)cc)), is not congruent with the operating 
company Gas and Power as reported in the fiscal year 2019.  
Please refer to Chapters  III.2.b) and III.2.c) regarding the specific structure of the S iemens Gas and 
Power Business to be legally separated as compared to the operating company Gas and Power as 
reported in the fiscal year 2019.  
 The SGRE  Business  
Siemens Group holds approximately 67  % of the shares in  the listed company  SGRE S.A. SGRE  
is active in the field of renewable energies. SGRE  designs, develops , manufactures  and installs  
especially wind turbines for various wind conditions, both onshore and offshore. Furthermore, the 
company develops, constructs and sells wind farms  in selected  markets . In addition, SGRE provides 
services for the management, operation and maintenance of wind farms. Its principal customers are 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  37 large power utilities , independent power producers and project developers in the wind energy 
sector. The competitive situ ation in wind power differs in the two major market segments: In the 
markets for onshore wind farms, there is a variety of suppliers  without any company holding a 
dominant market position. In contrast, markets for offshore wind farms are served by a few 
experienced players of which SGRE is the market leader in this segment. Consolidation is moving 
forward in the area of wind energy generation . Key drivers of consolidation are size, technological 
and market access challenges as well as changes in the awardin g of contracts (auction proceedings).  
SGRE S.A. is actively participating in the consolidation process and has recently acquired parts of 
the Senvion Group for this purpose (with a focus on service business).

CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  44 III. Decision to Legally Separate the Siemens Energy Business by Way of Spin -off and 
Contribution  
When the transfer of the Siemens Energy Business , bundled in Siemens Energy KG , to Siemens 
Energy AG takes effect, the Future Siemens Group with its remaining activities and the Future 
Siemens Energy Group – with the Siemens Energy Business allocated to it that, thus far, belonged 
to the Siemens Group – will be two autonomous groups that are independent of one another.  
However, upon the Spin -off taking effect, Siemens AG will maintain a (direct and indirect) share 
in Siemens Energy AG's capital stock of initially 45  %. The remaining 55  % in Siemens Energy 
AG's capital stock will be al located to the shareholders holding shares in Siemens AG at the time 
of the Spin -off taking effect in proportion to their shareholdings in Siemens  AG. 
The decision of Siemens AG's managing board to submit the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement to 
the company' s extraordinary shareholders' meeting for approval was preceded by a comprehensive 
analysis of the current business activities and structures of the Siemens Group and the Siemens 
Energy Business as well as, based thereon, by an assessment of the strategic options for action. In 
the view of the managing board of Siemens AG, considering all circumstances, it is in the best 
interest of Siemens AG and its shareholders to legally separate the Siemens Energy Business under 
the umbrella of a German stock corporati on, the shares of which are to be listed on the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange. The determinative reasons which, in the view of the managing board of Siemens 
AG, support the legal separation in the context of the further strategic development of the Siemens 
Grou p and Siemens Energy AG and which therefore argue  against  the Siemens Energy Business 
remaining part of the Siemens Group are discussed below. To the extent that business activities 
have been allocated differently from the allocation thus far as reportable  segments, this is explained 
below. Furthermore, the reasons for the decision of  the managing board of Siemens AG in favor of 
a spin -off under the UmwG  are given . Finally, the main reasons are presented that formed the basis 
of the decision of Siemens AG's  managing board to not completely separate itself from the Siemens 
Energy Business in connection with the Spin -off and instead to continue to hold as anchor 
shareholder (after transfer of shares amounting to 9.9  % of the capital stock of Siemens Energy AG 
to SPT e.V.) a participation in Siemens Energy AG, which will be listed in the future. The main 
considerations  that convinced Siemens Energy AG's managing board to decide in favor of the Spin -
off are also presented.  
1. Reasons for the Decision to Legally Sepa rate the Siemens Energy Business  
Against the background of the changing market environment, the operational  requirements for the 
Siemens Energy Business  are changing accordingly . In the view of the managing boards of Siemens 
AG and Siemens Energy AG, the s eparation of the Siemens Energy Business from the Siemens 
Group will give the Future Siemens Energy Group the required  entrepreneurial flexibility to 
directly and continuously adjust the strategic focus and business model to the changing market  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  45 conditions . Furthermore, the direct access to the capital market will provide the Siemens Energy 
Business  with the benefit of additional sources of financing. The managing boards base their 
decision in particular on the following aspects:  
 Changing Market Environment  
The global energy markets are currently experiencing fundamental changes. As a result of climate 
change, in the various markets where  the Siemens Group is active with its Siemens Energy 
Business, the need arises to systematically shift power generation towards low -carbon energy 
sources in order to decrease CO 2 intensity of the entire energy system. At the same time, the demand 
for energy an d specifically for power generation is increasing globally. On the one hand,  this is 
based on a growing world population, increasing globalization  and urbanization . On the other hand, 
the increasing electrification in the areas of commercial trade and indu stry, buildings and traffic 
contributes to this  further . Accordingly, the energy markets are facing major technological 
challenges: The growing demand for energy must be met in a sustainabl e, reliabl e and affordabl e 
manner across all sectors.  
The transitio n towards less carbon -intensive energy sources, specifically electricity generating units 
that use renewable energy sources, is accompanied by various changes:  
 Instead  of central, conventional power generation in adjustable large power plants, power 
genera tion capacities are moving towards a complex system of centralized and 
decentralized power generation with both large power plants and small power plants that 
are mainly based on fluctuating renewable energies.  
 Due to significant state funding, regulation and the related massive technological progress, 
the competitiveness of renewable energies has increased  significantly . Concurrent with the 
increasing competitiveness of renewable energies, new production capacities from 
renewable energies are being created  constantly. This has partly resulted in a disruptive 
change in the energy sector such that conventional large power plants are being 
increasingly replaced by systems for generating electricity from renewable energy sources.  
 The shift from centralized larg e power plants to a system  consisting of a mix of power 
plants of various sizes into which energy is fed from different sources presents new 
challenges to existing power transmission grids. The trend is moving away from 
unidirectional power transmission an d distribution from large power plants to the end -
consumer towards a system of complex electricity flows where end consumers are partly 
also acting as producers and feed into the public grid. This means in particular new 
challenges for grid stabilization.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  46  This process is supported by the displacement  of conventional large power plants, 
specifically those fueled by lignite and hard coal, and the shift to decentralized plants as 
well as the reduction of CO 2 emissions in the power generation and oil and gas in dustries 
based on the reorientation in the general public, in politics, corporate entities and investors 
who, in view of climate change and air pollution, demand the quickest possible reduction 
of harmful emissions.  
For the construction and maintenance of conventional power generation plants  this means in 
particular : 
 On the one hand, the number of new large coal and gas power plants needed is decreasing 
because additional demand for electricity is met primarily by wind energy and 
photovoltaics, whose electr icity production costs generally decrease. On the other hand, 
the requirements for new power plants are changing because they are often not needed to 
cover the base load but for peak balancing. In this regard, they are competing with storage 
solutions (mai nly batteries) where currently significant decreases in prices can be observed.  
 Furthermore, utilization rates of existing coal and gas power plants could decrease through 
the primary energy feed -in from renewable sources, thereby reducing required mainten ance 
for turbines, unless this effect is compensated by an increase in the start -ups and shut -
downs of the power plants that are actually designed for continuous operation.  
At the same time – despite a growing percentage of renewables – the large amount of  energy assets 
is only changing slowly. Given the volatility of renewable energies, conventional power plants will, 
for the time being, be needed to safeguard security of supply and in that context are able to supply 
an assured base load. This is why, in t he medium term, fossil energy sources  will remain core 
elements of the energy system and will require  further extraction in new areas as well.  
The extraction of fossil fuels in the oil and gas industry is also undergoing a transformation process 
towards a reduction of CO 2 emissions. In line with global climate protection targets and operator 
initiatives, the importance of gas is increasing compared to other fossil fuels (such as oil) due to its 
lower emissions. In addition, efficiency improvements in plant operation lead to cost reductions 
and a further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  
As for the field of power generation from renewable energies, generally speaking, further market 
growth is to be expected. The pressure to further increase commercial efficiency of generation 
facilities will continue. At the same time, the sales performanc e of facilities for generating power 
from renewable energies so far  depend s heavily on government regulation and state subsidization 
in the individual markets. Sudden changes in regulations or a phasing -out of subsidy schemes may 
have a briefly major impac t on the marketable number of new facilities. Currently, in many 
jurisdictions, a strong trend can be observed towards the use of auctions for renewable energy 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  47 capacities, away from for instance  guaranteed feed -in tariffs. The operators of plants for power  
generation from renewable energies will have to find new business models that enable profitability 
even without state subsidies and incentives.  
For the construction and operation of power transmission grids, the increasing shift towards energy 
supply base d on an increasing proportion of fluctuating renewable energy sources means that, in 
years to come, significant investments on the part of the energy grid providers will be necessary. 
At the same time, the producers of transmission and distribution grids w ill have to invest in research 
and development of new technologies.  
 The need for new transmission grids follows on the one hand from the fact that power is 
often generated at a great distance from the place where it is actually consumed and that, 
according ly, new transmission grids have to be established. As far as offshore wind power 
plants are concerned, this is due to their location on the high seas; in all other respects, the 
economic centers with a high energy demand are often not located in those regi ons or 
climates that enable optimal generation of energy using wind power or photovoltaics.  
 Moreover, the number of feed points into distribution grids significantly increases the grid 
complexity. Besides investments in equipment (e.g. transformers, high -performance 
electronics), digital technologies will play an important part in creating a balance between 
variable consumption and fluctuating production.  
 For the operation and maintenance of power plants and electricity grids, digitalization will 
become mor e and more important. By continuously monitoring and analyzing large 
quantities of data, downtimes can be minimized, operability optimized, and customized 
maintenance contracts concluded.  
At the same time, new business fields, especially in the field of lo ng-term storage of energy from 
renewable resources, may evolve. For example, using high -performance storage solutions, energy 
reserves could be built during the production -intensive summer months for use in low production 
winter months. Battery storage sol utions can be largely ignored due to the technical restrictions of 
long-term storage periods. Therefore hydrogen or Power -to-X technologies may take on a more 
important role  (using Power -to-X technologies, electricity from renewable energies can be used fo r 
the production of low -CO 2 synthetic energy sources (power fuels) and basic chemical materials ). 
Hydrogen, which can be generated ("greenly") without any emissions, will be used alongside  
energy storage also in industrial applications (such as in steel pr oduction or the chemical industry), 
if these are  also further decarbonized.  
The rapidly changing market environment described above requires constant decision -making on 
the strategic orientation of the Siemens Energy Business and on the distribution and allocation of 
capital for research, development and the establishment of new product lines and production sites. 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  48 As an autonomous and independent group, the Future Siemens Energy Group will be able to react 
on short -term market and industry trends in a more flexible, quicker and more resolute way.  
 Better Framework Conditions for Implementing Each Company's Own Strategy  
The legal separation of the Siemens Energy Business improves the framework conditions for both 
the Future Siemens Group and the Future Siemens Energy Group individually to implement their 
own strategy. Each enterprise may develop and pursue its own independent strat egy, diversify its 
respective business activities independently in terms of customers, technologies, risks and markets, 
and adjust necessary processes to the changing market conditions in an even more agile and more 
targeted manner.  
 The Future Siemens Grou p may further concentrate the Siemens Group portfolio on the 
business fields in the industrial, infrastructure, mobility solutions and healthcare sectors. 
The company seeks to thereby further expand its leading position in the growth markets of 
automation,  industrial digitization and intelligent infrastructure.  
 Siemens Energy AG, too, may pursue a strategy of its own. There will no longer be any 
need for coordination or even a competitive situation with the business fields of the Future 
Siemens Group regard ing capital allocation, acquisition strategy or investment budget. 
This increases corporate agility and facilitates implementing attractive investment 
opportunities, including the entering into partnerships or the potential acquisitions of 
companies.  
 Sieme ns Energy AG will be able to use its newly gained independence to more effectively 
react to the dynamics in the energy industry and the changing challenges of the energy 
market with simplified and more efficient decision -making  and reporting processes, 
independently of the requirements of the business remaining in the Future Siemens Group. 
This independence will allow Siemens Energy AG to focus exclusively on its own markets 
and address even more directly the needs of customers in a changing market environm ent 
and in line with the product cycles of the energy market. This will enable Siemens 
Energy  AG to secure and strengthen its position in the energy market with greater 
entrepreneurial freedom.  
 Avoiding Internal Competition for Financing Sources  
After the legal separation of the Future Siemens Energy Group, both groups will have their own 
access to the capital market. Efforts are being made that the Future Siemens Energy Group  will 
meet the qualification for a  rating  in the investment grade range . 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  49 The Future Siemens Group will be able to better allocate the capital available to it in accordance 
with the focused strategic orientation in order to strengthen and expand the Siemens Group's 
competitive position in the identified core activities.  
The Future S iemens Energy Group will independently procure financing via the capital market and 
will be able to decide about using the financing without taking into account the additional approval 
requirements that must otherwise be taken into account in a broad -based  corporate group such as 
the present Siemens Group. As part of the Siemens Group, the Siemens Energy Business has only 
very limited possibilities to obtain external capital independently and require s the allocation of 
funding within the corporate group. Th is allocation depends on a large number of factors, such as 
growth, profitability, the potential for synergies with other activities of the Siemens Group and the 
strategic importance of the financed part of the corporate group for the entire Siemens Group.  
 Better Transparency and Strengthening  of Internal and External Identity  
The Future Siemens Group and the Future Siemens Energy Group will each be able to establish a 
more focused profile.  
Its own regular reporting and investor relations work that a listin g entails will allow Siemens 
Energy AG to better define its corporate profile and its perception in the greater public and present 
Siemens Energy AG's position in the market in a transparent and detailed manner during this 
important phase of change in the global energy markets.  
Moreover, a listing allows for the introduction of stock -based compensation programs and 
employee participation programs, which will be directly linked to Siemens Energy AG's business 
success. Thus, Siemens Energy AG can foster emplo yee participation in the business and broaden 
its options for keeping and attracting further highly qualified personnel.  
 Freedom of Decision for Shareholders and Conglomerate Discount  
The focus on the identified core fields of business strengthens the investment and risk profile for 
the Siemens Share and the Siemens Energy Share. Because both future groups pursue  their 
strategies independently, the former Siemens Shareholders will be ab le to decide freely and 
separately on their participation s in both companies, Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG, with 
their clearly defined separate investment and risk profiles. Depending on their own risk preferences 
and investment strategies, they will b e able to invest specificall y in one or both of the future groups  
in the future . The new correlation between opportunities and risks of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group could also attract new investors that thus far have not held Siemens Shares.  
In the opin ion of Siemens AG's managing board, the legal separation of the Siemens Energy 
Business offers the advantage that the current conglomerate discount on the Siemens Share could 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  50 decrease. The reason for this is that Siemens AG is perceived on the capital mark et as a 
conglomerate because of the different markets it serves and the diversified risk profiles  of 
individual business areas  resulting from that. Pure players, i.e., companies that, in contrast, only 
operate in a more strongly focused business area, have  been favored for some time now by the 
capital market from a transparency, efficiency and portfolio perspective. This means that the shares 
of companies serving various  very diverse  business areas – such as Siemens AG – in the opinion 
of Siemens AG's manag ing board are traded on the stock exchange at a conglomerate discount. 
Siemens AG's managing board is confident that a possible conglomerate discount on the Siemens 
Share will be at least reduced following the legal separation of the Siemens Energy Busines s.  
 Disadvantages and Risks  
The legal separation of the Siemens Energy Business also entails disadvantages and risks for 
Siemens AG, Siemens Energy AG and their respective shareholders.  
 The legal separation of the Siemens Energy Business reduces the degree of diversification, 
and individual risk positions may carry proportionally  greater weight after the legal 
separation. While the risk profiles of business areas of the Future Siemens Gro up and of 
the Future Siemens Energy Group differ and thus reduced the overall risk through 
diversification, the risk profiles of the two independent groups will have to be evaluated 
separately in the future. The respective risk profiles can develop negativ ely in particular if 
both the industrial market concerned and the capital market come under pressure 
simultaneously. The focused business model of the Future Siemens Energy Group after the 
Spin-off taking  effect may, in the perception of the capital market s, be more susceptible to 
negative developments in the markets of the energy business, for example, if they result 
from customers' refinancing difficulties on the financial and capital markets. In the view 
of Siemens AG's managing board, the changed risk p rofile of both groups is a necessary 
effect of the creation of two more strongly focused groups that needs to  be accepted. From 
an investor perspective, this effect can be reduced or eliminated  independently  by 
diversification effects from a sufficiently l arge portfolio. Significant risks for the two 
companies or their shareholders could arise if both companies were lacking solid 
capitalization and funding. The managing board of Siemens AG and the managing board 
of Siemens Energy AG believe that, after impl ementation of the Spin -off in the manner 
specifically set out, the Future Siemens Energy Group  will be solidly capitalized and will 
have a solid funding base ; in the opinion of Siemens AG's managing board, this also applies 
to the Future Siemens Group . 
 Moreover, there is the risk that synergies and economies of scale will be diminished or 
eliminated. With the Future Siemens Energy Group becoming legally separate, current 
synergy effects and economies of scale may be partially lost in certain areas, specific ally 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  51 in the support and service units that until now have been used jointly, for instance in 
procurement, which may also result in increased internal and external current  costs. As 
regards the IT  environment, particularly for Siemens Energy AG, along with its 
infrastructure, systems, applications and the associated support and development functions, 
additional costs will also arise, at least in the short term. The managing boards of Siemens 
AG and Siemens Energy AG are convinced, however, that the positive effects anticipated 
from the division into two smaller, more dynamic and more focused companies will 
outweigh the loss in synergies and economies of scale. Moreover, in areas such as 
procurement , it will also be possible – though under more stringent requi rements – for the 
Future Siemens Group and the Future Siemens Energy Group to cooperate.  
 Since Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG will continue to use the same umbrella brand  
"Siemens ", a mutual reputation al risk arises, even though the graphic design of the 
"Energy" element in the "Siemens Energy" brand will elicit a certain differentiation. For 
more details on the advantages and disadvantages of the Siemens Energy Business using 
the "Siemens" brand, see in detail Chapter  III.2.d).  
 Moreover, there is the risk that the advantages anticipated from the Spin -off will be realized 
only in part or later than expected. Possible reasons for this include, among others, the 
necessity for each company to establish separa te functions and processes, including a new 
IT environment for the Future Siemens Energy Group. This will result in increased costs 
for the separate Future Siemens Energy Group, at least in the short term. In addition, a 
greater vulnerability to market flu ctuations, an at least initial reluctance of customers, the 
loss of business opportunities and less appreciation on the labor market for the Future 
Siemens Energy Group as a new partner might have an adverse effect on the operations of 
the Future Siemens E nergy Group. The legal separation of the Siemens Energy Business 
will also be implemented within a very short period of time considering the complexity of 
the process. It cannot be ruled out that individual functions and processes of the Future 
Siemens Ene rgy Group will not be fully functional at the time the Spin -off takes effect. 
The managing boards of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG believe, however, that the 
aforementioned risks can be minimized through thorough preparation and planning of the 
function s and processes and through open communication with external partners such that 
the risks will no longer be significant as compared to the advantages of a legal separation.  
 A further potential disadvantage of the legal separation of the Siemens Energy Business is 
that, due to the financial separation of the Siemens Energy Business and its departure from 
the Siemens Group, the Future Siemens Energy Group could face difficultie s in meeting 
certain financing and capital requirements and in fulfilling certain services and functions 
that in the past were performed by the Siemens Group in an independent structure, for 
instance, by the Future Siemens Energy Group discharging the fina ncing heretofore drawn 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  52 via the Siemens Group and refinancing itself externally, possibly even at less favorable 
conditions. Less favorable refinancing conditions will also arise from, inter alia,  a rating 
of the Future Siemens Energy Group inferior to that  of the Siemens Group because of an 
overall lower debt sustainability. The same applies to securities  that thus far had been 
provided by Siemens AG and individual Future Siemens Group Companies to third parties 
on behalf of the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies directly and indirectly via banks 
and insurances. Upon the Spin -off taking effect, these will in principle have to be replaced 
by security provided (directly or indirectly) by the Future Siemens Energy Group  as well . 
Business partners of the Futu re Siemens Energy Group might also more firmly insist on 
the provision of bank guarantees instead  of group guarantees. Because of individual ESG 
principles (environmental, social and governance), banks might act more restrictively in 
providing their guaran tees depending on the project. Financial performance is also a 
criterion in connection with plant construction and maintenance contracts and their terms. 
The Future Siemens Energy Group will have to obtain guarantees and security required for 
its operative  business, in particular, on its own and independently of the Future Siemens 
Group. Furthermore, n o later than the Spin -off taking effect, the hedging transactions on 
currency, interest rates and commodity pricing entered into by the individual Future 
Siem ens Energy Group Companies with the Future Siemens Group are also to be 
terminated  or novated (see Chapter  V.3.c)) . Less favorable terms and conditions may be 
achieved by the Future Siemens Energy Group for the new hedging transactions on 
currency, interes t rates and commodity pricing to be entered into with the banks. The 
managing board of Siemens AG and the managing board of Siemens Energy AG believe 
that, due to the solid capital structure of the Future Siemens Energy Group, an independent 
financing will be achieved.  
 If repayment of existing guarantees and security issued or provided (directly or indirectly) 
by Siemens AG and the Future Siemens Group is not successful, the Future Siemens Group 
faces the risk that it will continue to be liable for obligati ons of the Siemens Energy 
Business for many years to come until such guarantees and security expire. However, in 
the internal relationship, indemnification has been provided for the benefit of  the Future 
Siemens Group.  
 In addition to the possibly increased  running costs mentioned above, one -time costs will 
also be incurred in connection with the legal separation of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group (for more detail, cf. Chapter  V.14 and Chapter  VI.17). The costs of the legal 
separation basically comprise the costs for establishing two separate groups, including 
costs for the division and establishment of IT systems and applications as well as tax 
burdens. The costs caused by the Spin -off relate primarily to costs for external consulting 
(e.g. by investment ban ks and lawyers) , audit costs (auditors), notarization costs, costs of 
shareholders' meetings, costs for the filings with the registers of companies and the costs 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  53 of the planned admission to stock exchange trading (" Transaction Costs "). The managing 
boards of Siemens AG and of Siemens Energy AG are of the opinion that the previously 
mentioned  advantages of the legal separation will outweigh the costs and tax burden caused 
thereby.  
2. Rationale for the Specific Structure of the Future Siemens Group and of the Fu ture 
Siemens Energy Group and for the Use of the Brand  
When selecting the business areas to be separated, Siemens AG's managing board has been guided 
by the concept that the Future Siemens Group will focus more strongly on its core competencies. 
Therefore,  those business areas that are connected to the energy sector were to be combined in a 
separate group under Siemens Energy AG, while the Future Siemens Group will concentrate on the 
business areas primarily in the fields of digital industries and smart infrastructure , supplemented 
by mobility and healthcare. At the same time, the Future Siemens Energy Group should receive all 
major business activities  and fields that are necessary for the further development of its business in 
the energy sector.  
 General All ocation of Business Activities  
Accordingly, the operating business Gas and Power – as it has generally been reported since 
1 April  2019 and as it existed at the time of the decision to separate the Siemens Energy Business 
in May  2019 – has formed the basis for determining the business activities  to be transferred.  
It was further decided that the majority participation in SGRE S.A. would  belong to the Future 
Siemens Energy Group because, as a provider of comprehensive solutions in the energy sector, 
Siemens Energy AG (as a "pure -play" energy company) shall be positioned with a comprehensive 
performance commitment in both the conventional and renewable energies sectors. Wind energy 
plays an important role in mastering the global energy transition and is therefore a significant 
component in completing the energy value chain from fossil to renewabl e energies and forward -
looking technologies such as hydrogen or synthetic fuels. For the business areas remaining with 
Siemens AG, the participation in SGRE S.A. would not have the same strategic value, and would 
generally even conflict with the further co ncentration of the Future Siemens Group.  
 Allocation of Further Business Activities to the Siemens Energy Business  
Based on the aforesaid general allocations to the Siemens Energy Business on the one hand and the 
business remaining with the Future Siemens G roup on the other, adjustments were made to the 
portfolio structure in order to position both future groups optimally in view of their respective 
needs:  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  54  The hydrogen solutions business was allocated to the Siemens Energy Business. Hydrogen 
is a potential f uture substitute for fossil hydrocarbons as an energy carrier. This is a rapidly 
developing business for the production of hydrogen and carbon monoxide for application 
in fuels and chemical energy carriers. Hydrogen solutions offers important, highly 
innov ative solutions for the future energy portfolio of the Siemens Energy Business, which 
covers the Power -to-X value chain by its own value creation and collaborations with 
partners. The hydrogen solutions operations were originally part of the central operat ing 
unit Corporate Technology. With a view to the future Power -to-X technologies for the 
energy sector, this is, however, a business that is strategically better placed in the Future 
Siemens Energy Group than in the Future Siemens Group.  
 The Distribution T ransformers operations (" DT") have also been allocated to the Siemens 
Energy Business. This business was formerly reported by Smart Infrastructure. The 
distribution transformers manufactured by DT are needed both in switchgear facilities of 
Smart Infrastru cture and in Gas and Power's distribution grid business. Nine out of 13 
facilities where distribution transformers are manufactured have been used jointly by Smart 
Infrastructure and the operating company Gas and Power as reported in  the fiscal year 2019. 
If DT had remained in Smart Infrastructure, the facilities would have had to be legally 
separated. This would have caused DT and Siemens Energy Business to be less 
competitive. Another argument for the allocation of DT to the Siemens Energy Business 
was th at development synergies could be secured in this way: Technological innovations 
in the field of transformers are often first developed for power transformers that are part of 
the original Siemens Energy Business, and are thereafter implemented for distrib ution 
transformers.  
 Finally, the Siemens Energy Business was enhanced by the solutions business for oil & 
gas, previously reported in the Portfolio Companies . The Future Siemens Energy Group 
thereby gains better control over the distribution channel for oil & gas products to the extent 
that these are sold via the solutions business for oil & gas, and avoids potential competition 
in the fringe areas of the resp ective portfolios. The subsea business was also transferred in 
this context.  
 The interests in Ethos Energy Group Limited and Voith Hydro Holding GmbH & Co. KG, 
both previously reported in the Portfolio Companies , have also been allocated to the 
Siemens Ene rgy Business.  With its portfolio of components for various hydro -electric 
power plants as well as the adjoining service business, the joint venture Voith Hydro 
Holding GmbH & Co. KG is active in the area of energy generation and as such 
complements the act ivities of the Future Siemens Energy Group.  The Voith Hydro Holding 
GmbH & Co. KG joint venture provides for a world wide infinite non -competition 
obligation in the field of electricity generation by way of hydropower . The Ethos Energy 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  55 Group Limited joint v enture sources a number of services from the business activities  of 
the Siemens Energy Business, and it uses intellectual property and tool licenses for its 
business which belong to the Siemens Energy Business. Moreover, significant overlaps of 
the supply chains of Ethos Energy Group Limited and the Siemens Energy Business exist, 
which  ultimately  also gave an argument for allocating the joint venture to the Siemens 
Energy Business.  
 Activities not allocated to the Siemens Energy Business  
Due to legal restric tions or based on commercial considerations, certain business activities of the 
operating company Gas and Power, as reported in  the fiscal year 2019, located for the most part in 
non-European jurisdictions have not been or have not fully been transferred directly or indirectly 
to Siemens Energy KG:  
 Siemens Ltd., Mumbai/ India  
With the exception of an entity  in India, which had originally been part of the Dresser Rand business 
taken over by the Siemens Group, the Indian Gas and Power business was not separated:  
 Like the major part of Siemens Group's other business in India, the local Gas and Power 
business i n India ( most notably  in the Digital Industries and Smart Infrastructure divisions) 
is mainly  operated via Siemens Ltd., Mumbai/India (" Siemens Ltd., India "). Siemens 
Ltd.,  India , is a local listed company in which the Siemens Group holds a participation o f 
just slightly below 75  % of the shares. Based on a so -called agency agreement, Siemens 
Ltd., India , acts as exclusive agent for the Siemens Group in India and also as reseller, 
contract developer and contract manufacturer. In  the fiscal year ending on 
30 September  2019, Siemens Ltd., India , generated revenues with the local Gas and Power 
business of approximately EUR  538 million  and an EBITA of approximately EUR  81 
million . 
 A separation of the Indian Gas and Power business from publicly traded Siemens Ltd., 
India , would have led to significant financing being required for the acquisition of the local 
Gas and Power business from the Indian company, associated with  high tax charges. 
Instead, the Future Siemens Energy Group will acquire a minority particip ation in Siemens 
Ltd., India , in the form of  a 24 % shareholding , and the Future Siemens Group will retain 
a majority participation of approximately 51  % of the shares. The Future Siemens Group 
will continue to exercise operational control over Siemens Ltd ., India. However, the Future 
Siemens Energy Group will, through its participation in Siemens Ltd., India, also 
participate in the profits of the Indian business via distributions; in this regard, its profit 
participation (equivalent to 24  %) will not be l imited to the Indian Gas and Power business, 
but will also include the other activities of Siemens Ltd., India.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  56  Siemens AG and Siemens Ltd., India , have already entered into an exclusive agency 
agreement that designates Siemens Ltd., India, as exclusive ag ent of the Siemens product 
portfolio for India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives. The Future Siemens Energy 
Group will continue this relationship  with regard to the Siemens Gas and Power Business 
for which  a corresponding agency agreement between the Siemens Energy KG and 
Siemens Ltd., India  has been concluded.  
 In addition, Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG have concluded a shareholders' 
agreement with regard to Siemens Ltd., India. Under this agreement, the Future Siemens 
Group and the Future Sieme ns Energy Group will coordinate their actions with respect to 
the exercise of their shareholder rights, while Siemens AG will retain management and 
control of all major decisions. In this framework, Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG 
have also agreed that Fu ture Siemens Energy Group will enter into a minimum purchase 
commitment vis-à-vis Siemens Ltd, India , with respect to certain products and services of 
Siemens Ltd, India. In the event of a termination of the shareholders' agreement, an 
obligation exists to  separate the Indian Gas and Power business from Siemens Ltd., India , 
and to unbundle the business activities in India between the Future Siemens Energy Group 
and the Future Siemens Group.  
 Agency Countries without Corporate Participation of the Future Siem ens Energy 
Group  
In several countries,  the local Gas and Power business was not transferred to separate legal entities 
for various reasons. Instead, the Future Siemens Group Companies, in addition to their other 
business es, continue to operate the local Gas and Power business on their own account on the basis 
of a so-called agency and distributorship agreement. Only in the event of a termination of the 
agency and distributorship agreement, it is intended that the Future Siemens Energy Group will 
have to a cquire the respective local Gas and Power business from the respective local Future 
Siemens Group Company at fair market value. In detail, this applies to the following countries:  
 In Indonesia, for the time being, no transfer of the local Gas and Power bus iness (revenue 
of approximately EUR  148 million  in the fiscal year 2019) to a new legal entity was 
implemented because a local  business  license would be required as a prerequisite and 
currently such a license would only be available if a local minority sha reholder with a 
capital share of at least 33  % was admitted to the new entity.  
 Likewise, in Algeria, no legal separation (revenue of the local Gas and Power business in  
the fiscal year 2019: approximately EUR  52 million ) was implemented because, as a 
prere quisite, a local majority shareholder would have to be admitted to the new legal entity.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  57  In Pakistan (revenue of the local Gas and Power business in Pakistan in the fiscal year 
2019: approximately EUR  53 million ), a transfer of the local Gas and Power busi ness to a 
new non -listed legal entity would have triggered prohibitive taxation of the project business 
in that country so that, for the time being, it was decided to abstain from a separation.  
 In Greece (revenue of the local Gas and Power business in Gree ce in  the fiscal year 2019: 
approximately EUR  13 million ), no legal separation was implemented, as the expected 
business volume does not justify a separate company.  
 Further Countries without Carve -out 
In several countries, the costs of establishing indepen dent local companies for the Siemens Gas and 
Power Business would, in view of the minimal economic significance of the local Gas and Power 
business  and the expected costs , be disproportionate in terms of the economic effect . This applies 
to Costa Rica, Tun isia, Guatemala and El Salvador. Instead, distribution in these countries will be 
done via contractual agreements with local companies of the Future Siemens Group and the local 
Siemens Energy Business will be liquidated. The projects still in progress are being completed by 
the companies of the Future Siemens Group acc ording to schedule. The future contract s with 
customers will then be concluded  by other entities of the Future Siemens Energy Group outside 
these countries.  
 Use of the "Siemens" Brand  
The managing board of Siemens AG and the managing board of Siemens Energy AG are in 
agreement that it is advantageous in particular for the conduct and further development of the 
Siemens Energy Business if the Siemens Gas and Power Business continues to be  conducted under 
the name and brand "Siemens Energy" and if the SGRE Business continues to be conducted under 
the "Siemens Gamesa" name and brand. As an alternative to continuing the "Siemens" name and 
brand with the added element "Energy" and "Gamesa," re spectively, it was considered to create an 
independent, new name and brand for the Siemens Energy Business without using the "Siemens" 
name. The following considerations ultimately led to the decision to continue operating the Siemens 
Energy Business under  the "Siemens Energy" and "Siemens Gamesa" names and brands:  
 Having been used for many years and built and developed with continuous effort by the 
Siemens Group, the "Siemens" name and brand have gained an exceptionally high 
immaterial value that is also r eflected in their quality as a considerable asset. The 
"Siemens" name and brand are associated with such attributes as quality, value, uniqueness, 
innovative strength, technological excellence, trust, reliability and integrity. They are 
linked with the exc ellent products and the exceptional know -how of the Siemens Group. 
This acquired renown and this value can continue to be used by the Future Siemens Energy 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  58 Group in its intended use of the "Siemens Energy" and "Siemens Gamesa" names and 
brands.  
 The "Siemen s" name and brand are already very well established in the energy sector and 
"Siemens Energy" gives a clear indication of the company's sphere of activity.  
 The "Siemens Energy" name and brand were examined in a special process with regard to 
availability, cultural acceptance, differentiation from the competition and linguistic 
connotation. The results were positive regarding every aspect. The continued use of the 
"Siemens" component also met customer expectations, which were also evaluated. The 
name and bra nd "Siemens Energy" and "Siemens Gamesa" therefore purposefully form a 
fundamental component of the Siemens Energy Business' strategy.  
 The ecosystem of the brands "Siemens", "Siemens Healthineers", "Siemens Energy" and 
"Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy" is based on a strong mutual understanding of the 
brands within the group of users, which is repeatedly monitored and adjusted by so -called 
"branding committees". This ensures the protection, maintenance and refinement of the 
heart of the "Siemens" brand.  
 The managing board of Siemens AG is confident that the expanded use of the "Siemens" 
name and brand not only entails an increase in brand awareness, but also a simultaneous 
increase in their market value.  
The use of the "Siemens Energy" and "Siemens Gamesa" names and brands is provided for in brand 
licensing agreements that Siemens AG has entered into with Siemens Energy KG and SGRE. The 
details of these agreements are presented in Chapters  XI.3.a) and XI.3.b).  
In its considerations to allow the Siemens Energ y Business to be conducted under the "Siemens 
Energy" and "Siemens Gamesa" names and brands, the managing board of Siemens AG and the 
management of the Siemens Energy Business also took pertinent disadvantages into account. In 
particular, the individual ob ligations assumed in the brand licensing agreements as well as 
termination and other rights of the relevant other contractual party may be disadvantageous. The 
brand licensing agreements do not grant exclusivity in favor of the Future Siemens Energy Group;  
even within the defined scope of the license, a potential competitive situation may arise therefore 
in the future between the Future Siemens Group and the Future Siemens Energy Group under the 
same umbrella brand. At the same time, reciprocal reputational  risks caused by the use of the same 
umbrella brand cannot be ruled out. In particular, it cannot be ruled out that, after the Spin -off takes 
effect and Siemens AG loses control over the Siemens Energy Business, Siemens AG will also be 
associated with the commercial activities, individual orders or individual occurrences at companies 
of the Future Siemens Energy Group that will be criticized by the public in light of decarbonization 
and ESG efforts (environmental, social and governance).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  59 In conclusion, howe ver, the managing board of Siemens AG and the managing board of Siemens 
Energy AG expect the strength of the "Siemens" name and brand and the advantages of the Future 
Siemens Energy Group using the "Siemens Energy" and "Siemens Gamesa" names and brands to 
outweigh the associated potential disadvantages.  
3. Reasons for the Spin -off Decision  
After a careful examination, the managing board of Siemens AG resolved, with the approval of the 
supervisory board, to carry out a spin -off under the UmwG. The managing boar d of Siemens AG 
has thoroughly reviewed and carefully considered each of the options available for implementing 
the legal separation of the Siemens Energy Business. Aside from a spin -off under the UmwG, a 
legal separation of the Siemens  Energy Business cou ld also be implemented by a sale of a business 
segment by way of a public offer of shares (an Initial Public Offering (" IPO")) or an M&A 
transaction. A distribution of a dividend in kind to the Siemens Shareholders could also be 
considered.  
 Reasons for the  Spin -off 
In the view of the managing board of Siemens AG, compared to alternative transactions, the Spin -
off is in the best interest of Siemens AG and its shareholders. Especially the following reasons are 
decisive for this:  
 The successful implementation of the Spin -off does not depend to the same degree on a 
positive environment in the capital market as it would have been the case with a public 
offering of the shares by way of an IPO; it therefore provides a high degree of transaction 
certainty. Assuming the approval of the shareholders' meeting of Siemens AG, the listing 
of Siemens Energy AG in the context of the Spin -off will follow a clearly defined path that 
gives both Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG a reliable basis for planning.  
 In a spin -off, the s hare in Siemens Energy AG to be held by Siemens AG can be reliably 
and exactly determined in advance. In the case of an IPO, the number of the Siemens 
Energy Shares (indirectly) remaining with Siemens AG would depend on how the market 
will accept the share s at the relevant time. With a spin -off and the conclusion of a 
deconsolidation  agreement, certainty regarding the future shareholding structure and the 
management of the Future Siemens Energy Group can be achieved at an early stage. 
Uncertainties as to a continuing control of Siemens Energy AG by Siemens AG and the 
full consolidation of the Siemens Energy Business in the consolidated financial statements 
of Siemens AG are avoided. The Spin -off secures the intended purpose of giving up the 
entrepreneurial l eadership of Siemens Energy Business by Siemens AG.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  60  In the case of a spin -off, any necessary discount on the value of the Siemens Energy Shares 
for the placement under an IPO can be avoided which will directly be to the benefit  of the 
Siemens Shareholders.  In order to be able to place 55  % of the shares of Siemens Energy 
AG in the case of an IPO with sufficient certainty, presumably a significant discount on 
the value of the shares would become necessary because, otherwise, investors would not 
be prepared t o subscribe shares given a generally volatile capital market environment. In 
the event of a subsequent recovery, only the newly investing shareholders would have 
profited from such a discount, at the expense of the  existing Siemens Shareholders. In the 
case of a spin -off, however, the Siemens Shareholders may decide for themselves whether  
they wish to realize the value of Siemens Energy AG reflected on the stock exchange.  
 Under a spin -off scenario , the new Siemens Energy Shares will be directly distributed to 
the Siemens  Shareholders . This gives Siemens Shareholders the possibility to decide 
separately on their participations in both companies with their respective clearly defined 
investment profiles ( cf. Chapter  III.1.e) above).  
Disadvantages are also inher ent for Siemens AG under the Spin -off which have been taken into 
account when making the decision in favor of the Spin -off. 
 Contrary to an IPO or a non -public sale of Siemens Energy AG to investors, Siemens AG 
will not realize any direct liquid funds under  the Spin -off in the form of proceeds from the 
sale or placement.  
 The Spin -off constitutes a payout  of equity by the transferring entity to its shareholders. 
Therefore, the Spin-off will result in a direct reduction in Siemens AG's equity under the 
German Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch , "HGB ") in the amount of the book value 
of the spun -off participation, and in a reduction of the dividend reserve. Similarly, the 
equity reported in the consolidated statements of financial position of Siemens AG under 
International Financial Reporting Standards (" IFRS ") will also be lower.  
 Once the Spin -off and the resulting deconsolidation of the Future Siemens Energy Group 
(by Siemens AG waiving a controlling influence in the Future Siemens Energy Group , 
ensured by a deconsolidation agreement ) take effect, the remaining participation in 
Siemens Energy AG will be reported in the consolidated statements of financial position 
of Siemens AG as a participation accounted for using the equity method . The initial 
valuation will be the  fair value ( beizulegender Zeitwert ) of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group  in accordance with IFRS . This fair value is not yet known so that for the purposes 
of this Spin -off Report the pro rata  book value of the disposal  group (Abgangsgruppe ) is 
used. If, at the time the Spin -off becomes effective, the fair value were  below the pro rata  
book value of the disposal group, this would lead to a lower disposal result 
(Abgangsergebnis ) in the consolidated financial statements  of Siemens AG. The remai ning 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  61 shareholding  in Siemens  Energy  AG is subject to risks in terms of change in value , i.e., a 
decline of the  fair value below the carrying amount of the interest ( Beteiligungsansatz ) 
would lead to  an impairment in the consolidated financial statements of  Siemens AG. In 
this regard, there may be a further significant reduction of the consolidated equity (more 
detailed information on the accounting effects of the Spin -off are set out in  in detail  
Chapter  VIII.1). There are also tax disadvantages in the Spin -off, primarily involving the 
loss of a portion of the losses that can be set off and remaining tax loss carryforwards of 
Siemens AG that are not available for crediting against profits (cf., in this regard, 
Chapter  VIII.2).  
 Furthermore, the structure of t he entire transaction in a spin -off under the UmwG and the 
other measures discussed in this Report are in part more complex than would have been 
the case if other approaches to the transaction, for example an IPO, had been chosen. This 
relates primarily to  the target structure and the steps necessary to achieve the structure, 
such as to ensure the number of shares entitled for allocation ( cf. Chapter  VI.13.a)), the 
approval of Siemens AG's shareholders' meeting required under the UmwG, the 
preparation of a spin -off report, the examinations by court appointed auditors required for 
implementation (on this point, cf. Chapter  VI.8) and the adjustment of stock -based 
compensation programs and employee participation programs (on this point, cf. 
Chapter  XIII.1. k)). 
 It can also be assumed that in the case of a spin -off under which all Siemens Shareholders 
receive shares in Siemens Energy AG, a not insignificant part of investors (for example 
particular index funds) will sell the shares allocated to them. This can  influence the stock 
exchange price of Siemens Energy Shares.  
 Furthermore, under the provisions of the UmwG, Siemens Energy AG is jointly and 
severally liable for the satisfaction of all liabilities established prior to the Spin -off taking 
effect by Siemen s AG as the transferring entity. In specific circumstances, transformation 
law entitles creditors to require  securities from Siemens AG or Siemens Energy AG. In 
this context,  it is necessary, among other things, to provide prima facie  evidence that the 
fulfilment of the claim is prejudiced by the Spin -off. In the opinion of the managing boards 
of Siemens AG and of Siemens Energy AG, the requirements for a security will not be 
fulfilled upon completion of the Spin -off due to the capital and financial resourc es 
available to both companies.  
 Furthermore, as a result of the Spin -off and the creation of two independent listed 
companies, the costs for administration and the costs for corporate bodies will increase. 
Finally, the Spin -off will give rise to Transacti on Costs and taxes (for further detail, cf. 
Chapter  VI.17 below).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  62 In the view of the managing board of Siemens AG, however, these disadvantages of the Spin -off 
do not support any different decision. The managing board of Siemens AG is instead convinced 
that the previously described benefits of the Spin -off by far outweigh the disadvantages caused.  
 Reasons against an IPO  
The managing board of Siemens AG has carefully examined a sale of the Siemens Energy Business 
by way of an IPO as an alternative to the Spi n-off. In the view of the managing board, such a 
transaction cannot be implemented currently, or in the foreseeable future, in a manner which lies 
in the interest of Siemens AG and its shareholders, especially due to the following reasons:  
 In the opinion of Siemens AG's managing board, an argument against an IPO of Siemens 
Energy AG by way of a public offer of the Siemens Energy AG shares is that, from today's 
perspective, an IPO does not provide the necessary transaction certainty given the current 
and an ticipated capital market environment over the short term. It would not be possible to 
predict with certainty whether a public offer of the shares would be possible in the context 
of an IPO at all or in the amount required for the intended purposes, and, in  particular, 
whether there would be sufficient demand for the issued shares at an acceptable price. 
Therefore, in case of an IPO, there is the risk that this cannot be implemented during the 
desired time period on attractive terms.  
 In the case of an IPO, t he determination of a clearly defined share of Siemens AG after the 
transaction would not be possible in the same degree, as it is not possible to assess the 
recepti veness of the market for the intended placement volume.  
 Although Siemens AG would have real ized proceeds from a sale in the case of an IPO, 
Siemens AG does not require proceeds of this kind in light of the currently very solid 
liquidity at Siemens AG and instead can allow the value of the Siemens Energy Business 
to directly benefit the Siemens S hareholders.  
 Under an IPO, it would not be possible to split up the Siemens Group fully and in a timely 
manner to the same extent as under a spin -off pursuant to the UmwG. In the case of an 
IPO, it is usually only possible to place a minority participation  at an appropriate price. If 
a larger block of shares is placed, price discounts cannot be ruled out. Any remaining 
participation of Siemens AG could only have been reduced in the course of further 
offerings with due regard to the market and only in the me dium term. The advantages 
envisaged by the Spin -off could not have been achieved in a timely manner and in the same 
way as in the case of the Spin -off. 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  63 
 Reasons against an M&A Transaction  
The managing board of Siemens AG examined the possibility of a comple te or partial divestment 
of the Siemens Energy Business by way of a company sale (" M&A  Transaction ") and decided 
against it after careful examination.  
In the view of the managing board of Siemens AG, the goals pursued by separating the Siemens 
Energy Busin ess could not have been achieved to the same degree under an M&A Transaction. 
Whereas, i n the view of the managing board of Siemens AG and the managing board of Siemens 
Energy AG, this separation by way of a spin -off corresponds best to the future focus of  the Siemens 
Energy Business and the responsibility owed to the Siemens Energy Business. In the case of a 
partial sale of the Siemens Energy Business, the goals of transferring the entire entrepreneurial 
responsibility for the Siemens Energy Business from Siemens AG to Siemens Energy AG , which 
are being pursued by the legal separation , could not have been achieved. Finally, a sale to a strategic 
investor, at least  if the investor comes from the classic energy business, would likely have to 
overcome substant ial hurdles under antitrust law due to the necessary size of such an investor and 
the concentration in the energy market.  
 Reasons against Issuing the Siemens Energy Shares in the Form of a Dividend in 
Kind  
Siemens AG's managing board also decided against a  legal separation from the Siemens Energy 
Business by way of a distribution as a dividend in kind. The issuance of Siemens Energy Shares in 
the form of a dividend in kind would not have had any material benefits compared to a Spin -off in 
the planned struct ure. However, there would have been both serious reasons under corporate law 
as well as disadvantages under tax law compared to the Spin -off: 
 Initially, a dividend in kind would not have been an appropriate alternative under tax 
aspects because the shareho lders of Siemens AG would have had to pay tax on this 
dividend in kind, just as it is the case with any other dividend. As consequence, especially 
German small -scale shareholders would not have the option, contrary to the situation under 
the Spin -off, to s ubstitute the received shares for the previously held shares on a pro rata 
basis for tax purposes subject to certain preconditions (see on this point, the description in 
Chapter  VIII.2.d)bb)(2)).  
 A transaction certainty comparable to that in a spin -off would also not have existed 
because, unlike in a spin -off, German stock corporation law does not provide for the 
possibility for a clearance procedure in the case of complaints against the resolution of the 
shareholders' meeting on the distribution in kind . Even an unfounded action to set aside the 
resolution about the distribution in kind initiated by a shareholder holding only one share 
could delay the measure becoming effective for years.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  64 4. Decision in Favor of the Remaining Participation in Siemens Energy  AG as non-controlling  
Anchor Shareholder  
Siemens AG intends to not completely separate itself from the Siemens Energy Business in 
connection with the Spin -off. Siemens  AG will initially remain a non -controlling anchor 
shareholder in Siemens Energy  AG with  a 35.1  % shareholding directly and indirectly via 
SBI GmbH. Additionally, the SPT e.V. will hold a 9.9  % stake in Siemens Energy  AG. In addition 
to a portion of the participation of Siemens AG in SBI GmbH, the direct participation of SBI GmbH 
in Siemens E nergy AG is also subject to a seven -year blocking period under tax law, i.e., it could 
be sold only subject to presumably major income taxes being triggered in this respect. With the 
strategic and operational development of Siemens Energy  AG and Siemens  AG, Siemens  AG 
intends to reduce its stake in Siemens Energy  AG significantly in a timeframe of twelve to 18 
months after the Spin -off taking effect.  
Siemens AG does not intend to exert controlling influence o ver Siemens Energy AG either by a 
majority of the  votes in the shareholders' meeting or in any other way. In order to ensure this, 
Siemens AG, Siemens  Energy AG and SBI GmbH additionally entered into a deconsolidation  
agreement on restricting the exercise of the voting rights by Siemens AG and SBI GmbH a t the 
shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG, which is described in more detail in Chapter  XIII.3. 
below. Upon the Spin -off taking effect, the direct and indirect participation of Siemens  AG in 
Siemens Energy AG will not be fully consolidated but will be included at equity  in the consolidated 
financial statements of the Future Siemens Group (see in this regard Chapter  VIII.1.d)bb)) below).  
The set amount of the portion of 35.1  % of the capital stock in Siemens Energy AG remaining with 
Siemens AG directly and indirectly via SBI GmbH (after transfer of a share of 9.9  % to SPT e.V.) 
in combination with the Deconsolidation  Agreement is a clear s ignal to the effect that Siemens 
Energy AG, as a listed company, will in the future act separately and independently of Siemens AG 
and that Siemens  AG does not claim any entrepreneurial leadership.  
This is, at the same time, a sign of confidence placed in the potential and the future development 
of Siemens Energy AG  and enables a participation in a possible value increase . Siemens AG 
directly and indirectly retains a participation in the equity that enables it to assume the position of 
a stable, non-control ling anchor shareholder for Siemens Energy AG, and that also reflects the 
significant interconn ection  remaining between the two companies, in particular in view of 
remaining guarantees ( cf. Chapter  V.3.d) ) and the joint umbrella brand.  
On the other hand, t he portion of 55  % of the shares in Siemens Energy AG issued to the 
shareholders of Siemens AG in the course of the Spin -off will ensure sufficient liq uidity of the 
Siemens Energy Share on the stock exchange.

Agreement – is in Siemens AG's best interest. This assessment is based, in particular, on the 
following reasons:  
 The Siemens Energy Business is to be conducted by Siemens Energy  AG autonomously 
and independently of Siemens  AG. As a consequence, Siemens Energy AG will be able to 
develop autonomously and independently, a fact which the managing boards of Siemens 
AG and Sie mens Energy AG believe should also have a positive effect on the market 
assessment of the Siemens Shares and the Siemens Energy Shares. Siemens Energy AG is 
deliberately placed on the capital market separately and independently of Siemens AG, 
which may mak e the Siemens Energy Shares  more attractive for certain investors.  
 The managing board of Siemens AG is confident that the deconsolidation effected by the 
waiver of the controlling influence will improve the financial performance indicators and 
may thus have a positive effect on how Siemens AG is perceived in the market an d on the 
pricing of the Siemens Energy Share s. 
 Moreover, in the view of Siemens AG's managing board, the remaining participation as 
non-controlling  anchor shareholder offers the advantage that the existing conglomerate 
discount on the Siemens Share could d ecrease (as regards the reduction of the 
conglomerate discount, see Chapter  III.1.e) above).  
The conclusion of the Deconsolidation  Agreement also results in certain disadvantages for Siemens 
AG, which Siemens AG's managing board took into account when it d ecided in favor of the 
conclusion of the Deconsolidation  Agreement.  
 One disadvantage resulting under the Deconsolidation  Agreement is that Siemens AG can 
only be represented with fewer representatives (no more than three) of the shareholder 
representatives  on the supervisory board of Siemens Energy AG. As a result of the reduced 
influence in the supervisory board, Siemens AG may no longer have the power to procure 
a certain optimal composition of the managing board or to prevent transactions that 
Siemens AG  considers disadvantageous for Siemens Energy AG and that require the 
approval of the supervisory board . 
 In this context, Siemens AG's managing board also took into consideration that Siemens 
AG and other Future Siemens Group Companies are liable for a considerable amount for 
obligations of the Future Siemens Energy Group on account of the fact that the Siemens 
Gas and Power Business previously was conducted by the Siemens Group and because of 
outstanding guarantees and other collateral provided by the S iemens Group for the Siemens 
Energy  Business.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  66  The loss of control of Siemens AG over the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies that 
occurs as a result of the Spin -off and the conclusion of the Deconsolidation  Agreement 
may trigger termination rights, purchasing rights or other rights of the relevant contractual 
partner of joint venture agreements or other continuing obligations based on change of 
control clauses.  
 In addition, the loss of a controlling influenc e results in the loss of statutory group 
privileges, in particular under antitrust law and under the German Banking Act 
(Kreditwesengesetz – "KWG "). Furthermore, it is generally recognized that an 
independent company has the right to provide to the control ling company a broad range of 
information, including trade and business secrets and other confidential information that is 
subject to the  strict corporate confidentiality duty of the managing board pursuant to 
Section  93 (1) sentence  3 AktG. This privilege  also cease s to apply.  
Having carefully weighted all advantages and disadvantages, the managing board of Siemens AG 
is convinced that the above -described  advantages of the abandonment  of a controlling position 
clearly outweigh the disadvantages resulting t herefrom.  
5. Decision for the Spin -off by Absorption  
The managing board of Siemens AG decided in favor of the Spin -off by absorption under 
Section  123 (2) no. 1 UmwG and, thus, against the spin -off by way of establishing a new company 
(Section  123 (2) no. 2 UmwG). The spin -off by absorption is differentiated from  establishing  new 
companies by the fact that the receiving entity (in this case, Siemens Energy AG) already exists 
prior to the spin -off. This is the basic prerequisite for the intended goal of a (direct and indirect) 
minority participation of Siemens AG in Siemens Energy AG which will be created by Siemens 
AG contributing anapproximately  32.98  % participation in Siemens Energy KG and by SBI  GmbH 
contributing its approximately  12.02 % participation in Siemens Energy KG in exchange for the 
granting of shares in Siemens Energy AG (see on this point, the detailed  description in 
Chapter  VI.3.). This would not have been easily possible if Siemens Energy AG first had to be 
newly establi shed under the Spin -off. 
Furthermore, the shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG will still be able to take measures 
to prepare Siemens Energy AG for the capital market prior to the Spin -off taking effect, for example 
granting  the authorization to acqu ire treasury shares after the Spin -off takes effect as well as by 
resolving authorized and conditional capital.  
Since a spin -off audit is required by  law in the case of a spin -off by  absorption contrary to the spin -
off by way of newly establishing a compan y while preserving the proportionate shareholdings ( cf. 
in this regard, Chapter  VI.8.), additional costs are incurred compared to the spin -off by establishing 
a new company while preserving the proportionate shareholdings. However, these costs are not 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  67 mate rial compared to the described benefits, also taking into account the overall costs related to the 
Spin-off. 
  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  68 IV. Spin -off Assets  
The legally defined Spin -off Assets are (i)  a partial partnership interest ( Kommanditanteil ) in 
Siemens  Energy  KG and (ii)  shares in the General Partner GmbH (" Spin -off Assets "). The Siemens 
Energy Business is bundled in the Siemens Energy KG and is managed operationally by it.  Due to 
the Spin -off, the Siemens Shareholders  will hold a majority stake in the Siemens Energy Busi ness 
through Siemens Energy  AG. 
1. Siemens Energy KG  
Siemens Energy KG, formed through the partnership agreement dated 9  August  2019 by 
Siemens  AG and the General Partner GmbH , has its registered office in Munich and is registered 
with the register of compani es of the district court of Munich under registration number 
HRA  111200. The General Partner GmbH is the sole personally liable shareholder ( general partner 
(Komplementärin )) without an interest in the fixed capital. At the time of its formation, the fixed  
capital of Siemens  Energy  KG was EUR  1,000. It was raised and held entirely by Siemens  AG as 
sole limited partner ( Kommanditistin ). In connection with  the Carve -out, the fixed capital of 
Siemens  Energy  KG was raised several times to now EUR  174,908,333 and SBI GmbH took on 
interest in Siemens  Energy  KG (see in  this regard Chapter  V., in particular Chapter  V.1.d)).  
Following completion of the Carve -out, the ownership structure is as follows: SBI GmbH currently 
holds a partnership interest representing a pro rata amount of the fixed capital of 
Siemens  Energy  KG of EUR  21,015,601 (corresponding to approximately  12.02  % of the total 
fixed capital) and Siemens  AG currently holds a partnership interest representing a pro rata  amount 
of the fixed capital of Siemen s Energy  KG of EUR  153,892,732 (corresponding to approximately  
87.98  % of the total fixed capital).  
By amendment of the partnership agreement, the name of "Siemens Gas and Power GmbH & Co. 
KG" shall in the future  be changed to "Siemens Energy Global GmbH &  Co. KG".  
Under the partnership agreement, the object of Siemens  Energy  KG is to manufacture, supply, 
operate, distribute and trade in products, systems, facilities and solutions and to render 
maintenance, repair and other services, as well as research and  development, in the areas of energy 
production, transfer, distribution and storage, in the areas of oil and gas across all areas of 
production, in the areas of decarbonization, sector coupling, hydrogen solutions and other 
renewable and non -renewable ener gy sources as well as the adjacent fields of activity such as 
electrical engineering, automation, electronics, precision mechanics and mechanical engineering. 
Siemens  Energy  KG can operate in the context of these activities in all information technology 
fields (including electronic data processing and transfer, software, platforms and self -learning 
systems) and render related services. Moreover, Siemens  Energy  KG, in particular through its 
consoli dated subsidiaries, can operate  in the financial sector and p articipate directly or indirectly in 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  69 enterprises and companies of any type, also in managing its own assets. Finally, 
Siemens  Energy  KG may engage in business of any kind and take any and all measures related to, 
or which seem to be directly or indirectly useful in promoting, the above activities. Siemens Energy 
KG may realize its object itself or through consolidated subsidiaries or associated companies 
(including joint ventures). It can confine itself to some of the activities mentioned above. Siemens 
Energy KG can set up associated companies, acquire participating interests and change them 
structurally, bring them under uniform control or may limit itself to managing the participating 
interest, sell participating interests and also conclude enterprise and  cooperation agreements of any 
kind.  
Due to the legal and organizational bundling of the Siemens Energy Business in 
Siemens  Energy  KG, Siemens  Energy  KG from now on will operate the Siemens Energy Business 
both directly and indirectly (see Chapter  V.1.).  
2. General Partner  GmbH  
The General Partner GmbH, with its registered office in Munich, was formed as a shell company 
by Blitzstart Holding AG on 24  May 2018 under the name Blitz  18-677 GmbH and was registered 
on 4 June 2018 with the register of companies of t he district court of Munich under the registration 
number HRB  241345. Its share capital consists of EUR  25,000 , split into 25, 000 shares, each with 
a nominal value of EUR  1.00, with the consecutive numbers 1 through 25,000. By means of a share 
purchase and  transfer agreement dated 12  June 2018, Siemens AG acquired from 
Blitzstart  Holding  AG all shares of the company which today operates as the General Partner 
GmbH. At the same time, the company changed its name to Kyros  57 GmbH.  
On 9  August  2019, today's Ge neral Partner GmbH signed a partnership agreement with Siemens 
AG for the formation of Siemens Energy KG, by which the General Partner GmbH became 
commercially active for the first time. At this time, the company again changed its name from 
Kyros 57 GmbH to Siemens Gas and Power Management GmbH and the business purpose was 
amended  accordingly. Since then, the company has been the general partner of Siemens Energy  
KG and manages its business.  
SBI GmbH acquired all shares in the General Partner GmbH from Siemens AG through the 
contribution agreement dated 31  March  2020. On 30  March  2020 , Siemens AG then acquired from 
SBI GmbH 21,996  shares (corresponding to  approxim ately  87.98  % of the share capital of the 
General Partner GmbH).  
Under the articles of association, the object of the General Partner GmbH is to manage its own 
assets as well as to participate in other companies as a personally liable managing partner, in 
particular with respect to Siemens Energy KG. The company may eng age in business of any kind 
and take any and all measures related to, or which seem to be directly or indirectly useful in 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE

in other domestic or foreign compa nies, it can form branch offices and conclude enterprise 
agreements and enter into interest groups.  
The directors of the General Partner GmbH are currently: Tim Oliver Holt, who was appointed on 
23 October  2019 with effect as of 1  November  2019 until 31  October  2024; Dr.  Ing Jochen

Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  72 V. Carve -out of the Siemens Energy  Business in Preparation of the Spin -off 
In preparation for the Spin -off, the Siemens Energy Business was legally and organizationally 
consolidated under the umbrella of Siemens Energy KG as described in detail below (for a detailed 
description of Siemens Energy KG, see Chapter  IV.1 above).  
1. Bundling of the Siemens Energy Business in Siemens Energy KG  
 General Approach to Separating the Assets and Legal Relationships  
The organizational work of legally and organizationally separating the Siemens Energy Business 
within the Siemens Group began directly following the announcement of the planned legal 
separation of the Siemens E nergy Business in May 2019.  
As a first step, the assets and legal relationships allocated to the Siemens Energy Business and 
therefore to be bundled in or under Siemens Energy KG were identified  and determined in 
accordance with the basic structure of the Future Siemens Energy Group (in this regard, see 
Chapter  III.2). For the central functions (for example, legal, accounting, tax), the respective central 
departments and units  of Siemens AG mostly were organizationally divided into new business 
divisions in  preparation for the legal separation and the employees  were allocated either to the 
departments and units  that were to remain with Siemens AG or to the corresponding new 
departments and units  created for the Future Siemens Energy Group. In total, approxim ately 1,400 
employees in central functions were allocated to the newly created business operations and business 
divisions.  
For each country in which a separation of the local business activities from the rest of the business 
of the Siemens Group was necess ary (each a " Local Carve -out"), taking into account tax, 
operational and strategic aspects, a concept was developed to ensure a separation of the 
employment relationships, assets, contracts, liabilities and investments that belong to the respective 
Siemens  Energy Business of a country (" Local Siemens Energy Business ") that provides legal 
certainty. The precise scope of the Local Siemens Energy Business was determined based on  the 
guidelines  for the  structure of the Siemens Energy Business (in this regard, s ee Chapter  III.2).  
The business divisions were separated not solely by way of allocating employees to respective 
divisions, but also based on organizational, spatial and functional considerations. In addition , the 
relevant accounting areas ( Buchungskreise ) of the various business divisions were separated.  
To the extent that a Local Carve -out was not necessary because the Local Siemens Energy Business 
was already operated by an independent company, the existing companies were transferred directly 
or indirect ly to Siemens Energy KG without any further preparatory measures.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  73 With regard to the local Gas and Power business that is not or not shortly to be transferred to the 
Future Siemens Energy Group, in connection with the Carve -out, see Chapter  III.2.c).  
 Trans fer of the German Siemens Energy Business Operations from Siemens  AG to 
Siemens Energy KG  
Effective  as of 1  January 2020, Siemens AG transferred to Siemens Energy KG the German 
Siemens Gas and Power Business, which was held directly by Siemens AG, as well as other 
domestic and foreign investments, assets and legal relationships directly attributable to the Siemens 
Energy Business, including the shares in SGRE S.A. which, at the time, were directly held by 
Siemens AG (in the amount of approximately 30  % of S GRE S.A.'s issued shares) as well as the 
newly created central departments for the Future Siemens Energy Group (subject to special cases 
as set forth in Chapter  V.4) (together the " German Siemens Energy Business Operations ") (with 
regard to the contributio n of the additional share s in SGRE S.A., originally held by SBI GmbH, 
amounting to approximately 29  % of the issued shares, as well as the contribution of the additional 
share s in SGRE S.A., acquired by Siemens AG in the meantime, amounting to approximatel y 8 % 
of the issued shares, see Chapter  V.1.d) below). In this context, Siemens AG contributed the 
German Siemens Energy Business Operations to Siemens Energy KG at book value by means of a 
notarial contribution agreement dated 20  December 2019 with effect  as of 1  January 2020, 
0.00 hours . In exchange, the interest held by Siemens AG in the fixed capital of Siemens Energy 
KG was increased by EUR  19,999,000, from EUR  1,000 to  EUR 20,000,000.  
The following assets in particular have been transferred from Sieme ns AG to Siemens Energy KG 
as part of the German Siemens Energy Business Operations:  
 Movable assets of the German Siemens Energy Business Operations: all moveable 
property, especially machinery, equipment, tools, vehicles, IT hardware, inventory, spare  
parts, office material, as well as records, bills and invoices, books and other documents 
which were attributable to the German Sieme ns Energy Business Operations.  
 Intellectual property: The assets to be transferred also include the patents that belonged to 
Siemens AG as of 31  December 2019 and that had largely been financed internally by the 
Siemens Gas and Power Business; furthermore, the trademark and name rights that are 
exclusively used and were financed by the Siemens Gas and Power Business and that do 
not contain any Siemens designation; and the know -how that is mostly used by the Siemens 
Gas and Power Business as well as the software mainly used or financed by it. In the 
transferred intellectual property, Siemens AG received a back license for use withi n the 
existing business areas of the Future Siemens Group (with regard to the Future Siemens 
Group in more detail, see Chapter  IX.1). Siemens AG issued vice versa  to Siemens Energy 
KG a license for patents, know -how and software owned by Siemens AG and use d by the 
Siemens Gas and Power Business  but not transferred to Siemens Energy KG , for further 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  74 use within the existing business areas  of the Siemens Gas and Power Business . The mutual 
licenses are valid  worldwide  and are  indefinite, irrevocable, free of charge , under certain 
conditions transferable and sub-licensable, and of non -exclusive nature . Intellectual 
property contained in the products or services which form  the portfolio of the business 
remaining in the Future Si emens Group and which have been acquired against payment by 
the Siemens Gas and Power Business prior to the C arve-out is neither licensed nor 
transferred to the Future Siemens Energy Group . The Future Siemens  Energy Group may 
continue to acquire  such produ cts or services from the Future Siemens  Group.  The transfer 
of individual license agreements regarding intellectual property of third parties is usually 
subject to the consent of third parties. In particular, the  complete  transfer of the so -called 
Intellec tual Property Agreement concluded between Siemens AG and Rolls -Royce plc. is 
subject to the involvement of Rolls -Royce plc. Under the Intellectual Property Agreement, 
Rolls -Royce plc. has granted the Siemens Group extensive licenses to use technology 
relev ant to the aeroderivative gas turbine business acquired by the Siemens Group in 2014. 
Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG are currently formalizing the transfer of the 
Intellectual Property Agreement and are currently in negotiations with Rolls -Royce plc. 
regarding the transfer of the right of Siemens AG to acquire future significant technological 
developments from Rolls -Royce plc. or its subsidiaries.  The Intellectual Property 
Agreement also contains protective  clauses in favor of Rolls -Royce plc. in the event that a 
competitor of Rolls -Royce plc. acquires at least 30  % of the outstanding shares of the 
licensee. With the transfer of the Intellectual Property Agreement these provisions will 
then apply to Siemens Energy KG.  
 Lease agreements: Siemens Energy KG is continuing to use the production, manufacturing, 
storage, office and other business spaces that are attributable to the German Siemens 
Energy Business Operations.  For this purpose, Siemens  AG has transferre d to Siemens 
Energy KG the lease agreements which are either exclusively or mostly attributable to the 
German Siemens Energy Business Operations, and Siemens Energy KG has entered into 
new leases with landlords or principal tenants with respect to the prod uction, 
manufacturing, storage, office and other business spaces that are used by the German 
Siemens Energy Business Operations. In cases where  the owner, landlord or principal 
tenant ha d not consented to a transfer of the lease from Siemens AG to Siemens Energy 
KG, Siemens Energy KG entered into new sublease agreements with Siemens AG.  
 Real property: The ownership of the real property in Germany that is attributable to the 
Siemens Energy Business was not subject to the transfer of the German Siemens Energ y 
Business Operations. Instead, this real property was previously bundled in Siemens Gas 
and Power Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG. Siemens AG sold a share amounting to 89  % of 
the fixed capital of Siemens Gas and Power Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG as well as all o f 
the shares in its personally liable partner to Kyros  60 GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  75 of Siemens Energy KG, by means of a notarial sale and transfer agreement dated 27  March 
2020. With respect to the remaining share amounting to 11  % of the fixed capit al of 
Siemens Gas and Power Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG, mutual option agreements were 
entered into under the same notarial sale and transfer agreement. First, Siemens AG may 
exercise a sale option until 21  April 2022 for the 11  % share in the fixed capital of Siemens 
Gas and Power Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG; if Siemens AG chooses not to exercise this 
option, Kyros 60 GmbH, beginning on 21  April 2023 , is in turn entitled to exercise a 
purchase option that is unlimited in time. If the option is exercised, the p urchase price – 
which is intended to correspond to the market value of the share to be transferred – is to be 
determined by a neutral expert on the basis of predetermined valuation criteria.  
 Shares: Siemens AG has transferred to Siemens Energy KG the share s in domestic and 
foreign subsidiaries and holding companies directly held by Siemens AG and exclusively 
attributable to the German Siemens Energy Business Operations. These shares included, 
in particular, approximately 30  % of the shares held directly by Siemens AG in SGRE S.A. 
at that time as well as shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures.  The Future Siemens Energy  
Group thus assumes all rights and obligations arising from the shares and related 
agreements, including possible non -competition clauses in joint ventures; in general, in 
isolated cases the Future S iemens  Group may still be bound by post -contractual 
compe tition restraints for a temporary period with regard to transferred interests in joint 
ventures.  
 Contracts: The contracts exclusively attributable to the German Siemens Energy Business 
Operations, in particular the customer and supply agreements of Siemens  AG, have been 
transferred to Siemens Energy KG. Insofar as certain agreements could not (yet) be 
transferred to Siemens Energy KG as a result of legal requirements – for example due to 
the lack of the required consent by third parties – Siemens AG and Sie mens Energy KG 
have agreed to place each other in the same economic position as if the respective 
agreements had already been transferred to Siemens Energy KG.  
 Liabilities: The liabilities that are exclusively attributable to the German Siemens Energy 
Business Operations have also been transferred to Siemens Energy KG. This includes the 
liability for collateral provided by Siemens AG and certain Future Siemens Group 
Companies (partially also banks and insurance companies) in favor of the German and 
worldwid e Siemens Energy Business. Insofar as an external transfer was not possible due 
to the lack of a required third party consent, the economic effect of such liabilities has been 
transferred by way of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG agreeing in the internal 
relationship to place each other in the same economic position as if the respective liabilities 
had been transferred.

Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  76  Indemnification OL 3: Internally between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG, the 
contract with the customer for the construction of the new reactor block 3 in the nuclear 
power plant Olkiluoto, Finland, as well as the associated consortium agreement with Areva 
NP S.A.S. and Areva GmbH were also transferred, i.e. Siemens AG continues to be liable 
for all obligations externally, while Siemens En ergy KG is responsible for the project 
realization internally and thus basically bears the opportunities and risks of project 
implementation. This applies in particular to risks in the event of delayed commissioning 
or failure to commission the reactor uni t. With regard to certain liability risks, however, 
Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG have, in deviation from the fundamental transfer of 
all risks associated with the Siemens Energy Business to Siemens Energy KG, agreed that 
Siemens Energy KG will be indem nified by Siemens AG starting at  a threshold value of 
EUR  83 million . 
 All other transferable legal rights and obligations of Siemens AG that were exclusively 
attributable to the German Siemens Energy Business Operations, for example, transferable 
public law permits ( see also Chapter  V.12 ), have been transferred to Siemens Energy KG.  
The transfer of the German Siemens Energy Business Operations did not include existing financing 
by SFS or Siemens AG for the benefit of customers and partners of the Siemens Energy Business. 
Rather, these financings are part of the business of SFS and, therefore, remain in the Future Siemens 
Group.  
As of 31  December 2019, approximately 26,000 employees were working in the German Siemens 
Energy Business Operations ( including  central functions) , whose employment contracts were 
transferred to Siemens Energy KG pursuant to Section  613a German Civil Code ( Bürgerliches 
Gesetzbuch , "BGB "). With regard to the transfer of further employees, see Chapter  V.4 below.  
In view of the transfer of the German Siemens Energy Business Operations from Siemens AG to 
Siemens Energy KG, a collective agreement ( Tarifvertrag ) has been concluded on 7 November 
2019 between the locally responsible employers' associations of the metal and electrical industry 
(represented by vbm, Verband der Bayerischen Metall - und Elektro -Industrie  e.V.) and IG  Metall 
"for the temporary continuation of the special collective agreement ( Tarifvertragliche 
Sondervereinbarung (TvSV))  dated 29  September  2014  at Siemens Gas and 
Power  GmbH  & Co. KG" (" Collective Agreement on Continued Application "). Accordingly, 
the special collective agreement dated 29  September  2014 (" Special Collective Agreement ") 
including the list of collective agreements of the Bavarian m etal and electrical industry referred to 
in the Special Collective Agreement (including the newly incorporated collective agreements 
TV T-ZUG, TV  MobA and TV  Lanzeitkonto) as well as the collective umbrella agreement 
(Gemeinsamer Manteltarifvertrag ) for em ployees within the scope of the Special Collective 
Agreement in its version from 15  June 2018, the collective umbrella wage agreement 
(Gemeinsamer Entgeltrahmentarifvertrag ) for employees within the scope of the Special 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  77 Collective Agreement and the collect ive wage agreement ( Gemeinsamer Entgelttarifvertrag ) dated 
7 May 2018, each in its version valid at the time and with each current legal status  valid until 
30 September 2020. After 30  September  2020, the aforementioned collective agreements are to be 
repla ced by the respective areal collective agreements ( Flächentarifverträge ) in the metal and 
electrical industry and employees are to be transferred into the scope of a regional areal collective 
agreement. The transfer is executed in accordance with the trans itional rules pursuant to §  5 of the 
Special Collective Agreement. The parties may, by mutual consent, shorten the period of temporary 
continuation of the Special Collective Agreement and agree that the Special Collective Agreement 
shall cease to apply bef ore 30  September  2020. The introduction of the areal collective agreements 
can therefore be moved up on the timeline. The geographical  / functional scope of the Collective 
Agreement on Continued Application includes all organizational units of the Siemens Gas and 
Power Business of Siemens  AG or of Siemens Energy  KG which were based in the branches of 
Siemens  AG prior to the works constitutional spin -off and merger or integration of the operations 
as well as such organizational units which derive from Siemen s Real Estate Restaurant Services 
and Personnel Services at the locations of Siemens Energy  KG as a result of the transfer of these 
organizational units from Siemens  AG to Siemens Energy  KG. The personal scope of the 
Collective Agreement on Continued Appli cation includes those employees who were under the 
scope of the Special Collective Agreement at Siemens  AG. 
 Carve -out of the Local Siemens Energy Business  
In all other countries in which the respective Local Siemens Energy Business was not conducted in 
a separate legal entity and to the extent that a transfer to the Future Siemens Energy Group has not 
been refrained from until further notice (see Chapter  III.2.c) for the Siemens Energy Business not 
transferred), the relevant Local Siemens Energy Business w as separated from the other Siemens 
business in general as of 31  March 2020.  
The separations were largely implemented through the formation of new local legal entities to 
which the Local Siemens Energy Business was transferred either through corporate or 
transformation law measures under local law (e.g. through spin -offs) or based on purchase 
agreements (classic carve -outs). In some countries (for example the Netherlands, Philippines and 
Sweden), the Local Siemens Energy Business was transferred into an alr eady existing local legal 
entity that was attributable  to the Future Siemens Energy Group. The result of classic carve -outs is 
generally that the local Future Siemens Group Company can be held liable for obligations or that 
it is affected by other conseque nces from former activities that are attributable to the Local Siemens 
Energy Business. It has therefore been agreed in each case that the respective Future Siemens 
Energy Group Company will indemnify the respective Future Siemens Group Company from any 
such liability. However, disadvantages may nevertheless arise in the future for the respective local 
Future Siemens Group Company to the extent that an indemnification is not possible (e.g. exclusion 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  78 from public procurement procedures  due to previous violati ons of law from the sphere of the 
Siemens Energy Business).  
In other countries (for example in Brazil, Norway and Israel), the separation has been implemented 
by means of a so -called reverse carve -out. In such cases, the existing local Siemens Group 
Compan ies transferred the employment agreements, assets, contracts, liabilities and shareholdings  
pertaining to the other local Siemens Business (" Local Remaining Siemens Business ") to newly 
formed Future Siemens Group Companies, either by means of corporate or transformation law 
measures or on the basis of a purchase contract (all of the local separation agreements which were 
made in the course of a Local Carve -out, whether in the classic or reverse form, are here inafter 
referred to as Local Asset Transfer Agree ments, or " LATAs "). The previously existing local 
Siemens Company (as Future Siemens Energy Group Company) should only retain the respective 
Local Siemens Energy Business. Consequently , the respective  Future Siemens Energy Group 
Company may be held liable for obligations, or may be affected by other consequences from earlier 
activities that are attributable to the Local Remaining Siemens Business. Therefore, it has been 
agreed in each case that the respective Future Siemens Group Company will indemnify the 
respective Future Siemens Energy Group Company from such liability. Similar indemnifications 
have been agreed in cases where the Local Remaining Siemens Business is not carved out of the 
Future Siemens Energy Group Company, but is instead wound up by the F uture Siemens Energy 
Group Company.  Despite the indemnification, there is the possibility that disadvantages arise for 
the respective local Future Siemens Energy Group Company in the future. In the case of Siemens  
Ltda, Brazil, a Future Siemens Energy Grou p Company in Brazil, it cannot be excluded that in the 
course of legal disputes/proceedings in connection with its previous activities, attributable to the 
Local Remaining Siemens Business, Siemens Ltda, Brazil  may be barred  from public procurement 
procedu res or even be prohibited from carrying on its business.   
Following  the above mentioned  measures , the shares in the local Future Siemens Energy Group 
Companies, which, following the execution of the LATAs, then basically only hold the respective 
Local Siemens Energy Business, were generally transferred to Siemens Gas and Power 
Holding  B.V. (a Future Siemens Energy Group Company under the laws of the Netherlands; see 
below, Chapter  V.1.d, regarding the contribution of Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V. into 
Siemens Energy KG). The transfer was then effected by selling the shares in the local Future 
Siemens Energy Group Company on the basis of purchase agreements (so -called Local Share 
Transfer Agreements, “ LSTAs ”). In some cases, the respective local Future Siemens Energy Group 
Company was already formed and funded for the acquisition of the respective Local Siemens 
Energy Business by Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V.  Siemens AG provided the purchase 
price agreed upon in the respective LSTA or LATA to Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V., or 
Siemens Energy KG, as the case may be, (if applicable, indirectl y via intermediary holding 
companies) in the form of a shareholder contribution by 31  March 2020.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  79 In other cases, certain Local Siemens Energy Businesses, especially the Local Siemens Energy 
Business in the U nited States , were not separated by way of a Loc al Carve -out and bundled into 
Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V.; instead the shares in the already existing local Future 
Siemens Energy Group Companies were contributed into or transferred to Siemens Energy  KG or 
Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V. (in thi s regard, see also Chapter  V.1.d)).  
The local Future Siemens Energy Group Company in France was transferred to Siemens Gas and 
Power Holding B.V. by means of a contribution. In exchange, the contributing French legal entity, 
Siemens France Holding S.A.S., which remains a company of the Future Siemens Group, received 
a participation in Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V. at the time of the contribution in the amount 
of 1.7  %. This participation in Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V. will likely continue until at 
least June 2022. Thereafter, the share can be sold to Siemens Energy KG. A shareholder agreement 
has been entered into for this purpose which provides for a put option in favor of Siemens France 
Holding S.A.S.  
 Further Bundling of the Siemens Energy Busi ness into Siemens Energy KG  
Following the transfer of the German Siemens Energy Business Operations to Siemens Energy KG 
as well as the implementation of the respective Local Carve -outs in the individual countries, the 
following further steps have been imp lemented in order to bundle all of the companies attributable 
to the Future Siemens Energy Group under the umbrella of Siemens Energy KG and to create the 
existing ownership structures in Siemens Energy KG:  
 Based on a contribution agreement dated 31  Januar y 2020, Siemens AG transferred to SBI 
GmbH at book value its entire partnership interest in Siemens Energy KG, which also 
represented the entire fixed capital of Siemens Energy KG in the amount of 
EUR  20,000,000 existing at the time, including all shares i n the General Partner GmbH, in 
exchange for the granting of new shares in SBI GmbH. On the same day, SBI GmbH 
contributed to Kyros 63 GmbH at book value, a wholly owned subsidiary of SBI GmbH, 
its shares in SGRE S.A. in the amount of approximately 29  % of all issued shares of SGRE 
S.A. 
 Based on a joinder agreement dated 13  March 2020, Siemens AG joined Siemens Energy 
KG as additional limited partner in exchange for payment of a cash contribution. For this 
purpose, Siemens Energy KG increased its fixed capit al by EUR  457,000 from 
EUR  20,000,000 to EUR  20,457,000, with Siemens AG acquiring a partnership interest in 
the full amount of the increase . 
 On 30  March 2020, Kyros 63 GmbH contributed to Siemens Energy KG at book value  its 
shares in SGRE S.A. in the amount of approximately  29 % of all issued shares of SGRE 
S.A. in exchange for a new partnership interest in the amount of EUR  19,937,880. For this 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  80 purpose, Siemens Energy KG increased its fixed capital from previously EUR  20,457,000 
to EU R 40,394,880. Kyros 63 GmbH then, also on 30  March 2020, sold its newly acquired 
partnership interest to Siemens AG.  
 Based on an agreement dated 30  March 2020 and with effect as of 31  March 2020, Siemens 
AG contributed to Siemens Energy KG in exchange for an increase in Siemens AG's 
partnership interest in Siemens Energy KG by EUR  133,497,852, from previously 
EUR  20,394,880 to EUR  153,892,732, all of Siemens AG's shares in (i)  Siemens Gas and 
Power Holding B.V., in which a large part of the Future Siemens E nergy Group Companies 
has been bundled ( cf. Chapter  V.1.c)), (ii)  Siemens Energy Inc., in which the Local 
Siemens Energy Business in the United States  has been bundled, and (iii)  Siemens Gas and 
Power, S.A., in which the Local Siemens Energy Business in Sp ain is bundled, as well as 
shares in SGRE S.A. in the amount of  approximately 8 % of all issued shares of SGRE 
S.A., which Siemens AG had in the meantime acquired from the Iberdrola Group. At the 
same time, Siemens AG provided to Siemens Energy KG liquid a ssets in the amount of 
approximately EUR  6.2 billion  for the purpose of achieving the envisaged capitalization of 
the Future Siemens Energy Group; from this figure, an amount of approximately EUR  4.1 
billion  will be needed in order to discharge existing li abilities and satisfy the purchase price 
obligations to Future Siemens Group Companies for further future asset transfers (in this 
regard, see Chapter  V.1.e); from this figure, a further sum in the amount of EUR  393 
million  is planned for the implementatio n of a share buy -back program of Siemens Energy 
AG upon admission of Siemens Energy AG 's shares to the stock exchange in the near future 
(a period of  presumably  six months is envisaged  for the share buy -back ) (the shares bought 
back under the program will be used for the execution of a stock -based compensation 
program within the Future Siemens Energy Group) . Under the same agreement, SBI GmbH 
contributed all of its shares in further companies (Dresser Rand do Brazil, Ltda., Sao Paulo, 
Brazil; Trench Germany  GmbH, Bamberg; Siemens Power Control GmbH, Langen 
(Hessen) ) to Siemens Energy KG in exchange for increasing SBI GmbH 's interest in the 
fixed capital in Siemens Energy KG by EUR  1,015,601 from previously EUR  20,000,000 
to EUR  21,015,601.  
By the close of 31  March 2020, the ownership structure in Siemens Energy KG is as follows: The 
entire fixed capital of Siemens Energy KG amounts to EUR  174,908,333. Siemens AG holds a 
partnership interest representing an amount of the fixed capital of EUR  153,892,732, corre sponding 
to approximately  87.98  % of the fixed capital, and SBI  GmbH holds a partnership interest 
representing an amount of the fixed capital of EUR  21,015,601, corresponding to approximately  
12.02  % of the fixed capital. The General Partner GmbH is the sole personally liable partner without 
any interest in the fixed capital.

Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  81 
 Transfers after 31  March 2020  
In several countries, the Local Carve -out and/or the transfer of the respective local Future Siemens 
Energy Group Company to Siemens Gas and Power Holdi ng B.V. or Siemens Energy KG, as the 
case may be, could not be completed prior to 1  April 2020 for operational reasons, due to local 
legal restrictions  or for other reasons. While the relevant agreements were each entered into prior 
to 1 April 2020, they c ould not be executed prior to that date (although in the United Kingdom, in 
South Africa, in Poland (all classic carve -outs) and  in Thailand (reverse carve -out) the execution 
did become effective on 1  April 2020 and the Local Carve -outs in these countries are therefore not 
further mentioned in this Chapter  V.1.e)). For these cases, Siemens  AG provided to Siemens 
Energy KG or another Future Siemens Energy Group Company – by the expiry of  31 March 2020 
– an amount by way of a shareholder contribution that cor responds to the anticipated purchase 
prices according to the respective LATAs and/or LSTAs (see above in Chapter  V.1.c)). In addition, 
in some countries the establishment of branches  / representations of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group is delayed beyond 1  April 2020 (for lack of economic relevance, no further details are 
provided here ). 
 Classic Carve -out Cases  
Binding contractual agreements were entered into in the form of LATAs (and, if additionally 
required, LSTAs) with respect to the transfer of the Loca l Siemens Energy Business prior to 
31 March 2020 , but have not been executed  yet. This was particularly the case in China (with the 
exception of participations in certain joint ventures, with regard to joint ventures see 
Chapter  V.1.f)), Japan and Saudi -Arabia; with regard to Qatar, a framework agreement was 
concluded.  The relevant LATAs generally provide for the economic and legal transfer of the Local 
Siemens Energy Business to Future Siemens Energy Group Companies at a point in time after 
31 March 2020. In the cases of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the purchase prices set forth in the 
agreements are preliminary and will be adjusted to the relevant conditions prevailing on the actual 
transfer effective date in accordance with an adjustment methodology agreed in advance. Purchase 
prices for Japan and China are fixed.  
The following applies for the individual countries mentioned above:  
 The Local Siemens Energy Business in China fully held by the Siemens Group  (revenue in 
fiscal year 2019: EUR 315 million) was not transferred until 31 March 2020 but only before 
22 May 2020. Further, the transfer of several subsidiaries not fully held by the Siemens 
Group as well as joint ventures in China is delayed until June 2 020 for technical reasons . 
With regard to the joint venture Shanghai Electric Power Generation Equipment Co. LTD. , 
Shanghai , see Chapter  V.1.f).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  82  The Local Siemens Energy Business affected in Japan generated revenues of 
approximately EUR  26 million  in the f iscal year 2019. Execution of the transfer is currently 
expected to occur in early June 2020 . 
 In Saudi Arabia, the Local Siemens Energy Business is conducted with the involvement of 
external third parties. It generate d revenues of approximately EUR  248 million in the fiscal 
year 2019. Execution of the transfer is currently expected to occur in early June 2020 . 
 In Qatar, the Local Siemens Energy Business also is conducted with the involvement of 
external third parties. It generated revenues of approximately EUR  214 million  in the fiscal 
year 2019. The execution of the Local Carve -out was delayed owing to lengthy processes 
in connection with establishing a local Future Siemens Energy Group Company. 
Accordingly, an agreement between Future Siemens Group Compani es and Future 
Siemens Energy Group Companies has been concluded at a higher corporate level to 
further implement the Carve -out. A further implementation and execution of the Local 
Carve -out in Qatar is currently expected for early July 2020.  
 Reverse Carve -out Cases  
In the countries Argentina, Egypt, Bangladesh, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates, it has 
been possible to enter into binding contractual agreements in the form of LATAs on the transfer of 
the relevant Local Remaining Siemens Business to a  Future Siemens Group Company, and in the 
form of LSTAs on the transfer of the shares in former Siemens regional companies (as Future 
Siemens Energy Group Companies) to Future Siemens Energy Group Companies (also referred to 
as reverse carve -out cases). Ho wever, the agreements could not (or at least not entirely) be executed 
by 31  March 2020. All the purchase prices specified in the LATAs (except for Argentina) are 
preliminary in nature and will still be adjusted to the relevant conditions prevailing on the  actual 
transfer effective date in accordance with a valuation methodology agreed in advance. Accordingly, 
the purchase prices in the relevant LSTAs will be adjusted to the final valuation as well. In detail, 
the following applies:  
 The Local Siemens Energy  Business in Argentina generated revenues in the amount of 
approximately EUR  137 million  in the fiscal year 2019. The business will be separated by 
reorganization (including measures under transformation law), which means that a classic 
purchase price paym ent will no longer be necessary. The relevant agreements were  
executed in early May 2020.  
 In Egypt, the Local Siemens Energy Business is conducted with the involvement of 
external third parties. It generated revenues of approximately EUR  114 million  in the  fiscal 
year 2019. Execution of the transfer is currently expected to occur in early June 2020.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  83  The Local Siemens Energy Business affected in Bangladesh generated revenues of 
approximately EUR  14 million  in the fiscal year 2019. Execution of the transfer i s currently 
expected to occur in December 2020 and, thus, presumably not until after the Spin -off takes 
effect. The delay is owing to lengthy local registration procedures.  
 In Kuwait, the Local Siemens Energy Business is conducted with the involvement of 
external third parties. It generated revenues of approximately EUR  47 million  in the fiscal 
year 2019. Execution of the transfer is currently expected to occur in early June 2020.  
 In Oman, the Local Siemens Energy Business is conducted with the involvement of 
external third parties. It generated revenues of approximately EUR  23 million  in the fiscal 
year 2019. The Local Remaining Siemens Business in Oman was transferred economically 
(but not legally) to a newly formed company of the Future Siemens Group alre ady as of 
1 January 2020, as the necessary licenses  for a legal separation were not yet available. 
Since then, the local Future Siemens Energy Group Company has been conducting the 
Local Remaining Siemens Business for the account of the newly formed compan y of the 
Future Siemens Group. Execution of the transfer in rem  of the shares in the former regional 
company (and Future Siemens Energy Group Company) to a Future Siemens Energy Group 
Company is expected to occur end of June 2020.  
 In the United Arab Emirat es, the Local Siemens Energy Business is conducted with the 
involvement of external third parties. It generated revenues of approximately EUR  397 
million  in the fiscal year 2019. The transfer was executed in May 2020.  
 Participation in Siemens Ltd., India  
 
The transfer of the minority share of 24 % in S Ltd, India, which among other things operates the 
local S iemens  gas and power business in India (as described in more detail in Chapter  III.2.c) ) (for 
more information regarding  the planned minority share holding of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group  in Siemens  Ltd, India, see Chapter  III.2.c) ) could only be effected after 31 March 2020, but 
before 22 May 2020.  
The transfer of the shares in Siemens Ltd, India, was processed via an Indian stock exchange. 
Siemens AG  and a future Siemens Energy Group company had concluded a binding framework 
agreement on March 30, 2020 . For the acquisition of the shares in Siemens Ltd, India, Siemens AG 
had already paid a purchase price determined on the basis of the value of the shar es in Siemens Ltd, 
India, prior to the conclusion of the framework agreement with Siemens Energy KG (see 
Chapter  V.1.d) ) and has also made a promise of contribution together with SBI GmbH to the effect 
that any additional purchase price will be paid into S iemens Energy KG at a later date.  Based on 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  84 the executed sale and transfer, the amount for the contribution of the additional purchase price  is 
approximately EUR 50 million . 
 Economic Effects of a Delay in the Transfers  
The managing boards of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG believe that the delayed transfers 
as described above under aa) and bb) will only have limited economic relevance for the Future 
Siemens Energy Group and the Future Siemens Group ; cf. with regard to India under cc) . In 
determining the respective fixed or preliminary purchase prices for the respective carve -outs (as 
described above under aa) and bb)), the expected changes in value (in particular expected profits 
and losses) for the period between 1  April 2020 and the expected execution d ate of the Local Carve -
out were taken into account by determining the value  of the business  (value of equity) on the 
expected execution date of the respective Local Carve -out (LATA and  /or LSTA). Siemens AG has 
made a corresponding purchase price contribut ion to Siemens Energy KG (with regard to 
capitalization, see Section V.1.d)). In the case of purchase prices  with adjustment mechanism , 
however, minor changes may occur if the forecasted preliminary purchase price and the actual 
purchase price after execut ion of the respective Local Carve -out differ.  
In some countries, (slightly) different concepts have been agreed upon. In Oman, in which a reverse 
carve -out takes place, the local entity permanently attributable  to the Future Siemens Energy Group 
reimburse s a company of the Future Siemens Group for profits that the local entity has earned with 
the Local Remaining Siemens Business between 1  January and the execution of the reverse carve -
out. In Bangladesh, where the execution of the reverse carve -out is only  expected in December 
2020, the purchase price for the shares in the local entity is determined as of the local closing date 
in accordance with the requirements of local law on the basis of an external enterprise  valuation.  
According to the current plannin g, the cases of delay as described in this Chapter  V.1.e) – except 
for Bangladesh – could be completed prior to the Spin -off taking effect.  
Countries in which the transfer of the Local Siemens Energy Business to Future Siemens Energy 
Group Companies is not  to be effected in the long er term are described in Chapter  III.2.c); on joint 
ventures see also Chapter  V.1.f).  
 Joint Ventures  
In the past, Siemens AG and its subsidiaries have established joint ventures with several partners , 
which are conducting busines s activities related to the Siemens Energy Business. Pursuant to some 
of the agreements concluded with the joint venture  partners, any legal and/or economic transfer of 
the participations in the joint venture is subject to the consent of the relevant partn er. In most of the 
cases, Siemens AG or the relevant companies of the Siemens Group have obtained the consent of 
the respective partner to a permanent transfer of the participation of the Siemens Group in the joint 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  85 ventures to the Future Siemens Energy Gro up beyond the point in time when the Spin -off takes 
effect. This does not apply in the following cases:  
 RWG (Repair&Overhauls) Limited , Aberdeen, United Kingdom: The Siemens Group 
holds a participation of 50  % in the joint venture which is consolidated at equity . The 
necessary information for the legal transfer consent of the co -shareholder has not yet been 
obtained; as long as this is not granted, the Future Siemens Group will continue to hold the 
participation economically for and on behalf of the Future Siemens Energy Group. If no 
agreement is reached with the joint venture partner on the legal transfer of the participation 
to the Future Siemens Energy Group, economic ownership may be transferred back to the 
Future Siemens Group. Such retransfer would tak e place at fair market value.  
 Maschinenfabrik Reinhausen GmbH , Regensburg, Germany: The Siemens Group holds a 
participation of 20  % in this company; the participation is consolidated at equity . The 
consent of the shareholders' meeting required for the lega l transfer was not granted yet ; as 
long as this consent is not granted, for the time being, the Future Siemens Group will hold 
the participation economically on behalf and for the account of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group.  
 Infineon Technologies Bipolar Gm bH & Co. KG , Warstein, Germany: The Siemens Group 
holds a participation of 40  % in this company; the participation is consolidated at equity . 
The legal and economic transfer to Future Siemens Energy Group Companies has occurred. 
However, prior to the Spin -off taking effect a further consent of the joint venture partner is 
required. If this further consent is not granted, there can be an obligation to transfer the 
participation back legally and economically to the Future Siemens Group. This transfer 
from the  Future Siemens Energy Group to the Future Siemens Group would take place at 
fair market  value.  
 Shanghai Electric Power Generation Equipment Co. LTD ., Shanghai, China: The Siemens 
Group holds a participation of 40% in the joint venture; the joint venture i s consolidated at 
equity . Siemens AG and a Future Siemens Energy Group Company have agreed that the 
Future Siemens Energy Group shall  acquire the participation in the fiscal year 2021 
(subject to the consent of the joint venture partner). The transfer depe nds on the consent of 
the joint venture partner that shall  be requested after the Spin -off has taken effect. 
According to the existing shareholder agreement, the joint venture partner is entitled to a 
preemptive purchase right, which means that the transfe r of the participation in the joint 
venture to the Future Siemens Energy Group is not secured. The expected purchase price 
for the participation was contributed in advance to the future Siemens Energy Group in 
cash. Should the joint venture partner exercis e its preemptive purchase right, the Future 
Siemens Energy Group would retain the contribution already made by Siemens AG up to 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  86 the amount of the purchase price to be paid by the joint venture partner; the purchase price 
itself would accrue to the Future S iemens Group for reasons  of local law . 
2. Further Strengthening of Equity  
On 28 April 2020, Siemens AG and SBI GmbH agreed to make a further contribution of EUR  141 
million  pro rata  to their interest in the fixed capital of Siemens Energy KG to further strengthen 
the equity and liquidity of the Future Siemens Energy Group. The fixed capital was not increased 
in this connection; the amounts paid were booked  into the joint specific -purpose reserve account 
(gesamthänderisch gebundenes Rücklagenkonto ). At the same time, Siemens AG and SBI GmbH 
have committed  further cash for the acquisition of a part of an operation  (Betriebsteil ) in the area 
of operative project logistics towards  Siemens  Energy KG in accordance with their participation in 
the fixed capital  (see Chapter  V.4). The amount committed is equal to the purchase price for that 
part of operation, provided the amount is positive.  It is expected that these additional cash funds 
will not significantly exceed an amount in the single -digit million Euro range.  
3. Finan cing / Treasury  
With the exception of SGRE, the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies will generally 
participate indirectly or directly in group financing of the Siemens Group up until the Spin -off 
taking effect . However, in  the course of the Carve -out, a central treasury department has been 
established for the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies at the Siemens Energy KG level. To 
the extent permitted by law and with the exception of SGRE, the Future Siemens Energy Group 
Compan ies shall directly or indirectly have access to the internal financing and guarantee lines of 
the Siemens Group through Siemens Energy KG until the Spin -off takes effect. Positive and 
negative financing balances of the individual Future Siemens Energy Grou p Companies are 
consolidated at the level of Siemens Energy KG. The resulting total balance will be financed or 
invested by Siemens Energy KG within the general  group financing of Siemens Group. This will 
ease the future separation of the group financing o f the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies 
from that of the Future Siemens Group upon the Spin -off taking effect . 
 Financing  
To the extent legally permitted and with the exception of SGRE, currently the Future Siemens 
Energy Group Companies are generally s till indirectly connected to the financing of the Siemens 
Group through the clearing accounts of Siemens Energy KG with Siemens AG and through mostly 
short term loans and investments.  
The existing financial liabilities vis-à-vis the Future Siemens Group Co mpanies (as regards 
guarantees and securities see Chapter  V.3.d) below) will be settled  by the Future Siemens Energy 
Group Companies and, if necessary, replaced  through external financing in connection with the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  87 completion of the Spin -off. The existing fina ncial claims  vis-à-vis Future Siemens Group 
Companies will be mostly settled  in connection with the Spin -off taking effect .  
Even prior to the Spin -off taking effect, a syndicated credit agreement shall be concluded with an 
international banking syndicate.  A consortium consisting of several banks committed to this in a 
commitment letter to Siemens Energy KG in May 2020. The bank consortium is expected to place 
credit tranches with further banks before the Spin -off takes effect (syndication). The credit 
agreement will include a revolving credit line of EUR  3 billion  which can also be drawn in US 
dollars and British pounds. The credit line will have a term of at least three years and will be used 
for general corporate financing needs, i.e. in particular for fi nancing the operating business. 
Standard market conditions have been agreed  on. It is t he purpose of determining the amount and 
term of credit lines to ensure that the Future Siemens Energy Group has sufficient funds  and 
flexibility in the medium term in line with its business planning.   
In addition, SGRE will continue to finance itself through independent credit arrangements . 
 Cash Management  
The participation of Siemens Energy KG, and through this the indirect participation of the Future 
Siemens Energy Gr oup, in the cash management (including any participation in cash pooling) of 
the Siemens Group will terminate in connection with the Spin -off taking effect and be essentially  
replaced through internal programs of the Future Siemens Energy Group. In prepara tion for this , a 
distinct cash management system with internal clearing accounts with the Future Siemens Energy 
Group Companies (with the exception of SGRE) is introduced at the level of Siemens Energy KG, 
through which, inter alia , trade receivables and t rade payables  as well as cash management 
transactions within the Future Siemens Energy Group can be settled (a so -called "clearing star" 
(Verrechnungsstern) ). As of 1  January 2020, Siemens Energy KG has been joined to the clearing 
star of the Siemens Group , while its subsidiaries form a clearing star exclusively with Siemens 
Energy KG.  
Siemens Energy KG itself will  initially  continue to participate in the central clearing star of the 
Future Siemens Group. This participation will terminate in connection with  the Spin -off taking 
effect . Independently, the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies are also still directly using 
certain other aspects of the cash management system of the Siemens Group. This will also cease in 
connection with the Spin -off taking effect . 
The clearing process established between SGRE S.A. and Siemens AG for monthly invoicing and 
settlement of trade receivables and trade payables between the Siemens Group and SGRE S.A. will 
also be terminated in connection with the spin -off taking effect a nd the balances will be settled in 
accordance with the underlying agreement.

Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  88 
 Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Hedging Derivatives  
Furthermore, to the extent permitted by law, Future Siemens Energy Group Companies have 
entered into and continue t o enter into  currency, interest and commodity price hedging transactions 
with Future Siemens Group Companies.  
The currency, interest and commodity price hedging transactions  which the Future Siemens Energy 
Group Companies have entered into with Future Siemens Group Companies shall be terminated or 
novated in connection with the Spin -off taking effect . In the case of termination, the calculated 
market value of the derivate will be paid from the respective Future Siemens Group Company to 
the respective Fu ture Siemens Energy Group Company, or vice versa . Alternatively, the market 
value transfer payment can also occur centrally between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG and 
may be passed on  by them to their respective subsidiaries. In the alternative of novati ng a derivate, 
an existing hedging transaction between a Future Siemens Group Company and a Future Siemens 
Energy Group Company is (i)  transferred to an external trading partner in connection with the 
compensation of the market value of the derivate and th e Future Siemens Group Company is 
replaced by such trading partner, or (ii)  one or more external trading partners are intermediated 
between a Future Siemens Energy Group Company and a Future Siemens Group Company. In this 
case,  no market value compensation  is necessary. In both cases, the Future Siemens Energy Group 
Company possibly has to accept inferior  terms and conditions.  
The Future Siemens Energy Group Companies and the Future Siemens Group Companies may 
enter into agreements deviating from the above procedure. In particular, it may be agreed that 
certain currency transactions that expire in the period up to twelve months after the Spin -off takes 
effect will not be terminated or novated.  
The Future Siemens Energy Group will enter into framework agreeme nts with banks, in which 
currency, interest and commodity price hedging transactions can be newly executed. However, this 
will possibly not happen with regard to all currency pairs and durations . The Future Siemens Energy 
Group will enter into currency, in terest, and commodity price hedging arrangements with the banks , 
which are potentially on less favorable terms than those , which were previously available  with or 
for the Siemens Group Companies.  
To the extent that Future Siemens Energy Group Companies hav e so far  directly entered into 
currency, interest and commodity price hedging arrangements with banks, these arrangement s will 
continue with the respective banks.  
The currency, interest and commodity price hedging agreements concluded between SGRE and 
Siem ens AG will also be terminated or novated at the latest when the Spin -off takes effect , unless 
contractual agreements deviating from the above procedure are made. In particular, it could be 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  89 agreed that certain currency transactions that expire in the perio d up to twelve months after the 
effective date of the Spin -off at the latest will not be terminated or novated (see Chapter  XI.6.i)).  
 Securities as well as Bank and Group Guarantees  
The issuance of guarantees, sureties and other securities for the obligations of Future Siemens 
Energy Group Companies will continue to occur until the Spin -off taking effect , principally through 
Siemens AG and certain other of the Future Siemens Group Companies as well as through 
guarantee lines of Siemens AG, other Fut ure Siemens Group Companies or Future Siemens Energy 
Group Companies with banks and insurance companies. At the same time, however, Siemens 
Energy KG is liable in its internal relationship with Siemens AG for contractual obligations of 
Future Siemens Energ y Group Companies to which the above -mentioned guarantees, sureties and 
other securities refer, jointly and severally with the respective Future Siemens Energy Group 
Company. This applies to the following guarantees, sureties and other securities:  
 Siemens AG has issued patronages and other guarantees for local credit lines, currency, 
interest and commodity price hedging transactions and guarantee lines of Future Siemens 
Energy Group Companies (with the exception of SGRE) for the benefit of banks, insurance 
companies and other financial institutions. As of 31  March 2020, there were credit and 
guarantee lines as well as currency, interest and commodity price hedging transactions in 
the amount of approximately EUR  5.5 billion  that were secured through the patro nage and 
other securities by Siemens AG. Not included in this amount are securities and currency, 
interest and commodity price hedging activities , which were requested by Future Siemens 
Energy Group Companies through Future Siemens Group Companies. In indi vidual cases, 
the provision of securit ies occurs through other Future Siemens Group Companies.  
 Moreover, Future Siemens Group Companies, or their commissioned banks and insurance 
companies, have issued or commissioned in some cases long -term worldwide guar antees, 
sureties and other securities to suppliers, customers and business partners of the Future 
Siemens Energy Group Companies to the effect that  the Future Siemens Energy Group 
Companies will fulfill their contractual obligations. These were for the ben efit of Future 
Siemens Energy Group Companies (with the exception of SGRE) and, as of 31  March 2020 
in the amount of approximately EUR  24.8 billion . This volume was calculated on the 
assumption that as liability amount in the case of ancillary parent compa ny guarantees 
(guarantees by S iemens  AG or another Future S iemens  Group company to secure the 
performance obligations of Future Siemens Energy Group companies under supply or 
service contracts, in short  "PCG "), to the extent that these do not include a max imum 
liability amount, in general the value of the secured delivery or service agreement is 
recognized  for the duration of the agreement. After the Spin -off takes effect, when 
determining the liability amount of a PCG, the original value of the secured del ivery or 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  90 service agreement will be reduced linearly over the planned term of the delivery or service 
agreement and the calculation of the fees due for the provision of the PCG will be based 
on this reduction, unless there are reasons for a different risk a ssessment and an increased 
liability amount (" Risk -adequate Liability Amount "). 
 Even after completion of the Carve -out of the Siemens Energy Business , the Future 
Siemens Group Companies will be generally available for the issuance and commissioning 
of guarantees, sureties and other securities in connection with the Siemens Energy Business 
until the Spin -off taking effect.  
The above -mentioned guarantees,  sureties and other securities shall be replaced by own guarantees, 
sureties and other securities of the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies when the Spin -off 
takes effect. Until such time as the guarantees, sureties and securities have been replaced, Si emens 
Energy KG shall (for the first time six months after the spin -off takes effect) report quarterly to 
Siemens AG on the steps taken to achieve such replacement of the guarantees and securities. The 
following measures are planned to achieve the replacem ent: 
 Future Siemens Energy Group Companies will agree with banks and insurance companies 
on their own lines for the provision of guarantees, sureties or other securities. These are 
initially secured by a patronage or other security provided by Siemens AG o r other Future 
Siemens Group Companies; after the Spin -off takes effect, these will be replaced by a 
patronage or other securities of Siemens Energy AG.  
 Furthermore, it is planned to transfer at a later date the guarantees, sureties or other 
securities iss ued for the Siemens Energy Business on the lines of the Future Siemens Group 
Companies at banks and insurance companies to the lines of the Future Siemens Energy 
Companies at banks and insurance companies.  
 To the extent Future Siemens Group Companies have provided or will provide guarantees, 
sureties or other securities, they will try to agree with the beneficiaries, that the 
beneficiaries will, at a later time and under certain conditions, accept a replacement security 
from Siemens Energy AG or other Futur e Siemens Energy Group Companies and will 
discharge the Future Siemens Group Companies from liability.  
 Furthermore, the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies are generally obligated to seek 
the replacement of guarantees, warranties and other securities pro vided by Future Siemens 
Group Companies.  
Since the discharge of guarantees, sureties and other securities usually requires the consent of the 
respective beneficiary, it can be assumed that a large part of the portfolio will continue to exist after 
the Spin -off takes effect until the end of the term of the secured liabilities.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  91 To the extent that Future Siemens Energy Group Companies have issued guarantees, sureties or 
other securities for the benefit of the remaining Siemens business (this is the case for t he reverse 
carve -out; in this regard, see Chapter  V.1c)), it is planned that Siemens AG or other Future Siemens 
Group Companies will discharge these securities and guarantees or will issue replacement 
securities. This discharge also normally requires the c onsent of the beneficiar ies. 
Moreover, Future Siemens Group Companies have concluded agency agreements with SGRE for 
the provision of direct and indirect guarantees, sureties and other securities. The volume of these 
securities amounted to approximately EU R 20.2 billion  as of 31  March 2020  (please see above 
regarding the calculation for the PCG) . For these  SGRE  still pays guarantee commissions to the 
Future Siemens Group Companies and is liable for all expenses, costs and in particular for the 
fulfillment o f payment obligations under the issued  instruments. As part of the Carve -out, Siemens 
Energy KG has assumed the obligation in the internal relationship with Siemens AG for guarantees, 
sureties and other securities in favor of SGRE to seek for a discharge. At the same time , Siemens 
Energy KG has assumed joint and several liability and is , therefore, liable to Siemens AG in this 
respect for SGRE's payment obligations, in particular for payment of the guarantee fees due, 
expenses and other costs.  
 Forfaiting, F actoring  
Certain Future Siemens Energy Group Companies have sold in the past and still sell trade and other 
receivables with the corresponding del credere  risk ( Delkredererisiko ) to Future Siemens Group 
Companies , whereby the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies possibly remain responsible 
for the administration, and especially for the payment of the receivables . The sale of receivables  
serves as a preliminary financing of the Future Siemens Energy Group Companie s. This kind of 
preliminary financing shall either continue or otherwise cease following the completion of the Spin -
off on a case-by-case basis and as legally permitted.  
 Supply Chain Finance  
In the past, c ertain Future Siemens Energy Group Companies and so me of their suppliers have 
participated in programs for the financing of the supplier chain (Supply Chain Finance Program – 
"SCFP "). These SCFP are offered and operated by third party providers. With respect to the SCFP, 
Siemens AG and other Future Siemens  Group Companies have assumed joint and several liability 
vis-à-vis the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies ' obligations to the third party providers. It 
is planned to terminate the participation of the Future Siemens Energy Group in the SCFP secured 
by Siemens before the Spin -off takes effect and to replace it by a separate Energy SCFP (without 
liability of Future Siemens Group Companies).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  92 
 Financial Leasing  
Certain Future Siemens Energy Group Companies have in the past entered into and continue to 
enter into financial leasing agreements (as well as operating lease agreements) with Future Siemens 
Group Companies. The financial leasing agreements assist in the financing of Future Siemens 
Energy Group Companies, which act as lessees. The subject of the finance lease agreements are 
movable assets, in particular various logistics, production and office equipment. The leasing 
agreements will continue  until their con tractual end date.  
4. Transfer of Employees  
The transfer of employees to the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies is occurring in several 
steps. The employment relationships of the individual employees as well as their rights and 
entitlements and vested interests will in principle be transferred unchanged to the respective Future 
Siemens Energy Group Company.  
 The vast majority of the employees responsible for the Siemens Gas and Power Business 
have transferred to the respective Future Siemens Energy Group  Companies as part of the 
various Local Carve -outs. In Germany, approximately 26,000 employees have transferred 
from Siemens AG to Siemens Energy KG with effect as of 1  January 2020 through a 
transfer of business ( Betriebsübergang ) pursuant to Section  613a  BGB (in this regard, see 
also Chapter  V.1.b). In other jurisdictions, the employee transfers have occurred according 
to and in compliance with the local employment laws and frameworks.  
 Employees in central functions of the Siemens Group, who were initiall y indispensable to 
Siemens AG for certain activities and projects, have not already transferred to Siemens 
Energy KG with the Carve -out having taken place in Germany as of 1  January 2020, but 
will only be transferred to Siemens Energy KG as of 1  August 202 0. This applies in 
particular to the units  Siemens Operations IT as well as  Controlling and Finance - 
Accounting, Reporting and Controlling. Furthermore, as of 1  August 2020 an operating 
unit ( Betriebsteil ) from the operating company Digital Industries was  transferred to 
Siemens Energy KG. The transfers are mainly made on the basis of (further) transfers of 
business in accordance with Section  613a BGB. The agreements on which the transfers are 
based have already been concluded between Siemens AG and Siemens  Energy KG. 
Transferring employees who are not part of the transferring business units above will be 
transferred through individual agreements. In total, as of 1  August 2020, approximately 
another 170 employees will be transferred to the Future Siemens Ene rgy Group.  
 In addition, an operating unit in the area of operational project logistics  with approximately 
60 employees , who have  initially been transferred to Siemens Energy KG as part of the 
Carve -out, is expected to be transferred back to Siemens AG as o f 1 August 2020 on the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  93 basis of a transfer of business pursuant to Section  613a BGB and operational project 
logistics will in future be provided as a service to the Future Siemens Energy Group. The 
contractual agreement underlying this transfer has already  been concluded between 
Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG.  
 Finally, several Future Siemens Energy Group Companies have undertaken to take over a 
certain number of employees from Future Siemens Group Companies upon termination of 
certain service agreements. The relevant service agreements will, to a certain extent, only 
be terminated after several years in time.  About 100 jobs on group level will be affected, 
of which approximately 30 are in Germany. It is not yet clear which specific employees 
will transfer and whether the transfer will be made by means of individual agreement or by 
transfer of business in accordance with Section  613a BGB.  
5. Pensions  
Siemens AG and various Future Siemens Group Companies have made pension commitments  to 
employees  in the past , in particular to current and former employees of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group (" Energy Employees "). These commitments  result in pension obligations that were 
allocated to either the Future Siemens Energy Group or the Future Siemens Group as part of the 
Carve-out. Pension assets are generally allocated in the amount of the relevant IFRS funding ratio 
of the related pension obligation in  the Siemens Group in accordance with local provisions. The 
following paragraphs provide details on the countries (Germany,  United States, Canada and United 
Kingdom) with the most significant pension obligations.  
The pension obligations vis-à-vis active Energy Employees in Germany were transferred to 
Siemens Energy  KG in accordance with Section  613a BGB as part of the transfer  of the German 
Siemens Energy Business Operations. In connection with the transfer of the pension obligations, 
Siemens  AG has transferred (by means of a so -called Contractual Trust Arrangement ) assets in the 
amount of EUR  1,015  million  (as of 1  January 202 0) to the new pension trustee of the Future 
Siemens Energy Group Companies in Germany. Pension obligations vis-à-vis Energy Employees 
who had already left before 1  January 2020 have remained at Siemens  AG. 
In addition, other Future Siemens Group Companies in the United States, Canada and the United 
Kingdom have also made pension entitlements to Energy Employees by means of defined benefit 
and defined contribution plans (" Pension Plans "). To the extent that the Pension Plans exclusively 
affect current or for mer Energy Employees, they have been or will be transferred to the 
responsibility of the Future Siemens Energy Group.  Apart from that, Pension Plans that do not 
exclusively concern active or former Energy Employees, will be divided; assets for pension clai ms 
of Energy Employees will be transferred to the new Pension Plans for Energy Employees in 
accordance with the respective legal provisions. In the United Kingdom, by contrast, a division of 
the Siemens Benefit Schemes ( leistungsorientierter Pensionsplan ) will not occur; the existing 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  94 pension obligations vis-à-vis Energy Employees and related pension plan assets will remain in the 
Future Siemens Group.  
In total, the Future Siemens Energy Group has taken over pension obligations in the gross amount 
of EUR  3,151 million  as of 31  March 2020 (evaluation under IFRS). After netting with pension 
plan assets, accruals for pensions and other obligations for EUR  1,037  million  remain as of 
31 March 2020.  
6. Insurance  
The Future Siemens Energy Group Companies (except SGRE) will continue to participate in the 
global insurance programs of the Future Siemens Group (especially Construction, Property, 
Liability, Marine and Cyber Insurance) until 30  September  2021. Only the d irectors' and officers' 
liability insurance (so -called D&O  Insurance) and the other financial lines programs (Employment 
Practice Liability, Crime Insurance and Criminal Legal Defense Cost Insurance) will, in contrast, 
be replaced by independent  Siemens En ergy policies when the Spin -off takes effect at the latest.  
7. Service Agreements  
Currently, various Future Siemens Group Companies provide services for the Siemens Energy 
Business vis-à-vis certain Future Siemens Energy Group Companies. These internal servic e 
agreements will end at the latest upon a loss of control by Siemens AG over the relevant Future 
Siemens Energy Group Companies (cf. Chapter  VI.12 and Chapter  XIII.3) (" Loss of Control ") and 
will be partially replaced by service agreements for a transitio nal period. Under the service 
agreements concluded for a transitional period, various Future Siemens Group Companies will 
provide certain services to Future Siemens Energy Group Companies for a period of usually 
twelve  months to 36  months from the Loss of Control. There will also be longer -term service 
agreements between various Future Siemens Group Companies and Future Siemens Energy Group 
Companies.  
For details regarding  these service agreements, see Chapter  XI.4.  
8. Designation "Siemens"  
The rights relating  to the umbrella trademark "Siemens" and other trademarks with the component 
"Siemens" are held by Siemens Trademark GmbH  & Co. KG. Siemens  AG is entitled to administer 
and to further license the use of the trademark (also in combination with other tradema rk 
components). The rights relating to the name "Siemens" are held directly by Siemens  AG. 
On 1  January 2020, Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  KG entered into an intra -group trademark 
licensing agreement under which Siemens Energy KG and its affiliates are en titled to use the name 
and trademark "Siemens" for as long as they remain members of the Siemens Group. In the event 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  95 of a Loss of Control, this trademark licensing agreement will be replaced by a new trademark 
licensing agreement, which will be explained i n more detail in Chapter  XI.3.  
9. Taxes  
In the course of bundling the Siemens Energy Business under Siemens Energy KG, assets of 
Siemens AG and SBI GmbH were contributed to Siemens Energy KG. Some of these contributions 
are to be made at book value for tax purposes. To this extent, Siemens Energ y KG and Siemens 
Energy AG have undertaken to submit the corresponding applications for the carryover of the book 
values. Moreover, the participation in Siemens Energy KG has been contributed  to SBI GmbH  with 
book values carried over, which resulted in taxable holding periods ( steuerliche Haltefristen ) (so-
called shares subject to a blocking period ( sperrfristbehaftete Anteile )); in the event that these 
holding periods are violated, this may result in indemnification and compensation claims in the 
relati onship between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG under the Group Separation 
Agreement, which is attached to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement as Annex  20 (see also 
Chapter  VIII.2.g)).   
Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  KG have agreed on a comprehensive cooper ation in tax matters 
concerning also the period prior to and after the bundling of the Siemens Energy Business under 
Siemens Energy KG.  
10. Joint Contracts with Third Parties  
Prior to the implementation of the Carve -out, there were joint contracts between Futu re Siemens 
Group Companies and Future Siemens Energy Group Companies with third parties, particularly in 
the areas of procurement and logistics (including the areas direct materials ( e.g. semi -finished 
products ( Halbzeuge )) and indirect materials ( e.g. logistic, IT)).  
Insofar as  only parts of these contracts with third parties relate to the Siemens Energy Business and 
have therefore not been transferred to Siemens Energy  KG as part of the Carve -out of the Siemens 
Energy Business, they will be divided into s eparate contracts between the Future Siemens Group 
and the Future Siemens Energy Group as far as possible until the Spin -off takes effect. In case  
contracts cannot be divided, for example because the division requires the consent of a third party, 
the resp ective group companies will , to the extent permitted by law,  act internally as if the contract 
had been divided. Partly, it is intended not to divide contracts with third parties into separate 
contracts. This concerns in particular such framework supply ag reements, under which Future 
Siemens Energy Group Companies are entitled to place delivery orders also after the Spin -off takes 
effect. In these cases, the respective group companies will also act internally as if the division of 
the contract had occurred.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  96 Procurement contracts were mostly kept in companies of the Future Siemens Group, however, 
Future Siemens Energy Group Companies were included into the scope of the contracts so that they 
can continue to use the contracts.  
In some cases, it has been agreed  to transfer contracts as a whole to the respective Future Siemens 
Energy Group Company. In this case, the respective group companies act internally as if the part 
of the contract that does not concern the Siemens Energy Business would have been transferre d to 
the Future Siemens Group Company.  
11. IT 
The IT infrastructure of the Siemens Energy Business has been part of the IT infrastructure of the 
Siemens Group prior to the decision to legally separate the Siemens Energy Business. Applications 
and an IT infrast ructure that until now have been obtained under the roof of the Siemens Group 
will be re -built within the Future Siemens Energy Group independently from the Future Siemens 
Group. This process is expected to be completed by 2023 and will be supported by ser vices of the 
Future Siemens Group under Transitional Service Agreements ( cf. Chapter  XI.4). 
In the past, the Siemens Energy Business has used software ( e.g. SAP, Microsoft, Oracle) mainly 
under the scope of group framework agreements of the Siemens Group. The individual software 
licenses under the group framework agreements, which were exclusively allocated to the Siemens 
Energy Business until the Carve -out, were transferred to the respective Future Siemens Energy 
Group Company when the respective Local Carve -out became effective. Siemens AG and Siemens 
Energy KG have agreed that the respective Future Siemens Energy Group Companies shall seek 
the approval of the respective licensor for the transfer until the Spin -off takes effect and, if 
necessary, conclude their own license and  / or maintenance agreements with the respective 
providers under possibly modified terms and conditions.  
It is planned that the Futur e Siemens Energy Group Companies will, in the future, conclude their 
own licensing and maintenance agreements with the software suppliers to the extent possible and 
build procurement alliances with the Future Siemens Group where possible and reasonable.  
12. Public-law Permits  
The public -law permits required for the operation of the Siemens Energy Business have been 
transferred to the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies, as far as legally permissible, or were 
re-applied for as part of the Carve -out. In Germany , purely land related approvals 
(Sachgenehmigungen ) such as building permits ( Baugenehmigungen ) or facility -related permits 
(anlagenbezogene Genehmigungen ) under the Federal Immission Control Act ( Bundes -
Immissionsschutzgesetz , BImSchG) have been transferr ed to Siemens Energy  KG to the extent that 
Siemens Energy  KG became the facility operator ( Anlagenbetreiber ) within the statutory meaning 
after the Carve -out. Apart from that, re -approvals or transfer permits respectively have been or will 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  97 be applied for. The Future Siemens Energy Group Companies will also independently re -apply for 
export licenses and customs permits as well as non -transferrable permits or permits other than those 
concerning only the Siemens Energy Business, if they have not already done s o. Overall, it has 
been ensured for every Future Siemens Energy Group Company as part of the Carve -out that any 
permits that are absolutely necessary for the operation of the business are available before the 
execution of each legal separation or that an a lternative solution that is economically feasible exists.  
In individual cases, however, certain acceptable restrictions or impediments to the business 
activities of the Siemens  Energy B usiness may still temporarily arise due to the lack of public law 
permi ts. 
13. State Aid  
Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  KG have agreed on a mutual indemnification, if one of the two 
companies or one if its affiliated companies is ordered in a non -appealable manner to repay state 
aid granted prior to the Spin -off taking effect as a  result of an act or omission of the respective other 
company or one of its affiliated companies.  
14. Costs of the Carve -out 
The costs of the Carve -out and its execution consist of external one -time costs and taxes. Only part 
of these costs have already been incurred by 31  March 2020 and are in this respect only partly 
included in the financial figures as of 31  March 2020. The t otal cost of the Carve -out is currently 
expected to be in the mid three -digit million Euro range. It is expected that the vast majority of this 
amount will be attributable to the Future Siemens Group Companies.  
In the agreements on which the Carve -out is b ased, it has been regularly agreed that the party 
obliged to bear  the tax is the party who is liable to pay the tax in question under the applicable tax 
law. In the case of transfer taxes ( Verkehrssteuern ), where under applicable law both parties are 
liable to pay tax, the respective transferor typically bears the taxes incurred. With regard to other 
costs, such as the costs of notarization of an agreement, it is generally agreed that the involved 
company of the Future Siemens Group will bear these costs.  
  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  98 VI. Legal Implementation of the Spin -off  
1. Overview  
Siemens AG intends to not completely dispose of its participation in Siemens Energy AG . It will 
initially remain a non -controlling anchor shareholder in Siemens Energy  AG with a 35.1  % 
shareholding directly and indirectly via SBI  GmbH . Additionally, the Siemens Pension Trust  e.V. 
will hold a 9.9  % stake in Siemens Energy  AG. With the strategic and operational development of 
Siemens Energy  AG and Siemens  AG, Siemens  AG intends to reduce its stake in Siemens 
Energy  AG significantly in a timeframe of twelve to 18 months after the Spin -off taking effect.   
The transfer of the Siemens Energy Business that has been bundled  in and under Siemens Energy 
KG will be implemented in two steps. The first step serves to create Siemens AG's and SBI  GmbH's 
participation in Siemens Energy AG , which will  remain after the S pin-off takes effect. With the 
Spin-off implemented in a second step, the Siemens Shareholders will be granted a participation in 
Siemens Energy AG.  
First, the participation held by SBI  GmbH in Siemens Energy KG and a portion of the participation 
held by S iemens  AG in Siemens Energy KG as well as corresponding participations held in the 
General Partner GmbH will be contributed to Siemens Energy  AG by way of Capital Increases in 
Kind. SBI GmbH and Siemens AG will each receive shares in Siemens Energy AG crea ted by way 
of the capital increase  in return , ensuring value congruence between the shares being issued and 
the contribution. A resolution to this effect will be adopted by the shareholders' meeting of Siemens 
Energy AG in May 2020. After registration of t he implementation of the Capital Increases in Kind, 
Siemens AG will temporarily hold a participation of 73. 30 % in Siemens Energy AG; the remaining 
approximately 26.7 0 % will be held by SBI GmbH. The ownership structure following the entering 
of the Capita l Increases in Kind into the register of companies are visualized by the following chart 
(the chart does not depict the General Partner GmbH):  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  99  
In a second step, Siemens AG will spin off its remaining limited partnership interest in Siemens 
Energy KG and its remaining shares in the General Partner GmbH to Siemens Energy AG by way 
of a spin -off for absorption under the UmwG.  
As consideration for the Spin -off of the Spin -off Assets, the Siemens Shareholders will receive 
Siemens Energy shares pursuant to Sect ion 123 (2) UmwG corresponding to their participation in 
Siemens AG. The shares required for this purpose will be created by an additional capital increase 
in exchange for a contribution in kind of Siemens Energy AG. A corresponding resolution will be 
adop ted by the shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG in May 2020. After the 
implementation of the Spin -off, the Future Siemens Group will hold 45  % and the Siemens 
Shareholders will hold 55  % of the shares in Siemens Energy AG.  
Moreover, Siemens  AG will transfer shares in Siemens Energy AG amounting  to 9.9  % of the 
capital stock to SPT  e.V. in connection with the Spin -off.  
The result of the Spin -off is shown in the following chart (which also takes into account the transfer 
of shares to SPT  e.V.; the chart does not depict the General Partner GmbH ):

2. The Transferring and Receiving Entities  
The entities involved in the Spin -off are Siemens  AG as the transferring entity and Siemens 
Energy  AG as the receiving entity.  
3. Capital Increas es in Kind in Order to create the Participation in Siemens Energy AG that 
remains with the Future Siemens Group  
In order to create the participation in Siemens Energy AG that will remain with Siemens AG and 
SBI GmbH upon the Spin -off taking effect, Siemens  AG will contribute a partial limited partnership 
interest, representing a pro rata  amount in the fixed capital of Siemens Energy KG of 
EUR  57,693,148.85, as well as 8,246 shares in the General Partner  GmbH, each corresponding to 
approximately  32.98  % of t he fixed capital and the share capital, respectively, to Siemens Energy 
AG with economic effect as of 1  April 2020, 0 .00 hours (" Contribution Effective Date "). SBI 
GmbH will likewise contribute its limited partnership interest, representing a pro rata  amou nt of 
the fixed capital of Siemens Energy KG of EUR  21,015,601 as well as 3,004 shares in the General 
Partner GmbH, each corresponding to approximately  12.02  % of the fixed capital and the share 
capital, respectively, to Siemens Energy AG with economic effect as of the Contribution Effective 
Date, whereby  value congruence between the shares being issued and the contribution is ensured.  

CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  101 In case the executi on of the respective contributions in accordance with the contribution agreement, 
which shall occur in connection with the Spin -off becoming effective, is not completed until the 
end of 31  October 2020, the Contribution Effective Dates shall be deemed to b e 1 October 2020, 
0.00 hours. In case the respective contributions do not become effective until 31  October of a 
following year, the respective Contribution Effective Date is further postponed by another year to 
1 October, 0 .00 hours  of that following year . 
On 22  May 2020, Siemens  AG and SBI GmbH on one side and Siemens Energy  AG on the other 
side entered into a notarized contribution agreement (Annex  0.5.3 to the Spin -Off and Transfer 
Agreement attached hereto as Annex; details on this agreement are set ou t in Chapter  XIII.2.). The 
contribution agreement provides that Siemens AG will receive, in exchange for its contribution, 
shares in Siemens Energy AG and a cash payment in the amount of EUR  175,746.41  (plus interest 
credited to bank accounts and intragrou p clearing accou nts of Siemens Energy AG from 1  April 
2020 up to and including the date of disbursement or minus interest debited during this period ) 
(referred to as a mixed contribution in kind ( gemischte Sacheinlage )). The distribution of cash by 
Siemens  Energy AG serves to achieve value congruence between the assets of Siemens Energy AG 
and the Spin -off Assets (in this regard, see Chapter  VII.). SBI GmbH will receive, in exchange for 
its contribution, shares in Siemens Energy  AG (without any additional c ash payment).  
The shares to be issued as consideration will in each case be created by way of a capital increase in 
kind. The shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG will adopt the corresponding resolutions 
still in May 2020 . According to that resolutio ns, Siemens Energy AG will increase its capital stock 
from EUR  100,000 by EUR  326,860,337  to EUR  326,990,337  by issuing 321,890,337  no-par value  
shares (registered shares) each representing a pro rata amount of the capital stock and an issue 
price of EUR  1.00 each, i.e., a total issue price of EUR  326,890,337. 239,582,401  of these shares 
will be issued to Siemens AG and 87,307,936  of these shares will be issued to SBI GmbH. The 
new shares will be subscribed by Siemens AG and SBI GmbH, respectively, and  will be entitled to 
participate in the profit starting on 1  October 2019 (subject to adjustment due to a deferral of the 
Contribution Effective Date as contractually provided for). They will be  issued at the lowest issue 
price (geringster Ausgabebetrag ) of EUR  1.00 per share, i.e. , without a premium ( agio). 
As regards the capital increase s in kind, a court -appointed auditor has to audit whether the value of 
the respective contribution in kind reaches the lowest issue price for the shares plus the cash 
paym ent granted in exchange for the contribution. Since Siemens Energy AG was commercially 
active for the first time less than two years prior to the intended implementation of the capital 
increase s in kind (also referred to as an economic incorporation ( wirts chaftliche Neugründung )), 
the provisions about post -formation acquisit ion under Section  52 AktG must also be complied with 
analogously. In particular, a court -appointed auditor has to audit whether the value of the respective 
contribution in kind reaches t he lowest issue price for the shares plus the cash payment granted for 
the contribution. Under a court order of the district court of Munich dated 4  March 2020, Ernst & 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  102 Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, was appointed as the single audi tor for 
the contribution in kind and the post -formation acquisition. Ernst & Young GmbH 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, makes  an audit report on the post -formation acquisition , 
as well as one audit report on the contribution in kind for each ca pital increase in kind and confirm s 
the required value. Prior to this the supervisory board of Siemens Energy AG will submit a post -
formation acquisition report in mutatis mutandis  application of Sections  52 (3), 32 (2) and (3) 
AktG. Subsequently, the shar eholders ' meeting of Siemens Energy AG will approve the 
contribution agreement as post -formation agreement.  
The registrations with the register of companies of Siemens Energy AG required for the 
implementation of the capital increases in kind will be effected prior to the Spin -off taking effect.  
4. Spin -off Assets  
The assets to be transferred by Siemens AG to Siemens Energy AG by way of the Spin -off consist 
of (i) a partial limited partnership interest representing a pro rata amount of the fixed capital o f 
Siemens Energy KG in the amount of EUR  96,199, 583.15 (corresponding to 55 % of the fixed 
capital of Siemens Energy KG) and (ii) 13,750 shares held by Siemens AG in the General Partner 
GmbH with serial numbers 1 through 13,750 (representing a pro rata  amount of the share capital 
of the General Partner GmbH of 55  %). 
5. Spin -Off under Section  123 (2) No.  1 UmwG (Spin -Off by Absorption)  
From a legal perspective, the Spin -off will be effected by way of a spin -off by absorption 
(Abspaltung zur Aufnahme ) pursuant to Section  123 (3) no.  1 UmwG. Pursuant to that provision, 
Siemens  AG, as the transferring entity, transfers parts of its assets in their entirety to Siemens 
Energ y AG as the receiving entity by  absorption. As consideration for the transfer of the Spin -off 
Assets, Siemens Energy  AG as the receiving entity grants to the shareholders of Siemens A G newly 
created Siemens Energy Shares. One Siemens Energy S hare will be granted in exchange for two 
Siemens Shares. In total, 399,654,856  no-par value  registered  Siem ens Energy S hares will be 
granted. Under the Spin -off, the shareholders of Siemens AG will thus receive 55  % of the capital 
stock of Siemens Energy AG as it exists after the completion of the Spin -off. 
6. Spin -off and Transfer Agreement  
On 22  May 2020, Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG entered into a notarized Spin -off and 
Transfer Agreement, which is to be presented for approval to the shareholders' meeting of 
Siemens  AG on 9 July 2020  and previously to the shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG. 
The agreement contains the mandatory information required for the Spin -off pursuant to 
Section  126 UmwG. This information includes, inter alia , provisions on determining the Spin -off 
Assets and the details about the transfer of the Spin -off Assets and the con sideration to be granted 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  103 in exchange therefor. The Spin -off and Transfer Agreement together with its Annexes is explained 
in Chapter  XIII.1.  
The Spin -off and Transfer Agreement will be submitted to the group works council 
(Konzernbetriebsrat ) and to the ge neral works council ( Gesamtbetriebsrat ) existing at Siemens AG 
(Section  126 (3) UmwG). Siemens Energy  AG does not have a works council, which means that 
no such submission is required.  
7. Spin -Off Effective Date, Fiscal Transfer Effective Date and Postponemen t of the Effective 
Dates  
For the purposes of the commercial statements of financial position the transfer of the Spin -off 
Assets will take place in the relationship between Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy AG with 
economic effect as of 1  April 2020, 0 .00 hours (the " Spin -off Effective Date "). Starting as of this 
point in time, the transactions relating to the Spin -off Assets are to be executed – for the purposes 
of the commercial statements of financial position – for the account of Siemens Energy AG in the 
relationship between Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy AG.  
The Spin -off Effective Date is to be distinguished from the legal effective date of the transfer of 
business units  to Siemens Energy KG and its subsidiaries in connection with the global Carve -out 
on the  one hand and the date on which the transfers and the other agreements concluded with 
Siemens Energy KG and its subsidiaries take economic effect on the other hand. As regards these 
transfers and agreements, the relevant effective dates are in some cases d ifferent from the Spin -off 
Effective Date (in this regard, see the details set out in Chapter  V.). 
The fiscal transfer effective date for the Spin -off is 31  March 2020, 24 .00 hours  (the " Fiscal 
Transfer Effective Date "; cf. for more information, Chapter  VIII.2.a)).  
If the Spin -off is not registered with the registers of companies of Siemens AG by the end of 
31 October 2020, the Spin -off Effective Date will be postponed to 1  October 2020, 0 .00 hours  and 
the Fiscal Transfer Ef fective Date will be postponed to 30  September 2020, 24 .00 hours . In the case 
of a further delay of the registration beyond 31  October of the following year, the relevant effective 
date will be postponed in each case by another year.  
The undertaking of Sie mens  AG to ensure that no withdrawal of profits and assets from Siemens 
Energy KG is made following the execution of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement remains 
effective irrespective of a potential postponement of the Spin -off Effective Date.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  104 8. Spin -Off Aud it and Spin -Off Audit Report  
The Spin -off stipulated in the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement must be audited pursuant to 
Section  125 sentence  1 in conjunction with Section  9 UmwG by an expert spin -off auditor selected 
and appointed by a court. Upon joint re quest of the managing board of Siemens AG and the 
managing board of Siemens Energy AG , which at the time was still named Kyros 52 
Aktiengesellschaft , the regional court ( Landgericht ) Munich  I selected and appointed Baker Tilly 
GmbH & Co. KG Wirtschaftsprüf ungsgesellschaft, Düsseldorf, as the joint expert spin -off auditor 
by decision of 22  January 2020 pursuant to Section  125 sentence  1 in conjunction with Section  10 
(1) UmwG. The spin -off auditor will prepare a written report about the result of the audit i n 
accordance with Section  125 sentence  1 in conjunction with Section  12 UmwG, which, like this 
Spin-off Report, will be publicly available from the date of publication of the notice calling the 
extraordinary shareholders ' meeting of Siemens AG on 9  July 20 20. 
9. Shareholders'  Meetings of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG  
The Spin -off and Transfer Agreement will take effect only if it is approved by the shareholders' 
meetings of Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy AG, in each case, with the majority of at least three 
quarters of the capital stock represented when adopting the resolution (Section  125 sentence  1 in 
conjunction with Sections  13 (1), 65  (1) UmwG). The Spin -off and Transfer Agreement will be 
submitted for approval to the extraordinary shareholders' meeting of Siemens  AG on 9  July 2020.  
Siemens  AG, acting as the sole shareholder of Siemens Energy AG, will grant its consent to the 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement at the shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG  in May 2020.  
10. Spin -off Capital Increase  for Implem entation of the Spin -Off; Audit of the Post -Formation 
Acquisition and of the Contributions in Kind  
In order to implement the Spin -off, Siemens Energy AG will increase its capital stock – after the 
Capital Increases in Kind (see Chapter  VI.3.) – from EUR  326,990,377  by EUR  399,654,856  to 
EUR  726,645,193  by issuing 399,654,856  shares of no-par value  (registered shares) (see §  10.3 of 
the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement). To the extent that the book value under commercial law 
(handelsrechtlicher Buchwert ) of the Spin -off Assets as of the Spin -off Effective Date exceeds the 
amount of EUR  399,654,856 , i.e., the amount of the increase in the capital stock of Siemens Energy 
AG, the excess amount will be booked to the capital reserve of Siemens Energy AG pursuant t o 
Section  272 (2) no.  1 HGB (see §  10.4 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement). The corresponding 
resolution on the capital increase will be adopted at the shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy 
AG together with the resolution approving the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement. The Spin -off 
cannot be registered until the implementation of the spin -off capital increase has been registered 
with the register of companies of Siemens Energy AG.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  105 In the context of the spin -off capital increase, an audit of the contri butions in kind will be conducted, 
specifically to determine whether the value of the contribution in kind reaches the lowest issue price 
for the shares granted in exchange therefor. Furthermore, an additional post -formation  acquisition  
audit will be condu cted owing to the fact that the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement is being 
concluded between Siemens Energy AG and its shareholder, namely Siemens AG, and two years 
have not yet passed since Siemens Energy AG started its commercial activities (also referred to as 
economic incorporation). On 4  March 2020, Ernst & Young GmbH 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, was appointed by the district court of Munich as the 
single auditor for the post -formation acquisition and the contribution in kind (see, with re gard to 
the post -formation acquisition audit, Section  125 sentence  1 in conjunction with Section  67 UmwG 
in conjunction with Sections  52 (4), 33 (3) to (5), 34 et seq q. AktG and, with regard to the 
contributions in kind, Section  125 sentence  1 in conjuncti on with Sections  142 (1), 69 (1) 
sentence  1 UmwG in conjunction with Sections  183 (3), 33 (3) to (5), 34 et seq q. AktG). The 
auditor of the post -formation acquisition and contribution in kind will prepare a report on the post -
formation  acquisition  audit an d a report on the impairment test of the contribution in kind. In 
addition, the supervisory board of Siemens Energy  AG will prepare a post -formation  acquisition  
report. The auditor's report about the audit of the contribution in kind will be submitted to a nd 
deposited with the register of companies of Siemens Energy AG at the district court of Munich 
(Section  142 (2) UmwG). The shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG must approve the 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement as post-formation acquisition  agreement . This approving 
resolution will be adopted together with the resolution of the shareholders' meeting of Siemens 
Energy AG on the approval of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement pursuant to the UmwG. The 
spin-off capital increase and the Spin -off cannot be  registered until the approval of the post -
formation acquisition has been registered with the register of companies of Siemens Energy AG.  
11. Filings and Registrations of the Spin -Off with the Register of Companies  
After the shareholde rs' meetings of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG have approved the Spin -
off, the managing board of Siemens AG and the managing board of Siemens Energy AG must file 
for registration of the Spin -off with the registers of companies (Sections  129, 125 sentence  1 in 
conjunction with Section  16 (1) UmwG). In addition, the managing board of Siemens Energy AG 
must apply for registration of the Capital Increases in Kind with the register of companies of 
Siemens Energy AG for t he purpose of implementing the c ontribut ion agreement (in this regard, 
see Chapter  XIII.2 ). The registrations of both  Capital Increases in Kind with the register of 
companies of Siemens Energy AG must  be effected prior to the Spin -off taking effect.  
The filing of the Spin -off with the registers of companies of Siemens AG must include statements 
of financial position of Siemens AG as closing statements of financial position (Section  125 
sentence  1 in conjunction with Section  17 (2) UmwG). The closing statements of financial position 
are the interim s tatements of financial position of Siemens AG prepared as of 31  March 2020, 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  106 24.00 hours , in accordance with the provisions on the annual statements of financial position and 
the audit thereof. They were audited by Ernst & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgese llschaft, 
Stuttgart, which was appointed in accordance with the legal requirements by resolution of the 
annual shareholders ' meeting of Siemens AG on 5  February 2020 as auditor for the closing 
statements of financial position required in connection with th e Spin -off under the UmwG . 
The Spin -off will not take effect until its registration with the registers of companies of Siemens 
AG at the district court of Charlottenburg and the district court of Munich, with the later of the two 
registration dates being d eterminative. Previously, the Spin -off must have been registered with the 
register of companies of Siemens Energy AG at the district court of Munich. According to the 
provisions of the UmwG, the Spin -off can only be registered after the implementation of t he Spin -
off Capital Increase has been registered with the register of companies of Siemens Energy AG 
(Sections  125 sentence  1, 66, 130 (1) sentence  1 UmwG). Upon the later of the registrations with 
the register of companies of Siemens AG at the district co urt of Charlottenburg or the district court 
of Munich, the Spin -off Assets will transfer to Siemens Energy AG in their entirety by force of law 
and by way of a partial universal succession in accordance with the scope set forth in the Spin -off 
and Transfer  Agreement. Pursuant to Section  10 HGB, the register courts will publish, in each case, 
the entry of the Spin -off into the register of companies as effected by them in the electronic 
information and communications system determined by the respective state justice administration 
(Landesjustizverwaltung ) (www.registerbekanntmachungen.de ). 
Assuming that no complaint is filed, or that no complaint is filed in a timely manner, against the 
validity of the approving resolution of the shareholders ' meeting of Sieme ns AG regarding the Spin -
off and Transfer Agreement, it is intended that the registration of the Spin -off will take place in 
September 2020 and that the Spin -off will then become effective prior to the end of Siemens  AG's 
fiscal year. Immediately thereafte r, admission of the Siemens Energy Shares to trading on the 
Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and in the sub -segment of the Regulated Market 
of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with additional post -admission obligations (Prime Standard) is to 
be applied for.  
If a complaint against the validity of the resolution on the Spin -off is filed in a timely manner, it 
will hinder, as a general rule and without regard to its prospects for success, the registration of the 
Spin-off with the register of companies and, thus, the coming into effect of the Spin -off, which 
means that a delay woul d occur . The reason for this is that the managing boards of Siemens AG 
and Siemens Energy AG must each declare in the filing pursuant to Section  125 sentence  1 in 
conjunction with Section  16 (2) sentence  1 UmwG that a complaint against the validity of the 
resolution on the Spin -off has not been filed or has not been filed in a timely manner or that such a 
complaint has been dismissed by final judgment or withdrawn (also referred to as a negative 
declaration ( Negativerklärung )), which they would not be able to do if a complaint had been filed 
in a timely manner. As regards the approving resolution of Siemens Energy AG, Siemens  AG, as 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  107 the sole shareholder, will waive the filing of a complaint  in the shareholders ' meeting. As regards 
the approving resolution of  the shareholders ' meeting of Siemens AG, however, the possibility 
cannot be ruled out that one or more shareholders challenge the resolution. However, even in the 
event that actions to set aside a resolution for legal defects ( Beschlussmängelklagen ) have been 
filed in a timely manner against the spin -off resolution of the shareholders' meeting of Siemens AG 
and, accordingly, no negative declaration can be provided, the Spin -off can nonetheless be 
registered provided that the court of appeals ( Oberlandesger icht) having jurisdiction pursuant to 
Section  125 sentence  1 in conjunction with Section  16 (3) sentence  7 UmwG has determined by a 
decision pursuant to Section  125 sentence  1 in conjunction with Section  16 (3) sentence  1 UmwG 
that the filing of the compla int does not prevent the registration (also referred to as clearance 
decision ( Freigabeentscheidung )). The decision is incontestable under Section  125 sentence  1 in 
conjunction with Section  16 (3) sentence  9 UmwG. Pursuant to Section  125 sentence  1 in 
conjunction with Section  16 (3) sentence  3 UmwG, the decision will be issued if (i) the complaint 
is inadmissible or obviously without merit, or (ii) the complainant has not proven within one week 
after service of the request by means of documents that the com plainant holds a pro rata  amount 
of at least EUR  1,000 in the capital stock of Siemens  AG since the date of publication of the notice 
calling the meeting, or (iii) the immediate coming into effect of the Spin -off appears to take priority 
because the materi al harm demonstrated by Siemens AG for the entities involved in the Spin -off 
and their shareholders outweighs the harm for the complaining shareholder in the free discretion of 
the court, unless there has been a particularly severe violation of law.  
The ma naging board of Siemens AG is of the opinion that a delayed coming into effect of the Spin -
off would be harmful to Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG and would be contrary to the interests 
of the Siemens Shareholders because it would delay the realization of  the benefits expected by a 
separate development of the two companies and it would also cause additional costs.  
12. Effects of the Registrations with the Register of Companies  
The Spin -off becomes effective upon the last registration with the registers of companies of the 
involved entities. Thereupon, the Spin -off Assets pass to Siemens Energy AG by force of law by 
way of partial universal succession. At the same time, the shareholders of Siemens AG will become 
shareholders of Siemens Energy AG by force of law in accordance with the relevant share allocation 
ratio set forth in §  10.1 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement, i.e., they will be granted one 
Siemens Energy Share for each two Siemens Shares. Any possible defects in the notarization of the 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement will be cured by the registration with the register of companies.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  108 13. Allocation of the Shares; Fractional Rights; Admission to and Trading on the Stock 
Exchange; ADR Program  
 Allocation of the Shares of Siemens Energy AG issued to the S hareholders of 
Siemens AG in Connection with the Spin -off 
The Spin -off will be effected in exchange for the granting of 399,654,856  Siemens Energy Shares 
of no-par value  (registered shares)  at the time the Spin -off takes effect. Upon the Spin -off taking 
effect, the shareholders  of Siemens AG  will receive one Siemens Energy Share for every two 
Siemens Shares in accordance with the share allocation ratio of 2:1 (preserving the proportionate 
shareholdings) set forth in §  10.1 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement (with regard to the share 
allocation ratio, cf. Chapter  VII.). The shares to be granted will be created through the Spin-Off 
Capital Increase described in Chapter  VI.10.  
Treasury share s of Siemens AG will not be considered in the allotment of Siemens Energy Shares.  
The custodian banks will determine who is a Siemens  Shareholder for purposes of the allocation 
on the evening of the day on which the Spin -off takes effect as a result of the  latest of the 
registrations with the registers of companies of Siemens AG (" Allocation Effective Date ") on the 
basis of the respective holdings of Siemens Shares on securities accounts on the evening of the 
Allocation Effective Date, taking into account a ny stock exchange transactions still outstanding.  
A total of 399,654,856  shares in Siemens Energy AG will be issued to the shareholders of Siemens 
AG. Siemens AG will ensure by way of acquisitions and sales of treasury shares that 
799,309 ,712 shares will be entitled to allocation at the time when the Spin -off is registered.  
 Entitlement to Participate in Profits  
All of the Siemens Energy S hares granted as consideration for the transfer of the Spin -off Assets 
are entitled to participate in profits for the fi scal years from 1  October 2019 onwards. If the Spin -
off Effective Date is postponed to 1  October 2020 ( cf. Chapter  VI.7.), the date as of which the 
shares to be granted will be entitled to participate in profits will be postponed accordingly to 
1 October 2 020. If the Spin -off Effective Date is postponed further, the date as of which the shares 
to be granted will be entitled to participate in profits will be postponed accordingly, in each case, 
by one year.  
 Processing  
Siemens AG has commissioned Deutsche Ban k AG, Frankfurt a m Main, with the processing of the 
share allocation . Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt a m Main, has also been appointed by Siemens AG 
to act as trustee pursuant to Section  125 sentence  1 in conjunction with Section  71 (1) UmwG and, 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  109 in that capac ity, to accept delivery of the shares in Siemens Energy AG to be granted and to issue 
them to the entitled shareholders. The trustee will take po ssession of the Siemens Energy S hares to 
be issued to the shareholders of Siemens AG prior to the Spin -off taki ng effect and will provide 
these shares to the shareholders of Siemens AG in a timely manner after the Spin -off takes effect 
in accordance with the share allocation ratio of 2:1 set forth in §  10.1 of the Spin -off and Transfer  
Agreement. The Siemens Energy  Shares will be allocated to the entitled shareholders of Siemens 
AG through Clearstream  Banking AG, Frankfurt a m Main, ("Clearstream ") by their respective 
custodian banks crediting the shares to their respective securities accounts in the ratio of 2:1. The 
allocation of shares is free of commissions and fees for the Siemens Shareholders who are entitled 
to an allocation and who hold thei r Siemens Shares in securities accounts in Germany. 
Commissions and fees might be incurred by Siemens Shareholders who hold their Siemens Shares 
in securities accounts in other countries based on the existing agreements with the relevant 
custodian bank. De tails regarding the processing of the allocation will be notified separately to the 
shareholders of Siemens AG without undue delay after the registration of the Spin -off with the 
registers of companies of Siemens Energy AG and Siemens AG (the " Share Alloca tion 
Notification "). The Share Allocation Notification will be published by Siemens AG in Germany 
in the Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ). 
Since all shares in Siemens AG are represented by global certificates deposited with Clearstream, 
the Siemens Shareho lders do not need to take any action with regard to the allocation of the Siemens 
Energy Shares, except in the event of a settlement of any fractional amounts (fractional shares 
(Aktienteilrechte )). The relevant custodian banks will normally credit the Sie mens Energy Shares 
to the securities account of the relevant Siemens Shareholder even prior to the start of trading  on 
the first stock exchange trading day following the Allocation Effective Date provided that these are 
not based on fractional shares for t he account of the shareholders  (see below Chapter VI.13.d)). 
The entitlement of the shareholders of Siemens Energy AG to certification of their shares is 
excluded pursuant to the articles of association of Siemens Energy AG. The shares of no-par value  
of Siemens Energy AG will be represented by global share certificates along with respective bearer  
global  dividend coupons (Inhaber -Globalgewinnanteilschein ) and deposited with Clearstream; the 
shareholders of Siemens Energy AG will participate as co -owners of  the global certificates and the 
bearer global dividend coupons in accordance with their respective shareholdings.  
 Fractional Rights  
Due to the above stated share allocation ratio of 2:1, there will be fractional shares (fractional rights 
(Teilrechte )) if the holdings of Siemens Shares on securities accounts cannot be evenly divided by 
2. The relevant shareholders of Siemens AG will then receive fractional rights to one share in 
Siemens Energy AG. Since shareholder rights can generally not be asserted on th e basis of 
fractional rights (see Section  213 (2) AktG), Deutsche Bank AG, as the central settlement agent, 
together with the custodian banks will use its best efforts to achieve compensation between the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  110 holders of the fractional rights so that these holde rs are able to sell fractional rights or acquire 
corresponding fractional rights in order to top up to full rights. Any acquisition of further fractional 
rights to top up to full rights (referred to as the settlement of fractions ( Spitzenregulierung )) requires 
a corresponding purchase or sales order. It is to be expected that banks, especially in other countries, 
will not cooperate in any settlement of fractions or will not accept corresponding orders in particular 
cases.  
To the extent that orders for a cquiring further fractional rights in order to top up to full rights are 
not issued, or any acquisition of further fractional rights to top up to full rights is not possible on 
the basis of the issued orders, at a point in time still to be determined, Deut sche Bank AG, which 
has been appointed by Siemens AG as the trustee, will combine the fract ional rights to Siemens 
Energy S hares that have been allocated to Siemens Shares and have not yet been combined to full 
rights (shares) of Siemens Energy AG and will  sell them via the stock exchange. The sales proceeds 
will then be credited to the relevant holders of fractional rights pro rata  according to their respective 
fractional rights. The settlement of fractional rights is effected free of commissions and fees for the 
entitled persons who hold their Siemens Shares in securities accounts in Germany. Commissions 
and fees might be incurred by Siemens Shareholders who hold their Siemens Shares in securities 
accounts in other countries based on the existing agreement s with the relevant custodian bank.  
 Admission to and Trading on the Stock Exchange  
It is planned that all the shares of Siemens Energy AG will be admitted to trading on the Regulated 
Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and also in the sub -segment of the  Regulated Market of 
the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with additional post -admission obligations (Prime Standard) on the 
Allocation Effective Date. The shares of Siemens Energy AG are to be traded for the first time on 
the morning of the subsequent stock excha nge trading day. The listing of the shares of Siemens AG 
"ex Spin-Off" is planned for the same day. On the Allocation Effective Date, trading of shares in 
Siemens Energy AG will not yet be possible, and the Siemens AG Shares will still be traded "cum

 Procedure regarding ADR Program  
In the United States, shares in Siemens AG are traded off -exchange in the form of American 
Depositary Receipt s (ADRs). The deposit agreement existing in this context between Siemens AG 
and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Ame ricas as depositary provides that, in the event of 
distributions of Siemens AG on deposited securities (i.e. the Siemens Shares on which the ADRs 
are based) made other than in cash, subscription rights or additional Siemens Shares, the depositary 
will be e ntitled, under certain circumstances and after consultation with Siemens AG, to distribute 
to the holders of the ADRs the net proceeds from the sale of the securities  to be deposited (i.e. the 
Siemens Energy Shares)  in lieu of the securities. The depositar y is entitled to do so if, in 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  111 coordination with Siemens AG, the depositary considers a distribution of securities to be illegal, 
unfair or not practicable. Against this background , a delegate of the depositary  will sell the Siemens 
Energy S hares attributab le to the ADRs after commencement of the stock exchange trading and 
distribute the proceeds pro rata  and net of costs to the holders of the ADRs.  
14. Shareholder Structure of the Transferring Entity and the Receiving Entity after 
Completion of the Spin -off 
Upon the Spin -off taking effect, Siemens AG will directly hold a participation of approximately  
32.98  % in the capital stock of Siemens Energy AG (subject to the transfer of shares to SPT  e.V.). 
SBI GmbH will hold a participation of approximately  12.02  % in the capital stock of Siemens 
Energy AG.  
Upon the Spin -off taking effect, all other Siemens Energy Shares, i.e. a total of 55  % of the capital 
stock, will be held by the Siemens Shareholders. The notional share of each shareholder in the 
capital stock of Si emens Energy AG issued in the course of the Spin-Off Capital Increase will be 
equivalent to such shareholder's notional share in the capital stock of Siemens AG, provided that 
treasury shares of Siemens AG will not be taken into account (referred to as a s pin-off retaining the 
existing shareholding ( verhältniswahrende Abspaltung )). 
Siemens Energy AG will, in turn, hold 100  % of the fixed capital of Siemens Energy KG as well 
as all shares in the General Partner GmbH, which acts as the general partner of Siem ens Energy 
KG. For further information about the legal structure of the Future Siemens Energy Group after the 
Spin-off, see Chapter  X.4. 
In the context of the Spin -off, Siemens AG will transfer Siemens Energy Shares to SPT  e.V. in an 
amount equivalent to 9.9 % of the capital stock.  
The Spin-off will not cause changes in the ownership structure  of Siemens  AG as transferring 
entity . 
15. Deconsolidation  Agreement  
As regards the future participation of the Future Siemens Group in Siemens Energy AG, Siemens 
AG, SBI  GmbH and Siemens Energy AG have entered into a Deconsolidation  Agreement in the 
context of the conclusion of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement. The Siemens Energy Business 
is to be conducted by Siemens Energy  AG autonomously and independently of Siemens  AG ( cf. 
Chapter  III.1. and Chapter  III.4.). Siemens  AG does not intend to exert, directly or indirectly, 
controlling influence on Siemens Energy  AG. After the Spin -off taking effect, the Siemens Energy 
Business will no longer be fully consolidated in Siemens AG's consolidated financial stat ements. 
Given the fact that Siemens AG does not have a majority holding, it is not presumed pursuant to  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  112 Section  17 (2) AktG  that, after the Spin-off taking effect , Siemens Energy  AG will still be 
depending on Siemens  AG. In the event, which cannot be compl etely ruled out, that, at future 
shareholders ' meetings of Siemens Energy AG, Siemens  AG directly and indirectly , especially via 
the shares held by SBI  GmbH , will hold the majority of the voting shares represented at the relevant 
shareholders ' meeting, Sie mens AG and SBI  GmbH have ensured by means of the Deconsolidation  
Agreement attached to the Spin -Off and Transfer Agreement as Annex  19 that, after the Spin -Off 
taking effect, the Future Siemens Group will no longer be able to exert controlling influence o n the 
Siemens Energy Business and on Siemens Energy  AG. 
The provisions of the Deconsolidation  Agreement are set out in Chapter  XIII.3.  
The Deconsolidation  Agreement does not affect the fact that Siemens AG and the Future Siemens 
Group Companies will most l ikely be classified as related persons of Siemens Energy AG within 
the meaning of Section  111a (1) sentence  2 AktG (in this regard, see Chapter  VIII.3.h)).  
16. Group Separation Agreement  
As regards the group separation of the Future Siemens Energy Group from t he Siemens Group , 
resulting upon the closing of the Spin -Off and Transfer Agreement, Siemens AG and Siemens 
Energy AG entered into a group separation agreement (" Group Separation Agreement "). This 
Group Separation Agreement is annexed to the Spin -off and T ransfer Agreement and forms a part 
thereof. It contains in particular provisions governing the legal relationship between the parties and 
their respective group companies after completion of the Spin -off with regard to their former joint 
association with t he Siemens Group. The provisions of the Group Separation Agreement are set out 
in Chapter  XIII.4.  
17. Costs and Taxes associated  with the Spin -off 
The costs of the Spin -off and its implementation consist of external one -time costs and taxes.  
The external one -time costs amount to around EUR  20 million  as of 31  March 2020. Additional 
external costs of the Spin -off are expected to arise in the amount of approximately EUR 90 million  
by the time the Spin -off takes effect so that the total external one-time costs of the Spin -off and its 
implementation will be in a range of around EUR  110 million  (with regard to the additionally 
arising costs for the Carve -out, see Chapter  V.14). The external one -time costs relate primarily to 
costs for external consu lting (especially by investment banks, legal advisors and other advisors), 
audit costs (auditors), notarization costs, costs of shareholders' meetings, costs for the filings with 
the registers of companies and costs for the planned admission to stock excha nge trading. These 
costs will mainly be borne by Siemens AG. In addition, external one -time costs directly related to 
the Siemens Energy Business (in particular additional legal costs, additional advice by auditing and 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  113 consulting firms or advice in connect ion with establishing the stand -alone business plan for the 
Siemens Energy Business) will partly also be borne by Siemens Energy KG.  
Taxes arising in connection with the Spin -off and its implementation are estimated to be 
approximately EUR  10 million . Thes e taxes include in particular expenses from the depreciation 
of deferred tax assets and the transaction taxes (including real estate transfer tax) arising from the 
implementation of the Spin -Off. The transaction taxes will be borne by Siemens  AG to the ext ent 
they relate to Siemens Energy AG . 
There is the risk that the reduction of the shareholding  in the Future Siemens Energy Group 
Companies upon effectiveness of the Spin -off may trigger additional taxes on a local level, in 
particular in the form of so-called "degrouping charges". Should this risk materialize, it is expected 
that the resulting amount will not exceed the mid double -digit million Euro range.  
  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  114 VII. Explanation and Reasons for the Share Allocation Ratio in Connection with the Spin -off 
The Spin -off of the Spin -off Assets is taking place in exchange for granting Siemens Energy  Shares  
to the Siemens Shareholders . The allocation ratio for the granting of the shares must be set forth in 
the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement (Section  126 (1) no.  3 UmwG). P ursuant to §  10.1 of the Spin -
off and Transfer Agreement, this ratio is established in the present case at 2:1, which means each  
Siemens Shareholder receives one Siemens Energy  Share for each two Siemens Shares. Additional 
cash payments are not granted.  
The allocation ratio was mainly determined by the future capital stock of  Siemens Energy  AG, its 
number of shares and by the fact that the Spin -off relates to a 55  % participation. In the opinion of 
the legal entities involved, the amount of the future cap ital stock is in a reasonable proportion to 
the equity and the expected market capitalization of  Siemens Energy  AG and reasonably reflects 
the relative sizes of the transferring entity and the receiving entity. When determining the capital 
stock and the nu mber of shares, it was considered that from today 's point of view the future stock 
price of  Siemens Energy  AG should lie within an at tractive  range  for private and institutional 
investors.  
The lowest possible portion of  EUR  1.00 per share was chosen when s etting the proportionate 
amount of the shares in the capital stock of  Siemens Energy  AG in order to create a number of 
shares as high as possible with the chosen capital stock of EUR  726,645,193 . The resulting 
allocation ratio takes into account that the n umber of fractional rights ( Teilrechte ) is held as low as 
possible so that as many shareholders as possible become shareholders in  Siemens Energy  AG in a 
manner corresponding to their participations in  Siemens  AG. An allocation ratio of 2:1 enables to 
allocate one or multiple shares in  Siemens Energy  AG to a large portion of the shareholdings and 
to Siemens Shareholders without creating fractional  rights. If a shareholder holds less than two 
Siemens Shares or a number of Siemens Shares which is not divisible by  two, the contemplated 
regulation of the fractional  rights permits the acquisition of fractional  rights for most likely limited 
amounts of money in order to ensure the allocation of one Siemens Energy Share (more details on 
the regulation on fr actional  rights are described comprehensively in Chapter  VI.13.d) ). The only 
alternative to exclude fractional  rights would have been an exchange ratio of one to one.  
A lower allocation ratio would have required a higher capital stock and thereby missed th e above 
mentioned goal of having an attractive stock exchange price for the  Siemens Energy Share, because 
the enterprise value would have been distributed over an increasing number of shares in the case of 
increasing capital stock anda proportionately incr easing number of shares required for a lower 
allocation ratio.  
In order to realize an allocation ratio of  2:1, Siemens  AG will ensure that the number of shares 
entitled to an allocation as of the Closing Date in accordance with Section  131 (1) no.  3 senten ce 1 
UmwG will be 799,309,712 . This allows a clear division with the chosen allocation ratio. Siemens 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  115 AG has undertaken in the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement to ensure that on the Closing Date, the 
number of the total issued shares of Siemens AG minus the  treasury shares which are not entitled 
to an allocation under Section  131 (1) no.  3 sentence  1 UmwG will be exactly  799,309,712  (see 
Chapter  XIII.1.j)).  
For the determination of the allocation ratio , a comparative enterprise valuation under which, on 
the one hand, the Spin -off Assets and, on the other hand, the receiving entity would have been 
valued and these values would have been compared to each other, was not required.  
The Spin -off Assets only consist of  a fractional partnership limited interest in Siemens Energy  KG 
in the amount of 55  % of the fixed capital and of shares in the General Partner GmbH, which 
correspond to  exactly  55 % of the total share capital. This is set against the assets of Siemens 
Energy  AG, which consist of limited partnership i nterests  with a share of 45  % of the fixed capital 
of Siemens Energy KG to be contributed to Siemens Energy AG by Siemens AG  and SBI GmbH 
under the Capital Increases in Kind and shares in the General Partner GmbH  representing exactly 
45 % of the total shar e capital . At the time of the Spin -off taking effect Siemens Energy  AG will 
not have any other assets in economic terms and will not report any liabilities (see  Chapter  II.5.h)), 
so that from an economic perspective the valuation objects are identical.  
The fixed capit al in Siemens Energy KG and the  shares in the General Partner GmbH held by 
Siemens AG or Siemens Energy  AG, respectively, are in a ratio of 55:45. Accordingly, the 
participation ratios of the Siemens Shareholders on the one hand and Siemens  AG and SBI GmbH 
on the other hand are supposed to correspond when the Spin -off takes effect. The 399,654,856 new 
Siemens Energy Shares  to be issued in order to implement the Spin -off will be 55  % of the capital 
stock of Siemens Energy  AG existing when the Spi n-off takes effect, and the Siemens Energy  
Shares  held by Siemens  AG and SBI GmbH after the Capital Increases in Kind takes effect will be  
45 %. The result is that the number of the shares to be issued in order to implement the Spin -off 
ensures that the value relation between the Spin -off Assets and the receiving entity is exactly 
reflected in the shareholders structure.  
The granting of shares as consideration for the transfer of the Spin -off Assets to the Siemens 
Shareholders will take p lace in a manner preserving the proportionate participations, which means 
in accordance with the level of their participation in Siemens  AG. The mathematical participations 
in Siemens Energy AG will not correspond to the mathematical participations in Siem ens AG due 
to the remaining (direct and indirect) participation of Siemens AG in Siemens Energy AG when 
the Spin -off takes effect. From an economic point of view,  however,  the Siemens Shareholders own 
100 % of Siemens Energy  AG, thereby maintaining existin g ownership ratios, namely, 55  % 
directly and 45 % through their participation in Siemens AG and partly further passed on through 
Siemens AG's wholly owned subsidiary SBI GmbH. Thus, the Siemens Shareholders are not 
deprived of any assets.  Therefore, a com parative enterprise valuation is not necessary . 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE

whether the proposed allocation ratio is reasonable.  
  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  117 VIII.  Financial Position , Tax and Other Effects of the Spin -off 
This Chapter discusses the financial position , tax and other effects of the Spin -off and measures 
relating thereto.  
1. Effects on the Financial Position of the Capital Increases in Kind and the Spin -off 
 Overview and Introduction  
 Transaction -related Measures reflected in the Statements of Financial Position  
This section deals with the  effects on the financial position of the Spin -off and the Capital Increases 
in Kind, i.e. the following steps described in detail in Chapter  VI: 
 The taking effect of the contributions of a partial  limited  partnership interest  or a 
partnership interest , respectively, in the total amount of 45  % of the fixed capital of 
Siemens Energy KG by Siemens AG and SBI GmbH to Siemens Energy AG as well as of 
shares in a German limited liability company (GmbH) corresponding to an aggregate 
participation of 45  % in General Partner GmbH, in the course of Capita l Increases in Kind 
with economic effect as of 1  April 2020 (a detailed description of these measures is set out 
in Chapter  VI.3.).  
 The taking effect of the Spin -off of the then remaining limited partnership interest held by 
Siemens AG in Siemens Energy KG  as well as the remaining shares held by Siemens AG 
in General Partner GmbH to Siemens Energy AG against the issuance of shares in Siemens 
Energy AG to the Siemens Shareholders with economic effect as of 1  April 2020, including 
the Deconsolidation  Agreemen t entered into as an annex to the Spin -off and Transfer 
Agreement (a detailed description of these measures is set out in Chapter  VI.).  
 Relevant Statements of Financial Position  
The description and explanation of the effects on the financial position will be illustrated based on 
the following statements of financial position:  
 Individual statements of financial position of Siemens AG as of 31  March 2020 (HGB) 
(derived from the closing statements of financial position within the meaning of §  3.1 of 
the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement and Section  17 (2), Section  125 UmwG)  
 Consolidated statements of financial position of the Siemens Group as of 31  March 2020 
(IFRS)  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  118  Individual statements of financial position of Siemens Energy AG as of 31  March 2020 
(HGB). Since Siemens Energy AG was economically incorporated only as of 1  April 2020 
and previously has not carried out any business activity or held any participations, and, in 
particular, has not formed a group of companies within the meaning of Section  290 et seqq.  
HGB with the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies, there are no consolidated 
statements of financial position of Siemens Energy AG as of 31  March 2020 available.  
 Pro forma individual statements of financial position of Siemens AG as of 1  April 2020 
(HGB)  
 Pro forma consolidated statements of financial position of the Siemens Group as of 1  April 
2020 (IFRS)  
 Pro forma individual statements of financial position of Siemens Energy AG as of 1  April 
2020 (HGB)  
 Pro forma combined  statements of financial position o f the Future Siemens Energy Group 
as of 1  April 2020 (IFRS) in which the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies are 
presented in a combined  manner . 
 Situation reflected in the Statements of Financial Position as of 31  March 2020  
The individual statements of financial position and the consolidated statements of financial position 
of the Siemens Group, each as of 31  March 2020, reflect the situation prior to the Capital Increases 
in Kind and the Spin -off taking effect. The individual statements of financial pos ition of Siemens 
AG include the contribution of the Siemens Energy Business, which previously has been directly 
conducted by Siemens AG, to Siemens Energy KG as of 1  January 2020. The consolidated 
statements of financial position of the Siemens Group as of  31 March 2020 reflect the Siemens 
Energy Business as a disposal  group pursuant to IFRS 5, " Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations ". This does not include the 24  % participation in Siemens Ltd., India 
allocated to the Siemens Energy B usiness, as the Future Siemens Group will continue to fully 
consolidate the remaining 51  % participation.  
 Assumptions underlying the Pro Forma Statements of Financial Position  
The pro forma statements of financial position as of 1  April 2020 reflect the assets of the legal 
entity or group as of the relevant reporting  date taking into account the following pro forma 
assumptions:  
 The Spin -off has taken effect in fiscal year 2020. The Spin -off will be implemented with 
effect as of the Spin -off Effective Date, i.e., 1  April 2020, 0 .00 hours . Siemens  AG will 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  119 reflect the Spin -off Assets at book values in its individual financial  statements (HGB). The 
Spin-off Effective Date is the point in time as of which the actions of Siemens  AG relating 
to the Spin -off Assets are deemed to have been made for the account of Siemens Energy 
AG (Section  126 (1) no.  6 UmwG). This means that the Sp in-off and, thus, the transfer of 
the Spin -off Assets will be deemed to take economic effect retroactively as of 1  April 2020, 
0.00 hours . By preparing the pro forma statements of financial position as of 1  April 2020, 
0.00 hours , the material direct effec ts of the Spin -off on the statement of financial position 
are anticipated based on the values set out in the statements of financial position as of 
31 March 2020, 24 .00 hours . 
 In the pro forma statements of financial position, the two Capital Increases in Kind by way 
of which Siemens AG and SBI GmbH contribute limited partnership interests in Siemens 
Energy KG and participations in General Partner GmbH (see Chapter  VI.3 above) to 
Siemens Energy AG are assumed (to have been completed) with retroactive econom ic 
effect as of 1  April 2020. The contribution agreement, which constitutes the basis for the 
Capital Increases in Kind, does not provide that Siemens Energy AG recognizes the 
contributed participations at book values in its individual financial  statements  (HGB). The 
new Siemens Energy Shares granted as consideration will be issued at the nominal amount 
of EUR  1.00 per share; an additional premium is not owed. For the purpose of describing 
the effects on the statement of financial position in this Chapter i t is assumed that Siemens 
Energy  AG recognizes the issue price as acquisition costs of the newly created shares in its 
individual financial  statements (HGB).  
 Taking into account the Deconsolidation  Agreement, which was entered into at the same 
time as the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement and which comes into effect upon the Spin -
off taking effect (for details cf. Chapter  XIII.3.), the Spin -off will result in Siemens AG no 
longer controlling Siemens Energy AG within the meaning of IFRS  10 upon the Spin -off 
taking effect, with the effect that the Siemens Energy Business will no longer be fully 
consolidated in the consolidated financial statements of Siemens AG. This effect of the 
deconsolidation has also been accounted for in the pro forma consolidated statemen ts of 
financial position as of 1  April 2020.  
 Moreover, the pro forma statements of financial position have been prepared based on the 
general assumption (subject to the restrictions set out below) that steps to be taken for the 
Carve -out of the Siemens Ene rgy Business that were not yet completed by 31  March 2020 
(cf. Chapter  V.1.e)) became economically effective as of 1  April 2020. The pro forma 
statements of financial position therefore account for the separation of the Local Siemens 
Energy Business from t he Local Remaining Siemens Business and the (indirect) transfer 
of the Local Siemens Energy Business to Siemens Energy KG and, thus, to the Future 
Siemens Energy Group, irrespective of the – possibly later – date as of which the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  120 underlying measures will ta ke effect. To the extent that the Future Siemens Energy Group 
directly or indirectly acquires Future Siemens Energy Group Companies against payment 
of a purchase price, payment of the expected purchase price is deemed to have been 
effected as of 1  April 20 20. The above -mentioned pro forma assumption also applies to 
assets the transfer of which is still subject to the consent of third parties or with respect to 
which a change of control occurring upon the Spin -off taking effect might potentially 
trigger term ination rights of contractual partners, retransfer obligations or other third party 
rights affecting the assets of the Future Siemens Energy Group; this is conceivable for 
example with regard to the various participations in joint ventures attributable to the 
Siemens Energy Business (for more details on joint ventures, see Chapter  V.1.f)).  
 If and to the extent that the agreements regarding the transfer of shares in Local Siemens 
Energy Group Companies that have been entered into in the context of the Carve -out 
provide for base purchase prices or variable purchase prices, as the case may be, it is 
assumed that the relevant preliminary purchase price or base purchase price agreed therein 
is the final purchase price (for more details see Chapter  V.1.e)). This a pplies in particular 
to the transfer of a 24  % participation in Siemens Ltd., India , anticipated in the pro forma 
statements of financial position (cf. Chapter  V.1.e).cc)).  
 If the relevant pending steps are ultimately not implemented, the future statements  of 
financial position may deviate from the pro forma statements of financial position.  
Of the steps required for the Carve -out of the Siemens Energy Business, the pro forma statements 
of financial position as of 1  April 2020 do not anticipate the transfer  of the 40  % participation in 
Shanghai Electric Power Generation Equipment Co. LTD. held by a company of the Future 
Siemens Group to the Future Siemens Energy Group because that transfer is not intended to be 
effected until fiscal year 2021 (see, in this c ontext, Chapter  V.1.f)). The Future Siemens Energy 
Group will acquire the participation in the company currently held by a company of the Future 
Siemens Group against payment of a purchase price. The expected purchase price has already been 
taken into acco unt in the financial and capital structure  of the Future Siemens Energy Group. In the 
pro forma statements of financial position of the Future Siemens Group as of 1  April 2020, the 
40 % participation in Shanghai Electric Power Generation Equipment Co. LTD is shown under the 
item "assets classified as held for disposal".  
Moreover, the pro forma statements of financial position as of 1 April 2020 do not take into account 
changes in the assets and liabilities resulting from the business activities of the compa nies of the 
Future Siemens Energy Group and of the Future Siemens Group performed in the period from 
1 April 2020 to the effective date of the Spin -off. This also applies to business transactions between 
the two groups. Transactions after 1  April 2020 are also not taken into account in the pro forma 
statements of financial position if they have a close connection to the Spin -off. For example, the 
granting of equivalent rights to beneficiaries in the context of stock -based compensation programs 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  121 and employee participation programs or any Transaction Costs arising in connection with the Spin -
off are not taken into account to the extent that they are attributable to the period as of 1  April 2020. 
Transaction Costs allocable to the period up to and including 31  March 2020, however, are already 
reflected in the corresponding statements of financial position as of 31  March 2020 (with regard to 
the Transactions Costs incurred in the context of the Carve -out and the Spin -off, see also 
Chapters  V.14. and V.17.).  
In the  context of the legal separation of the Siemens Energy Business, certain lease, license, service 
and other agreements will be entered into between and implemented by the Future Siemens Energy 
Group Companies conducting the Local Siemens Energy Business and  the Future Siemens Group 
Companies. In the event that these agreements affect the statements of financial position on or 
before the day the Spin -off takes effect, these effects have not been accounted for in the pro forma 
statements of financial position as of 1  April 2020 either. The above applies except for the license 
fee for using the "Siemens Energy" trademark, which has been charged since the beginning of fiscal 
year 2020 (see, in this regard, also Chapter  XI.3.).  
Financial  effects due to deferred taxes resulting from the Carve -out of the Siemens Energy Business 
which will be transferred after 31  March 2020 ( cf. Chapter  V.1.e)) are not anticipated in the pro 
forma consolidated statements of financial position of the Future S iemens Energy Group as of 
1 April 2020. Furthermore, while the transfer of real estate property and buildings of the Local 
Siemens Energy Business which will be transferred after 31  March 2020 (cf. Chapter  V.1.e)) are 
anticipated in the pro forma statement s of financial position of the Future Siemens Group as of 
1 April 2020, they are not included in the pro forma statements of financial position of the Future 
Siemens Energy Group as of 1  April 2020 for practical reasons and for lack of materiality.  
With a view to the Spin -off, Siemens AG will recognize, upon its shareholders' meeting approving 
the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement and pursuant to IFRIC 17, "Distributions of Non -cash Assets 
to Owners", a Spin -off liability in the consolidated statements of fin ancial position with a fair value 
(beizulegender Zeitwert ) equivalent to 55  % of the value of the Future Siemens Energy Group, 
thereby reducing equity (at the expense of retained earnings ). In the event of a delay in the Spin -
off taking effect, the Spin -off liability would have to be recognized at the relevant fair value as of 
subsequent accounting dates until the Spin -off taking effect; the equity would have to be adjusted 
accordingly. Upon the Spin -off and the Deconsolidation  Agreement taking effect, Siem ens will 
reflect the derecognition of this Spin -off liability and the book value of the assets and liabilities 
classified as held for disposal, and the recognition of the 45  % participation in Siemens Energy AG, 
which is to be included upon receipt at fair  value; any difference must be reflected in the profit and 
loss as the result of the Spin -off (Spin -off profit/loss). These effects have not been anticipated in 
the pro forma consolidated statements of financial position of Siemens AG as of 1  April 2020.  
Siemens AG intends to transfer, in connection with the Spin -off, a percentage of 9.9% of the shares 
in Siemens Energy AG to SPT e.V. in the form of an addition of funds ( Dotierung ) (in this regard, 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  122 see already Chapter  I.). This transfer has not been reflect ed in the pro forma consolidated statements 
of financial position of the Future Siemens Group as of 1  April 2020.  
On 28  April 2020, Siemens AG and SBI GmbH further strengthened the equity of Siemens Energy 
KG by way of an agreement on the additional paymen t to the jointly held reserve account 
(gesamthänderisch gebundene s Rücklage nkonto ) in the fixed amount of EUR  141 million and a 
conditional minor additional equity contribution (see in this regard also Chapter  V.3a).). The 
financial  effects of this subsequ ent strengthening of the equity are not reflected in the pro forma 
statements of financial position.  
The companies of the Future Siemens Energy Group are currently still directly or indirectly 
financed through Siemens AG. These receivables and liabilities are still reflected in the individual 
statements of financial position and the pro forma individual and consolidated statements of 
financial position. To the extent necessary, Siemens Energy AG intends to r eplace  this financing 
of the Future Siemens Energy  Group by Siemens AG by way of external debt financing obtained 
from an international banking consortium (see Chapter  V.3.a)). This is not reflected in the pro 
forma individual and consolidated statements of financial position as of 1  April 2020.  
The takin g effect of the Spin -off in conjunction with the taking effect of the Deconsolidation  
Agreement at the same time (in this regard, see Chapter  XIII.3.) results in the termination of control 
of Siemens AG over the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies, which  continues to exist up 
until that point in time. This change of control might trigger certain rights of contractual partners 
under existing agreements which may result in payment obligations or may have an impact on the 
statements of financial position  for the relevant group companies. No such – currently unknown – 
financial  effects have been recognized in the pro forma statements of financial position as of 1  April 
2020.  
The actual statements of financial position as of the point in time when the Spin -off takes effect 
may, in particular in view of the aforementioned effects that have not been anticipated, deviate 
considerably from the pro forma statements of financial position.  
 Preparation, Determination and Audit of the relevant Statements of Financial 
Position  
The individual statements of financial position were prepared in each case in accordance with the 
accounting principles under HGB and the consolidated statements of financial position of Siemens 
AG as of 31  March 2020 were prepared in accordance with  IFRS applicable to  interim financial 
reporting as issued  by the IASB and as adopted by the European Union (EU). The pro forma 
statements of financial position are based on corresponding accounting principles under HGB for 
the pro forma individual statemen ts of financial position and in accordance with IFRS for the pro 
forma consolidated  and combined  financial statements,  for which – as will be described in more

individual and consolidated financial statements of Siemens AG as of 30  September 2019. 
However, changes in the accounting standards applicable as of 1  October 2019, in particular 
IFRS  16, have been accounted for in the application rules.

is granted to Siemens AG in addition to new shares – is not discernible from the pro forma statements of financial positio n because of 
the rounding to full millions of Euros.  
 Effects of the Spin -off shown in the Statements of Financial Position  
The individual statements of financial position of Siemens AG as of 31  March 2020, 24 .00 hours , 
contain under the item "financial ass ets" in particular the direct interest in Siemens Energy KG in 
the amount of EUR  20,281  million , corresponding to a percentage of approximately  87.98 % of the 
fixed capital of Siemens Energy KG, the 100  % participation in SBI GmbH, which in turn holds a 
approximately  12.02  % interest in the fixed capital of Siemens Energy KG, which corresponds to 
a carrying amount of the investment of EUR  192 million , as well as the 100  % participation in 
Siemens Energy AG in the amount of EUR  180 thousand . These statements  of financial position 
already reflect the contribution to Siemens Energy KG of the Siemens Energy Business as of 
1 January 2020, which had previously been conducted directly by Siemens AG. The resulting effect 
is that items of the non -current and current assets belonging to the Siemens Energy Business as 
well as liabilities that had still been reflected in the statements of financial position of Siemens AG 
as of 30  September 2019 were derecognized from the statements of financial position of Siemens 
AG and  set off by a matching recognition under "financial assets" (participation in Siemens Energy 
KG). As a result of the contribution of the German Siemens Energy Business  Operation , as of 
31 March 2020, Siemens AG conducts the Siemens Energy Business no longe r directly but 
exclusively indirectly via its subsidiaries. The Siemens Energy Business therefore exclusively 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  126 affects the "financial assets" item in the statements of financial position as of 31  March 2020, the 
"receivables from affiliated companies"/"liab ilities to affiliated companies" items and tax items. 
The contribution of the part of the Siemens Energy Business previously conducted by subsidiaries 
in particular by way of the contribution of Siemens Energy B.V. and Siemens Energy Inc. to 
Siemens Energy  KG is not discernible from the individual statements of financial position of 
Siemens AG as of 31  March 2020 because this transaction merely resulted in a shift of positions 
within the "financial assets" item of the statements of financial position.  
The contributions underlying the Capital Increases in Kind and the Spin -off are each recognized in 
the pro forma statements of financial position of Siemens AG as of 1  April 2020, 0 .00 hours, with 
economic effect as of 1  April 2020. However, the contribution o f a (partial)  limited  partnership 
interest in Siemens Energy KG effected at book value against the granting of shares in Siemens 
Energy AG will merely result in a shift of positions within the "financial assets" item without 
resulting in any changes theret o. In the course of the Spin -off, Siemens AG will transfer, in addition 
to its remaining share in General Partner GmbH, its remaining interest in Siemens Energy KG to 
Siemens Energy AG. The portion of 55  % of the shares in Siemens Energy AG created by way of 
a capital increase of Siemens Energy AG as consideration for the above transfer will not be 
transferred to Siemens AG but to the shareholders. This results in a reduction in the financial assets 
of Siemens AG by EUR  12,678  million , corresponding to 62.5 1 % (55  % of approximately  87.98  % 
in the fixed capital of Siemens Energy KG) of the participation in Siemens Energy KG and the 
General Partner GmbH held by Siemens AG, which will not be offset by consideration; the Spin -
off will result in a reduction of e quity (retained earnings) of Siemens AG in a corresponding 
amount. Accordingly, the Spin -off results in a corresponding reduction of the statements of 
financial position by EUR  12,678  million . 
As a result of the Spin -off, the companies of the Future Siemen s Energy Group will no longer be 
considered subsidiaries of Siemens AG. As a consequence, in the pro forma statements of financial 
position as of 1  April 2020, the items "receivables from affiliated companies" and "liabilities to 
affiliated companies" will  be reduced by EUR  712 million  and EUR  6,400 million , respectively, 
and the items "receivables from long -term investees" and "liabilities to long -term investees" will 
be increased accordingly by EUR  712 million  and EUR  6,400 million , respectively, in each case as 
compared to the statements  of financial position as of 31  March 2020. The item "liabilities to long -
term investees" as of 1  April 2020 relates in particular to financing funds (in the form of cash pool 
credit balances of the Future Siemens Energy G roup Companies) in the amount of approximately 
EUR 6.2 billion. This item includes the amount of approximately EUR  4.1 billion, which will be 
repaid to the companies of the Future Siemens Group. It basically represents financing funds to 
repay existing lia bilities of the Future Siemens Energy Group and to settle purchase price 
obligations to Future Siemens Energy Group Companies for additional asset transfers in the future 
(see in this regard especially Chapter  V.1.e)).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  127 Since the remaining participation hel d by Siemens AG in Siemens Energy AG in the future is 
valued at cost in the statements of financial position of Siemens AG, any future changes in value 
are not taken into account, except for any possible subsequent increase in the purchase price for the 
24 % participation in Siemens Ltd., India (see immediately below), unless there is an impairment 
which would have to be reflected in the profit and loss.  
The pro forma statements of financial position do not reflect the further strengthening of the equity  
of Siemens Energy KG implemented by Siemens AG and SBI GmbH on 28  April 2020 in the 
amount of EUR  141 million  (see in this regard Chapter  VIII.1a)dd) above).  
As described above (see Chapter  VIII.1a)dd) above), adjustments (if any) of the purchase prices 
are not anticipated  The transfer of the 24  % participation in Siemens Ltd., India, to the Future 
Siemens Energy Group was concluded on 19 May 2020. A s a result of an increase in the share price 
of Siemens Ltd., India , the purchase price was increased  by approximately EUR  50 million . Based 
on the contractual obligation of Siemens AG (or SBI GmbH  on a pro rata  basis ), additional cash 
contributions in the amount of the purchase price increase are provided to Siemens Energy KG. As 
the purchase price for the 2 4 % participation in Siemens Ltd., India , was paid by  a Future Siemens 
Energy Group company  to Siemens AG, the amount of cash and cash equivalents at Siemens AG 
(including SBI GmbH) remain s unchanged , except for  transaction costs (taxes, bank charges ). The  
carrying amount  of the minority interest  recognized by Siemens AG for its investment in Siemens 
Energy AG is increased proportionally as a result of the subsequent cash  contribution . Taking into 
account the subsequent increase in the purchase price, Sieme ns AG's equity is likewise increased 
in accordance with the remaining minority participation held in Siemens Energy AG.

 Effects of the Transaction shown in the Statements of Financial Position  
As of 31  March 2020, Siemens Energy AG was not economically active yet, as the economic 
incorporation took place only as of 1  April 2020. As of 31  March 2020, Siemens Energy AG had 
no operating business of its own and did not hold any participations in oth er companies, either. In 
particular, it did not hold any interest in Siemens Energy KG, which already conducted the German 
Siemens Energy Business Operation at that point in time. Accordingly, its individual statements of 
financial position as of 31  March 2020, 24 .00 hours , only show the items "cash and cash 
equivalents" and "receivables from affiliated companies" in the amount of EUR  176 thousand 
within  total assets and "equity " in the same amount.  
The assets of the pro forma statement s of financial positi on as of 1  April 2020, 0 .00 hours , include  
the 100  % interest  in Siemens Ener gy KG and participation in General Partner GmbH.  In this 
context, it has been agreed in the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement with a view to the Spin -off 
Capital Increase that Sieme ns Energy AG will carry over book values in its individual financial 
statements  (HGB), which results in an increase in the "financial as sets" item in the amount of 
EUR  12,678  million .  
On the other hand, the underlying contribution agreement provides with respect to the Capital 
Increases in Kind that the new shares are to be issued at a minimum issue price of EUR  1.00 per 
Siemens Energy Share. A carryover of the book value for individual financial statements  purposes 
is not provided for in the contribution agreement. In the above pro forma statements of financial 
positi on of Siemens Energy AG as of 1  April 2020, the acquisition costs of the shares in Siemens 
Energy KG and its general partner that are contributed to Siemens Energy AG by way of the 
contributio n agreement have been assumed to be equal to the issue price of the shares newly created 
for that co ntribution in the amount of EUR  327 million . As a result, the total sum of the "financi al 
assets" item amounts to EUR  13,005 million . Recognition of the car rying amount or fair value of the 
shares contributed under the contribution agreement would have resulted in a higher amount for the 
item "Financial assets ". Stating a lower carrying amount for Siemens Energy KG in the " Financial 
assets" item of Siemens En ergy AG enables the latter to build up free reserves from withdrawals 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  129 out of its subsidiary Siemens Energy KG without thereby triggering any impairments of its Siemens 
Energy KG participation to be reflected in profit and loss. These free reserves would th en be 
available to Siemens Energy AG for example to make dividend payments or to repurchase shares. 
Furthermore, the "current assets" stated in the pro forma statements of financial position with an 
amount of EUR  176 thousand  are reduced to 0 because of th e disbursement made in connection 
with the mixed capital increase in kind. Siemens Energy AG includes a recognition under equity in 
the pro forma statements of financial position that corresponds to the amount of the recognitions 
on the assets side (EUR  13,005 million ). The increase in equity by EUR  13,005 million  results from 
the contributions of ( limited partnership) interests in Siemens Energy KG and General Partner 
GmbH in connection with the Capital Increases in Kind and from the Spin -off of the remaini ng 
participation in Siemens Energy KG and in General Partner GmbH.  
The pro forma statements of financial position do not reflect the further strengthening of the equity 
of Siemens Energy KG implemented by Siemens  AG and SBI  GmbH on 28 April 2020 in the 
amount of EUR  141 million  (see in this regard Chapter  VIII.1 .a)dd) above).  
Furthermore, the increase in the carrying amount of the investment held by Siemens Energy AG in 
Siemens Energy KG resulting from the additional contribution in cash  in the amount of 
approximately EUR 50 million  by Siemens AG (or by SBI GmbH on a pro rata  basis) and the 
resulting equity  increase of Siemens Energy AG in connection with the conclusion of the transfer 
of the 24  % participation in Siemens Ltd., India, on 19  Mai 2020 has no t been anticipated. This 
additional contribution in cash is the result of an increase in the share price of Siemens Ltd., India , 
and a consequent ly higher purchase price for the 24  % participation in Siemens Ltd., India.

 Effects of the Transaction shown in the Statements of Financial Position  
As the scope of consolidation for the consolidated financial statements of Siemens AG has not yet 
changed as a result of the Spin -off as of 31  March 2020, the transfer of assets and liabilities of 
Siemens AG pertaining to the German Siemens Energy  Business Operations to Siemens Energy 
KG and the contribution of the international Siemens Energy Business conducted so far by 
subsidiaries to Siemens Energy KG are not discernible as such in the consolidated statements of 
financial position as of 31  Marc h 2020.  
As a result of the Spin -off, the majority of the shares in Siemens Energy AG will be disposed of 
and, taking also into account the Deconsolidation Agreement entered into in connection with the 
Spin-off, Siemens AG will no longer exercise control ov er Siemens Energy AG, is wholly owned 
subsidiary Siemens Energy KG and the Siemens Energy Business; therefore, Siemens AG will 
cease to fully consolidate the Siemens Energy Business in its consolidated financial statements.  
The Siemens Energy Business has been derecognized from the pro forma consolidated statements 
of financial position as of 1  April 2020, 0 .00 hours. This results in a reduction of the item "assets 
classified as held for disposal" by EUR  41,222  million  and o f the item "liabilities associated with 
assets classified as held for disposal" by EUR  26,170  million . The 40  % participation in Shanghai 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  133 Electric Power Generation Equipment Co. LTD continue s to be recognized under "assets classified 
as held for disposal" because the transfer is not intended to occur until fiscal year 2021 (see, in this 
regard, also Chapter  V.1.f)).  
The pro forma consolidated statements of financial position reflect transactions between companies 
of the Future Siemens Group and companies of  the Future Siemens Energy Group which, 
previously, constituted group -internal transactions and were thus not shown in the consolidated 
half-year financial statements  as of 31  March 2020 because of the consolidation. Therefore, 
receivables and liabilities held by the remaining Siemens Group with respect to the Future Siemens 
Energy Group after the Spin -off are recognized in the pro forma consolidated statements of 
financial position. This has in particular the following effects:  
 The deconsolidation results in an increase in the items "other current financial assets" by 
EUR  1,084  million and "other current financial liabilities" by EUR  2,813  million . This is 
because, prior to the Spin -off taking effect, group -internal receivables and liabilities of 
companies of the Future Siemens Group against the Future Siemens Energy Group were 
eliminated by way of the consolidation and had, therefore, not been recognized under 
"other current financial assets" and "other current financial liabilities".  The financing 
provided  to the Future Siemens Energy Group in order to comply with purchase price 
obligations to Future Siemens Group Companies for additional asset transfers in the future 
(see, in particular, Chapter  V.1.d)) has been recognized in the pro forma statements of 
financial position as a payment already effected and, in the context of the acquisition, as 
repayment received.  
 Additionally, the deconsolidation  will result  in an increase in the items " other current 
financial assets" and " other financial assets" of a furth er EUR  287 million and EUR  460 
million , respectively,  and increase in the items "other current financial liabilities" and 
"other financial liabilities" of a  further EUR  213 million  and EUR  227 million , 
respectively,  from formerly consolidated hedging agreements , in particular regarding 
foreign currency risks between the Future Siemens Group and the Future Siemens Energy 
Group.  
 The asset and business relationships between companies of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group and companies of the Future Siemens G roup will be recognized in the same manner 
in which the asset and business relationships between unaffiliated third parties would be 
recognized. Trade receivables and trade payables to companies of the Future Siemens 
Energy Group are included in the statem ents of financial position under the corresponding 
items "trade and other receivables" and "trade payables", respectively. Some of the 
customers of the companies of the Future Siemens Group have objected to the transfer of 
their customer contracts to compa nies of the Future Siemens Energy Group. As a 
consequence, invoices for these customers will continue to be issued by companies of the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  134 Future Siemens Group and related proceeds will continue to be forwarded to companies of 
the Future Siemens Energy Group. The item "trade payables" includes positions resulting 
from this situation.  
 Provisions for litigation that continue to exist for the Future Siemens Group but will, 
economically, be passed on to companies of the Future Siemens Energy Group result in a 
repayment claim in the amount of EUR  53 million  against the Future Siemens Energy 
Group.  
 In addition, the deconsolidation will result in the retroactive accrual of previously group -
internal interim profits that had been eliminated by way of the consolidati on prior to the 
Spin-off taking effect. This results in an increase in investments accounted for using the 
equity method by EUR  49 million . 
According to IFRS, the remaining participation of 45% held by the Future Siemens Group in 
Siemens Energy AG is initi ally to be recognized under the item "investments accounted for using 
the equity method" at fair value ( beizulegender Zeitwert ). This fair value is to be determined at the 
time the Spin -off takes effect and, therefore, not yet known, which is why, for the purpose of these 
pro forma consolidated statements of financial position, the book value of the distribution  group 
(Abgangsgruppe ) is used. The relevant basis is the book value as stated in the statements of financial 
position of the Siemens Group as of 31  March 2020, taking into account the group -internal 
financing. This means that, in addition to the items "assets classified as held for disposal" 
(EUR  41,222  million ) and "liabilities associated with assets classified as held for disposal" 
(EUR  26,170  million) recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position of the 
Siemens Group, the receivables and liabilities eliminated as a result of the debt consolidation, in 
particular those from the group -internal financing (the balance shows a net asse t of EUR  2,325  
million  from the point of view of the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies) also have been 
taken into account in determining the book value of the distribution  group. The net book value of 
the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies therefore  amounts to EUR  17,377  million . 
As a result of the initial recognition of the 45  % participation in Siemens Energy AG, the item 
"investments accounted for using the equity method" will increase by EUR  7,819  million . The 
"equity" item will be reduced in the  amount of the book value of the Future Siemens Energy Group 
Companies disposed of This reduction will in part be compensated by the recognition of the 
remaining 45  % participation in Siemens Energy AG. As explained above, in lieu of the fair value, 
the pa rticipation will be valued for the purposes of the pro forma statements of financial position 
with a portion of the current book value of the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies, which 
means that the "equity" item will be reduced by a total of EUR  9,508 million . In the event that the 
fair value exceeds the book value, the equity reduction would be lower owing to the fact that the 
derecognized book value remains unchanged.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  135 The pro forma statements of financial position do not reflect the further strengthen ing of the equity  
of Siemens Energy KG implemented by Siemens AG and SBI GmbH on 28  April 2020 in the 
amount of EUR  141 million  (see in this regard Chapter  VIII.1a)dd) above). This strengthening 
measure results in a reduction of the item"other current  financial  assets" and in an increase of the 
value of the investment accounted for  using the equity method.  
The transfer of the 24  % participation in Siemens Ltd., India, to the Future Siemens Energy Group 
was concluded on 19 May 2020. A s a result of an i ncrease in the share price of Siemens Ltd., India , 
the purchase price was increased  by approximately EUR 50 million . Based on the contractual 
obligation of Siemens AG (or SBI GmbH  on a pro rata  basis ), additional cash contributions in the 
amount of the pur chase price increase are provided to Siemens Energy KG. As the purchase price 
for the 24  % participation in Siemens Ltd., India , is paid by  a Future Siemens Energy Group 
company  to Siemens AG, the amount of cash and cash equivalents at Siemens AG (includin g SBI 
GmbH) remain s unchanged , except for  transaction costs (taxes, bank charges ).  
As regards the effects of the Spin -off on the recoverability of the deferred tax assets, see 
Chapter  VIII.2.  
 Pro Forma Statements of Financial Position of the Future Siemens Energy Group 
(IFRS)  
 Overview of the relevant Statements of Financial Position  
The pro forma statements of financial position of the Future Siemens Energy Group is not based 
on the Siemens Group's consolidated half -year financial statements as of 31  March 2020 and the 
Siemens Group's pro forma consolidated financial statements as of 1  April 2020 but on the  
voluntarily prepared combined financial information of the Future Siemens Energy Group as of 
31 March 2020 (" Combined Financial Information ") whic h were prepared by the managing 
board of Siemens AG.  
The Combined Financial Information include enterprises and businesses that will directly or 
indirectly be controlled or held, as the case may be, by Siemens Energy AG after the Spin -off taking 
effect. T he Combined Financial Information of the Future Siemens Energy Group were prepared 
applying the same accounting principles and valuations that were used for preparing the financial 
information for the Siemens  Group's  consolidated financial statements ( predecessor accounting ). 
The levels at which the goodwill has been reviewed for impairment are consistent with the levels 
used in this context for purposes of the consolidated financial statements of Siemens AG. As 
regards the Carve -out of the Siemens Energy B usiness, it has been assumed, as it also has been 
assumed in the pro forma statements of financial position, that the individual steps that were not 
completed by 31  March 2020 became economically effective already as of 31  March 2020 (see 
Chapter  VIII.1.a) dd) above).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  136 However, there were deviations from these accounting principles and valuations to the extent that 
this was necessary to show the Future Siemens Energy Group as a group of companies  that is 
independent of the Future Siemens Group (see in this re gard, also Chapter  IX.2.). This applies 
especially to adjustments that were necessary in connection with Siemens Group's consolidated 
half-year financial statements, as the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies were recognized 
in these statements in accord ance with IFRS  5 under  "non -current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations". These adjustments had not been necessary for the purposes of the 
Combined Financial Information of the Future Siemens Energy Group because, from the point of 
view of Sie mens Energy AG as the future parent company of the Future Siemens Energy Group, 
IFRS  5 is not applicable  to the Combined Financial Information. Furthermore, employee programs 
and leasing arrangements agreed with Siemens AG are recognized  in accordance with  the relevant 
accounting standards applicable to the Future Siemens Energy Group as an independent group of 
companies. In addition, transactions entered into with Siemens AG and subsidiaries of Siemens AG 
that have so far not been shown in the consolidated  financial statements of Siemens AG due to the 
consolidation are not eliminated in the Combined Financial Information , but are  classified as 
transactions with related parties.  
For the se reasons, the values of the assets and liabilities shown in the pro fo rma statements of 
financial position of the Future Siemens Energy Group deviate from the values of the assets and 
liabilities of the Future Siemens Energy Companies as shown in the statements of financial position 
of the Siemens Group as of 31  March 2020. Accordingly, the representation  of the Future Siemens 
Energy Group in its pro forma statements of financial position is comparable tothe representation  
of the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies in the statements of financial position of the 
Siemens Group  as of 31  March 2020  only to a limited extent . 
The following overview contains the pro forma statements of financial position of the Future 
Siemens Energy Group after the Spin -off takes effect as of 1  April 2020, 0 .00 hours , on the basis 
of the pro forma assumptions explained in Chapter  VIII.1.a)dd) above.

 Effects of the Spin -off shown in the Pro Forma Statements of Financial Position  
The pro forma statements of financial position of the Future Siemens Energy Group show the assets 
and liabilities allocated to the newly formed F uture Siemens Energy Group (consisting of Siemens 
Energy AG and Siemens Energy KG as well as their respective direct and indirect subsidiaries) at 
the time the  the Spin -off takes effect. Since no material financial effects of the Spin -off and the 
preparato ry transactions on the financial situation of the Future Siemens Energy Group were 
identified, the pro forma statements of financial position generally correspond to the combined 
statements of financial position of the Future Siemens Energy Group as of 31 March 2020 (rounded 
to full EUR  million  amounts).  
The asset and business relationships between companies of the Future Siemens Energy Group and 
companies of the Future Siemens Group will be recognized in the same manner in which the asset 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  138 and business relationships between unaffiliated third parties would be recognized. Trade 
receivables and trade payables to companies of the Future Siemens Group are included in the items 
"receivables from the Future Siemens Group" and " payables  to the Future Siemens Gr oup", 
respectively. Some of the customers of the companies of the Future Siemens Group have objected 
to the transfer of their customer contracts to companies of the Future Siemens Energy Group. As a 
consequence, invoices for these customers will continue t o be issued by companies of the Future 
Siemens Group and related proceeds will continue to be forwarded to companies of the Future 
Siemens Energy Group. The item "receivables from the Future Siemens Group" includes positions 
resulting from this situation. The other receivables from and liabilities to companies of the Future 
Siemens Group will likewise be recognized under the items "receivables from the Future Siemens 
Group" and " payables  to the Future Siemens Group", respectively.  
The pro forma statements o f financial position do not reflect the further strengthening of the equity 
of Siemens Energy KG implemented by Siemens AG and SBI GmbH on 28 April 2020 in the 
amount of EUR  141 million  (see in this regard Chapter  VIII.1a)dd) above).This strengthening 
meas ure results in a reduction of the item " payables  to the Future Siemens Group" and an increase 
in the equity of the Future Siemens Energy Group by that amount.  
The participation in Siemens Ltd., India will be reflected in the pro forma statements of financi al 
position of the Future Siemens Energy Group as having been transferred at pro rata  book values 
because a group -internal transaction occurred prior to the Spin -off taking effect. The subsequent 
increase in the purchase price  in connection with the conclu sion of the transfer of 24  % of the shares 
in Siemens Ltd., India, on 19 May 2020 is therefore not relevant to this report.  
As regards the effects of the Spin -off on the recoverability of the deferred tax assets, see 
Chapter  VIII.2.  
2. Tax Effects of the Spin -off and of the Capital Increases in Kind  
The following statements  explain the material tax effects of the Spin -off (for more details on  the 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement see Chapter  XIII.1.) for Siemens AG, Siemens Energy AG, 
Siemens Energy KG and the Siemens Shareholders as well as  the material tax effects of the 
contributions ( for more details on  the contribution agreement see Chapter  XIII.2.) for Siemens AG, 
SBI GmbH, Sieme ns Energy AG and Siemens Energy KG.  
A comprehensive or full description of all conceivable tax aspects for each individual Siemens 
Shareholder is not possible because this depends on the shareholder's individual tax circumstances. 
The following description  also cannot substitute individual tax advice for the individual 
shareholder. Therefore, shareholders should consult with their tax advisors about the individual tax 
effects of the Spin -off. 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  139 The following description is based on the currently applicable Ge rman tax law and its interpretation 
by the courts and administrative directives. Provisions on taxes can change at any time even 
retroactively . Moreover, it cannot be ruled out  that the German tax authorities or courts may assess 
the situation  different ly than is described in this Chapter.  
The tax effects under foreign legal systems as well as under  potentially applicable treaties for the 
avoidance of double taxation, in particular the effects on events or transactions taxable under 
foreign tax laws, are not  explained below.  
 Effects of the Spin -off for Siemens AG  
The tax effects of the Spin -off for Siemens AG result from Section  15 and Section  19 of the German 
Transformation Tax Act ( Umwandlungssteuergesetz , "UmwStG "). 
Fiscal Transfer Effective Date within th e meaning of Section  2 (1) UmwStG is the day as of which 
the transferring entity must prepare the commercial closing  financial  statements  (handelsrechtliche 
Schlussbilanz ). This date is 31  March  2020, 24 .00 hours , or, if there is a postponement, the date t o 
be determined as described in Chapter  XIII.1.d). For Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG, income 
and assets are therefore to be determined – subject to a postponement – as if the transferred assets 
had been transferred to Siemens Energy AG with expiration o f 31 March 2020 . 
In the tax closing financial statements (steuerliche Schlussbilanz ), the transferred assets must be 
recognized at fair market value (Section  15 (1) sentence  1 in conjunction with Section  11 (1) 
sentence  1 UmwStG). As a result, any built-in gains  included in the assets and liabilities transferred 
will be shown  and will generally be subject to corporate income tax, plus solidarity surcharge, and 
trade tax (gain derived from the transfer , Übertragungsgewinn ). To the extent that the gain derive d 
from the transfer is allocable to Siemens Energy KG, the trade tax imposed thereon is payable by 
Siemens Energy KG and not by Siemens AG. To the extent that the gain derived from the transfer 
is allocable to shares in any other entity or association of whose payments form part of the 
recipient's income  within the meaning of Section  20 (1) no.  1 or no.  2 EStG, only 5  % of the gain 
will effectively be subject to corporate income  tax (plus solidarity surcharge ) and trade tax, whereas 
any loss incurred from t he transfer – to the extent allocable to such shares – will not be deductible 
for tax purposes; the same applies to such shares that belong to the jointly held assets of Siemens 
Energy KG.  
By way of derogation from the above, Section  15 (1) sentence  2 in c onjunction with Section  11 (2) 
UmwStG provides for the option – subject to certain conditions and upon application – to avoid 
showing built -in gains  by carrying o ver the book values. However, Siemens AG does not intend to 
file such an application. A carryo ver of the book value is inter alia  excluded if shares in Siemens 
AG and  / or Siemens Energy AG are sold within five years after the Fiscal Transfer Effective Date 
and the value of these shares represents more than 20  % of the shares in Siemens AG existing  prior 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  140 to the Spin -off taking effect. Compliance with this subsequent holding period ( Nachbehaltensfrist ) 
by listed  companies , most of whose  shares are in free float . cannot be planned  with legal certainty. 
Moreover, the transferred asset s should not inclu de any material built-in gains  that are subject to 
tax. 
At the level of Siemens AG, any losses that can be set off, any remaining loss carryforwards, 
negative income not compensated, any shortfalls that can be carried forward within the meaning of 
Section  10a of the German Trade Tax Act ( Gewerbesteuergesetz , "GewStG "), interest 
carryforwards within the meaning of Section  4h (1) sentence  5 EStG as well as any EBITDA 
carryforwards within the meaning of Section  4h (1) sentence  3 EStG will be reduced in the 
proportion in which the assets of Siemens AG are transferred to Siemens Energy  AG based on the 
fair market value (Section  15 (3) and Section  19 (2) UmwStG). According to the tax authorities, 
the ratio is usually identical to the spin -off key (Spaltungsverhätnis ) (margin no.  15.41 of the letter 
of the German Federal Ministry of Finance ( Bundesministerium der Finanzen  ("BMF ") of 
11 November 2011, Federal Tax Gazette (BStBl.) I 2011, 1314, referred to as " Reorganization 
Tax Decree "), which mean s the exchange ratio (Umtauschverhältnis ) within the meaning of 
Section  126 (1) no.  3 UmwG. In the present case, the Siemens Shareholders receive one Siemens 
Energy Share for every two Siemens Shares, with this allotment ratio not necessarily having to 
reflec t the actual value ratio. Therefore, the proportion of the reduced loss positions should also be 
determinable based on another allocation measure. The tax contribution account (steuerliches 
Einlagekonto ) of Siemens AG will be divided between  Siemens AG and  Siemens Energy AG 
(Section  29 (3) of the German Corporation Tax Act ( Körperschaftsteuergesetz  "KStG "). The 
allocation will be made based on the proportion of the transferred portion of the assets to the entire 
assets existing at Siemens AG prior to the tr ansfer. According to the tax authorities, the ratio is 
deduced  from the exchange ratio  in this case as well ; however, the fair market values have to be 
determined separately if the exchange ratio does not reflect the proportion of the asset portions 
(margi n no.  K17 of the Reorganization Tax Decree).  
 Effects of the Spin -off for Siemens Energy AG  
Siemens Energy AG will carry over  the transferred assets at the values contained in the tax closing 
financial statements of Siemens  AG (principle of using the same value ( Wertverknüpfung )). 
To that extent, Siemens Energy AG  enters into the position of Siemens AG under tax law with 
respect to the transferred assets. Losses that can be set off, any remaining loss carryforwards, 
negative income not compensated, shortfal ls that can be carried forward within the meaning of 
Section  10a GewStG, interest carryforwards within the meaning of Section  4h (1) sentence  5 EStG 
as well as any EBITDA carryforwards within the meaning of Section  4h (1) sentence  3 EStG of 
Siemens AG will  not be transferred to Siemens Energy  AG. The principles described above under 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  141 a) apply with regard to allocating the tax deposit account of Siemens AG to Siemens AG and 
Siemens Energy AG.  
 Effects of the Spin -off for Siemens Energy KG  
To the extent that a gain is derived from the transfer that is allocable to assets and liabilities of 
Siemens Energy KG, any trade tax payable on that gain will be owed by Siemens Energy KG 
(Section  7 sentence  2 GewStG (see above letter  a)). If trade tax deficits  of Siemens En ergy KG 
exist, as a result of the Spin -off such losses will be lost  pro rata  in accordance with the partial 
partnership interest transferred in the amount of 55  %. 
To the extent that German subsidiaries of Siemens Energy KG have corporate income tax 
carryf orwards and  / or trade tax deficits , these carryforwards and deficits  may be lost as a result of 
the Spin -off and its implementation pursuant to Section  8c KStG, unless the preconditions for the 
so-called corporate group clause ( Konzernklausel ) (Section  8c (1) sentence  4 KStG) or the so -
called built-in gains  clause ( Stille -Reserve -Klausel ) (Section  8c (1) sentence  5 KStG) are met.  
 Effects of the Spin -off for the Shareholders of Siemens  AG 
The tax effects of the Spin -off for Siemens  Shareholders  who are subj ect to unlimited tax liability 
in Germany arise from Section  15 (1) in conjunction with Section  13 UmwStG and Section  20 (4a) 
EStG.  
 Shares held as Business Assets  
(1) Generally, a Deemed Sale that is Subject to Tax  
In the case of shares in Siemens AG held as business assets, the tax consequences for the 
shareholders arise  from  Section  15 (1) in conjunction with Section  13 UmwStG. The shares 
in the transferring entity (Siemens AG) are accordingly considered to have be en sold on a 
pro rata  basis at fair market value and the shares replacing them in the receiving company 
(Siemens Energy AG) are deemed to have been acquired at that ( pro rata ) value (Section  13 
(1) UmwStG). The resulting profit or loss is the difference be tween the pro rata  book value 
and the pro rata  fair market value of the shares in Siemens AG at the time of registration 
of the Spin -off with the registers of companies of Siemens AG. To what extent built-in 
gains  or hidden liabilities of the shares will b e realized in this context has not conclusively 
been clarified; in this respect, presumably the same principles as for the allocation of the 
acquisition costs in the event of a tax -neutral carryover of the book value (see 
Chapter  VIII.2.d)aa)(3)) will appl y. 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  142 The above -mentioned statutory provisions create a fictitious (deemed) sale by the 
shareholder , which is subject to the general tax provisions on taxation of profits (or losses) 
from the sale of shares. In the case of a capital gain, the taxation depends  on whether the 
shareholder is a corporation, an individual enterprise or a commercial partnership.  
The Siemens Energy Shares to be granted to the Siemens Shareholders as consideration for 
the Spin -off are deemed to have been newly acquired for tax purpose s. The tax 
characteristics of the Siemens Shares held by the individual shareholder (for example 
holding periods, deferred obligations to recover value etc.), therefore, do not pass to the 
newly granted shares in Siemens Energy AG (the so -called "footstep theory" 
(Fußstapfentheorie ) does not appl y). 
(2) If applicable, Tax -Neutral Carryover of the Book Value  
Subject to the conditions set forth in Section  15 (1) sentence  2 in conjunction with 
Section  13 (2) UmwStG, by way of derogation from the above principle, a  shareholder may 
apply for a carryover of the book value, which means that no (taxable) capital gain will 
arise upon the Spin -off taking effect. In this context , the Siemens Energy Shares replace 
the Siemens Shares on a pro rata  basis for tax purposes (so -called "footstep theory" 
(Fußstapfentheorie )) This means that certain tax characteristics of the shares and/or of the 
shareholding in Siemens AG will pass on to the Siemens Energy Shares and are thus 
continued.  
For a carryover of the book value to be appli ed, Section  13 (2) UmwStG provides, inter 
alia, that both the Spin -off Assets and the asset s remaining with Siemens AG qualify as 
partial operations ( Teilbetrieb ) within the meaning of Section  15 (1) sentence  2 UmwStG 
(also referred to as a double partial operations requirement). Siemens AG and Siemens 
Energy AG believe that the intended Spin -off of 55  % of the partial partnership interest 
meets the double partial operations requirement. Against this background, the managing 
boards of Siemens  AG and Siemens  Energy  AG believe that – by way of derogation from 
the principle described above – the shareholders should be able, upon application, to 
recognize the Siemens Energy Shares with the pro rata  book value of the Siemens Shares, 
provided that the other precon ditions of Section  13 (2) UmwStG are met, i.e., in particular, 
if the law of the Federal Republic of Germany applicable to the taxation of a gain from the 
disposal of shares in Siemens Energy  AG is not excluded  or restricted.  
The application for a carryove r of the book values under Section  13 (2) UmwStG must be 
filed by the  individual  Siemens Shareholder with that shareholder 's competent tax office. 
The application need not be filed in a specific form, it must not be linked to conditions and 
it is irrevocab le. No specific deadline is prescribed for the application by law. There is no 
published statement by the tax administration on the subject of  the time of the  filing the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  143 application. In the view of Siemens AG, those Siemens  Shareholders who want to file an  
application for a carryover of the book value should file the application in a timely manner 
after the Spin -off takes effect. A taxable event would then only occur upon a subsequent 
sale of the shares in Siemens Energy AG (or other circumstances resulting  in a realization 
of value).  
(3) Allocation of the Acquisition Costs  
If the respective shareholder files an application for a carryover of the book values with 
regard to the Spin -off, the current acquisition costs for tax purposes or, as the case may be, 
the c urrent book values of the Siemens Shares will be split among the Siemens Shares on 
the one hand and the Siemens Energy Shares on the other  after the Spin -off. This allocation 
is relevant for example when determining future profits or losses from the sale o f Siemens 
Shares or Siemens Energy Shares. According to  the tax authorities, the exchange ratio of 
the shares under the Spin-off and Transfer agreement may, as a general rule, be used as a 
basis for this allocation; if this is not possible, the allocation may be made based on the 
proportion that the fair market values of the transferred portions of the assets bear to the 
(entire) assets existing prior to the Spin -off (cf. margin no. 15.43 of the Reorganization Tax 
Decree). In the present case, the Siemens S hareholders receive one Siemens Energy Share 
in exchange for every two Siemens Shares, with this allotment ratio not necessarily having 
to reflect the actual value ratio. The current acquisition costs of the Siemens Shares would 
thus have to be allocated a t a two -to-one ratio to the Siemens Shares and the Siemens 
Energy Shares. According to the view held in legal literature, however, the allocation must 
be based  either  on the ratio of the fair market value of the assets transferred to Siemens 
Energy AG to t he fair market value of the entire assets of Siemens AG prior to the Spin -
off, or on the fair market value of the shares in Siemens Energy AG and Siemens AG after 
the Spin -Off. An indication of the value ratios can insofar be derived from the stock 
exchang e prices of Siemens Energy AG and Siemens AG after the Spin -Off. For legal 
reasons, it was not possible for either Sie mens AG or Siemens Energy AG to  settle the 
question of the correct basis under tax law for allocating the acquisition costs or book 
values  of the individual  shareholder in advance with the tax authorities competent for the 
respective shareholders  in a binding manner . 
Even if the relevant shareholder does not apply for a carryover of the book value, the 
relevant bank or credit institution act ing as custodian will regularly not retain any 
withholding tax on capital gains with respect to the deemed sales transaction to be 
performed under tax law as a result of the Spin -off (Section  43 (2) sentence  3 EStG), 
possibly  subject to the precondition of  a declaration regarding the exemption from 
withholding tax deduction on capital gains ( cf. BMF letters of 18  January 2016, Federal 
Tax Gazette (BStBl.) I 2016, 85). In the event that withholding tax on capital gains is 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  144 nonetheless retained and deducted, s hareholders subject  to taxation  in Germany are 
generally entitled to claim a credit or refund of withholding tax on capital gains in the 
context of their individual tax assessment. Moreover, it cannot be ruled out  that the tax 
authorities will subsequently  claim payment of withholding tax on capital gains from the 
relevant shareholder. Therefore , the Siemens Shareholders should review whether the 
preconditions for the deduction of withholding tax on capital gains not being applied are 
met already prior to t he Spin -off taking effect and should arrange for the corresponding 
notifications being made to the bank or credit institution acting as custodian (e.g. by making 
appropriate declarations to the custodian bank).  
 Shares held as Private Assets  
(1) Shareholders wi thin the meaning of Section  17 EStG  
The provision in Section  13 UmwStG and the corresponding explanations under 
Chapter  aa) above also apply to shares held as private assets in the meaning of  Section  17 
EStG. S uch s hares exist if a shareholder or, in the c ase of a legal succession without 
consideration ( unentgeltliche Rechtsnachfolge ), any legal predecessors of such shareholder 
held, directly or indirectly, a participation of at least one (1)  % in the capital of Siemens 
AG at any point in time  during the last five years prior to the Spin -off (shareholder in the 
meaning of  Section  17 EStG).  
In this case , as above , a sale of the shares to Siemens AG is deemed to have occurred which 
is then subject to the general tax rules applicable to a disposal  of shares. If the individual 
shareholder files a request for continuation of the shareholder's acquisition costs, in 
deviation from the above principle, the shares in Siemens AG will not be deemed to have 
been sold pro rata  at fair market value. Therefore , no (taxable) capital gain will arise. In 
this case, the Siemens Energy Shares replace the Siemens Shares on a pro rata  basis for 
tax purposes ( so-called  "footstep theory" ( Fußstapfentheorie )). 
Shareholders within the meaning of Section  17 EStG do not generally have the option to 
avoid the deduction of withholding tax on capital gains pursuant to Section  43 (2) 
sentence  3 EStG described above in Chapter  aa). It cannot be ruled out that the custodian 
bank or credit institution will deduct and retain withhol ding tax on capital gains. These 
shareholders may be entitled, however, to assert a tax credit or a tax refund with respect to 
any withholding tax on capital gains paid in the course of the tax assessment procedure ( cf. 
BMF  letter of 16  December 2014, Fede ral Tax Gazette (BStBl.) I 2015, 24).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  145 (2) Shareholders within the meaning of Section  20 EStG  
To the extent that Siemens Shares are held as private assets and the shareholder does not 
meet the requirements under Section  17 EStG, the Spin -off is tax neutral, i.e ., no taxable 
capital gains are realized, in particular, if the law of the Federal Republic of Germany 
applicable to the taxation of a  gain from the disposal of Siemens Energy Shares is not 
excluded or restricted (Section  20 (4a) sentence 7 EStG). As a con sequence, no withholding 
tax on capital gains is to be retained and paid.  
No application for continuing the acquisition costs need be filed. According to  the tax 
authorities ( cf. margin no.  101 of the BMF  letter of 18  January 2016, Federal Tax Gazette 
(BStBl.) I 2016, 85) the exchange ratio is, as a general rule, to be used as basis for allocating 
the acquisition costs to Siemens Shares and Siemens Energy Shares according to the Spin-
off and Transfer agreement. In the present case, the Siemens Shareholders receive one 
Siemens Energy Share in exchange for every two Siemens Shares, with this allotment ratio 
not necessarily having to reflect the actual value ratio. Accordingly, the current acquisition 
costs of the Siemens Shares would have to be allocated at a two-to-one ratio to the Siemens 
Shares and the Siemens Energy Shares. If this allocation does not accurately reflect the 
value ratio of the share, the shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences , for example 
in any subsequent sales transactions. As th e paying agents, i.e. normally the custodian 
banks, are required to comply with the requirements imposed by the tax authorities, 
shareholders insisting on a deviating allocation ratio will presumably have to pursue this 
request in the individual tax assess ment procedure. An indication of the value ratios can 
insofar be derived from the stock exchange prices of Siemens Energy AG and Siemens AG 
after the Spin -Off. For legal reasons, it was not possible for either Siemens AG or Siemens 
Energy AG to settle the question of the correct basis under tax law for allocating the 
acquisition costs or book values of the individual  shareholder in advance with the tax 
authorities competent for the respective shareholders  in a binding manner . 
To the extent that the Siemens Shares were acquired prior to 1  January  2009 and, thus, in 
the meantime could be sold exempt from tax due to the expiration of the previously 
applicable "speculation period", this quality should pass to the Siemens Energy Shares 
granted upon the Spin -off based on a letter of the Federal Ministry of Finance of 18  January 
2016 (margin no.  100); based on this letter (margin no.  100a), any peak balancing paid 
upon an exchange of shares for shares acquired prior to 1  January  2009 will also 
presumably not be clas sified as a taxable dividend under Section  20 (4a) sentence  2 EStG , 
provided that the shares were no longer subject to taxation ( steuerentstrickt ) because of the 
expiration of the one -year holding period. In the view of the managing boards of Siemens 
AG an d Siemens Energy AG, this letter also applies to Section  20 (4a) sentence 7 EStG 
that is at issue here, which expands the scope of application of Section  20 (4a) sentence  1 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  146 EStG to spin -offs ( cf. also margin no.  115 of the BMF letter of 18  January 2016, Fe deral 
Tax Gazette (BStBl.) I 2016, 85).  
(3) Further Cases  
To the extent that Siemens Shareholders are not domiciled in Germany for tax purposes 
(tax foreigners) and the shares are subject to taxation in Germany (for example if they 
belong to a German permanent  establishment of the tax foreigner), the above principles 
described under Chapter  VIII.2.d)aa) apply accordingly.  
 To the extent that shareholders in Siemens AG are allocated so -called partial rights to 
shares in Siemens Energy AG on the occasion of the S pin-off (on this point see 
Chapter  VI.13.d)) and sell these partial rights, in view of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy 
AG this transaction will presumably be treated as a taxable sale of shares or, as the case 
may be, an acquisition of shares in Siemens Energy AG.  
 Future Distributions of Profit of Siemens Energy AG  
Pursuant to general taxation regulations, shareholders of Siemens Energy AG will be subject to 
taxation on any future distributions of profit  received . 
 Effects of the capital increases in kind for Siemens AG and SBI GmbH  
The tax consequences of the contributions on the basis of the contribution agreement, which is 
attached to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement as Annex  0.5.3, which in turn is attached to this 
report (see also Chapter  XIII.2.), for Siemens AG and SBI GmbH result from Sections  20 and 22 
Umw StG.  
Fiscal Transfer Effective Date (date of contribution) is 31  March 2020, 24 .00 hours, or, if there is 
a postponement, the date to be determined as described in Chapter  XIII.2.e) (Section  20 (5) 
sentence  1 in conjunction with (6) sentence 3 UmwStG). Thus, the Fiscal Transfer Effective Date 
of the contributions corresponds to the Fisca l Transfer Effective Date of the Spin -off (cf. 
Chapter  XIII.2.e)). For Siemens AG, SBI GmbH and Siemens Energy AG, income and assets are 
therefore to be determined – subject to a postponement – as if the transferred assets had been 
transferred to Siemens E nergy AG with expiration of 31  March 2020.  
Generally , Siemens Energy AG as receiving company has to recognize the contributed business 
assets at fair market value (Section  20 (2) sentence  1 UmwStG). As a result, any built-in gains  
included in the assets t ransferred will be disclosed and will generally be subject to corporate income 
tax, plus solidarity surcharge and trade tax. To the extent that the gain derived from the transfer is 
allocable to Siemens Energy KG, the trade tax imposed thereon is payable b y Siemens Energy KG 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  147 and not by Siemens AG and SBI GmbH. To the extent that the gain derived from the contribution 
is allocable to shares in any other corporate entity or association of individuals, whose payments  
form a  part of the recipient's income withi n the meaning of Section  20 (1) no.  1 or no.  2 EStG, only 
5 % of the gain will effectively be subject to corporate income (plus solidarity surcharge ) and trade 
tax, whereas any loss incurred from the transfer, to the extent allocable to such shares, will n ot be 
deductible for tax purposes; the same applies to such shares that belong to the jointly held assets of 
Siemens Energy KG.  
By way of derogation from the above, Section  20 (2) sentence  2 UmwStG provides for the option 
– subject to certain conditions an d upon application – to avoid showing  built-in gains by carrying 
over the book values. Siemens AG and SBI GmbH intend the contributions to be at book value.  
Accordingly, Siemens Energy AG is obliged to recognize the business assets received at book value 
for tax purposes and to submit the required book value -application (Section  20 (2) sentence  3 
UmwStG) in due time.  
Since Siemens AG and SBI GmbH (as transferring entities ) contribute their interests in Siemens 
Energy KG to Siemens Energy AG at book value, t he shares in Siemens Energy AG granted to 
Siemens AG and SBI GmbH as consideration for the contribution constitute so -called shares 
subject to a holding  period within the meaning of Section  22 (1) Umw StG. Insofar  as Siemens AG 
or SBI GmbH sell the shares subject to a holding  period within seven years after the date of 
contribution or insofar  as within this period the requirements of a substitute realization within the 
meaning of Section  22 (1) sentence  6 no.  1 to no. 6 UmwStG for the shares subject to a holding  
period are fulfilled  within this period , the gain derived from the respective contribution must be 
taxed retroactively in the financial year of the contribution (contribution gain I, 
Einbringungsgewinn  I). Corresponding corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge) would be 
incurred by Siemens AG or, as the case may be, SBI GmbH; the same applies for trade tax, as far 
as the gain derived from the contribution I is not allocable to Siemens Energy KG. Contri bution  
gain I is the amount by which the fair market value of the contributed business assets on the date 
of contribution, after deduction of the costs for the asset transfer, exceeds the value at which the 
receiving company recognized these contributed bu siness assets, reduced by one seventh for each 
year that has elapsed since the contribution date. The gain derived from contribution I is considered 
as subsequent acquisition costs of the shares received by Siemens AG or, as the case may be, SBI 
GmbH (cf. Section  22 (1) sentence  4 UmwStG).  
 Effects of the capital increases in kind for Siemens Energy AG and Siemens Energy 
KG 
Siemens Energy AG is obliged to recognize the business assets received at book value for tax 
purposes and to submit the required book va lue-application in due time. In respect of the business 
assets received it assumes the legal status of Siemens AG and SBI GmbH for tax purposes; their 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  148 periods of possession shall be credited to it (Section  23 (1) in conjunction with Sections  4 (2) 
sentence  3, 12 (3) first half sentence Um wStG).  
If Siemens Energy KG has trade tax deficits, these will be lost  as a result of the contributions on a 
pro rata  basis in accordance with the respective transferred partial partnership interest in the 
amount of 45  % in total.  
As far as due to a subsequent sale of the shares subject to a holding  period or the subsequent 
fulfillment of the requirements of a substitute realization there is a contribution gain  I 
(Einbringungsgewinn  I) (cf. above Chapter  VIII.2.e.)), which i s allocable to the assets of Siemens 
Energy KG, the trade tax imposed thereon is payable by Siemens Energy KG (Section  7 sentence  2 
GewStG). Siemens Energy AG can recognize the contribution gain in the financial year of the sales 
transaction of the shares subject to a blocking period or of the fulfillment of the requirements of a 
substitute realization as an increase amount with no effect on tax, among others, as far as Siemens 
AG or, as the case may be, SBI GmbH has paid the tax due on the contribution gai n and this has 
been proven by presentation of a certificate of the competent tax office (Section  23 (2) sentence  1 
UmwStG).  
 Contractual Provisions on the Payment of Taxes  
According to the provisions of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement and of the contrib ution 
agreement, which is attached to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement as Annex , Siemens AG shall 
bear the transfer taxes arising from the conclusion and implementation of the Spin -off and Transfer 
Agreement and of the contribution agreement on the leve l of Siemens  Energy  AG. The parties 
assume that no VAT arises from the conclusion and implementation of the Spin -off and Transfer 
Agreement and of the contribution agreement; should, contrary to the parties' assumption, VAT 
arise, Siemens Energy AG is only  obliged to pay an additional amount to Siemens AG to the extent 
that it has a corresponding right to deduct of input VAT . To the extent that VAT is imposed on 
Siemens Energy AG and Siemens Energy AG is not entitled to deduct input VAT , Siemens AG 
shall indemnify Siemens Energy AG from and against VAT and any interest thereon. In all other 
respects, each legal entity from which a tax has arisen or will arise bears the tax itself. In particular, 
the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement (including the Group Sepa ration Agreement) and the 
contribution agreement do not provide for general indemnification claims or compensation 
mechanisms between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG for the case that taxes are claimed 
subsequently. Thus, historic tax risks, in principle,  remain with the companies, in which they have 
arisen.  
Indemnification and compensation mechanisms are provided for only in certain exceptional cases, 
such as regards the direct or indirect participation in Siemens Energy AG remaining with 
Siemens  AG or SB I GmbH. In the event that tax holding periods that exist for such participations 
(so-called shares subject to a holding  period) are violated and as a result taxes are incurred at the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  149 level of the Future Siemens Group and/or the Future Siemens Energy Group (also see 
Chapter  VIII.2.e) and Chapter  VIII.2.f)), the parties have agreed that these taxes  generally  will have 
to be borne by the party causing the violation of the holding period, provided that offsetting tax 
benefits from topping up the book value in t he Future Siemens Energy Groupare to be set off or 
distributed.  
Other than that, Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG have agreed to cooperate comprehensively 
with regard to tax proceedings.  
3. Other Effects of the Spin -off  
 Protection of Creditors and Holders of  Special Rights  
The consequences of the Spin -off taking effect on the liability of Siemens  AG and Siemens 
Energy  AG are as follows:  
Pursuant to Section  133 (1) and  (3) UmwG, Siemens  AG is jointly and severally liable for the 
fulfilment of the liabilities t ransferred to Siemens Energy  AG if these liabilities become due within 
five years from the publication of  the registration of the Spin -off with the register of companies of 
Siemens  AG and if related claims against Siemens  AG are determined by a court or in  any other 
way stipulated by Section  133 UmwG or if enforcement measures of a court or a government 
authority are implemented or applied for. However, the fact that no liabilities are being directly 
spun off must be taken into account. Pursuant to Section  133 (1) and  (3) UmwG, Siemens 
Energy  AG is – vice versa  – jointly and severally liable for the satisfaction of liabilities remaining 
with Siemens  AG that were created prior to the Spin -off taking effect, if such liabilities become 
due within five years from the publication of the registration of the Spin -off with the register of 
companies of Siemens  AG and if related claims against Siemens Energy  AG are determined by a 
court or in any other way stipulated by Section  133 UmwG or if enforcement measures of a court 
or a government authority are implemented or applied for. As regards pension obligations under 
the German Company Pension Act ( Betriebsrentengesetz ), a prolonged liability period of ten years 
from  the publication of the registration of the Spin -off in the registers of companies of Siemens  AG 
applies.  
Furthermore, Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG are jointly and severally liable for complying 
with the duty to grant rights of equal value pursuant to Section  125 in conjunction with Section  23 
UmwG on obl igations pursuant to Section  23 UmwG. As of now, no such rights against 
Siemens  AG as transferring entity exist (see Chapter  XIII.1.k) regarding special rights in general 
and the interpretation of Section  23 UmwG).  
The provisions on the allocation of liabi lity stipulated in the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement apply 
in the internal relationship between Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG, i.e., in the event that 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  150 claims are asserted by third parties, the parties will indemnify each other from and against such 
claims (on this point see Chapter  XIII.1.h)). The managing boards of Siemens  AG and Siemens 
Energy  AG believe that, in view of the capital and financial position of both companies, the 
indemnification claims are recoverable.  
Pursuant to Sections  22, 125 sent ence 1, 133 (1) sentence  2 UmwG, creditors of Siemens  AG and 
Siemens Energy  AG can demand security for their claims from the company against which their 
respective claims are directed within a period of six months from the publication of  the registration 
of the Spin -off with the registers of companies of Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG, 
respectively. The prerequisite is that the creditors cannot obtain any satisfaction at the respective 
point in time and that their claims are notified in writing both with regard to the basis and the 
amount and that plausible proof is provided that the Spin -off endangers the fulfillment of their 
claims. The managing boards of Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG expect that no claims of 
creditors of Siemens  AG or Siemens Energy  AG will be jeopardized by the Spin -off taking effect 
and, accordingly, that no obligation to provide security will apply for Siemens  AG or Siemens 
Energy  AG under Sections  22, 125 sentence  1, 133  (1) sentence  2 UmwG. This applies with respect 
to Siemens En ergy AG in particular in view of the fact that the company will not be an operating 
company up until the Spin -off takes effect and does not have any third -party creditors.  
 Effects of the Spin -off on the Shares of Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG 
The Spin -off will have no effect on the listing of the shares of Siemens  AG on the stock exchange. 
After the Spin -off has taken effect, the shares of Siemens  AG will continue to be admitted to trading 
in the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and in the sub -segment of the Regulated 
Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with additional post -admission obligations (Prime 
Standard). The shares of Siemens  AG will be traded ex the Spin -Off on the first trading day of the 
shares of Siemens Energy  AG. 
The mana ging board of Siemens  AG expects that the Siemens Shares will continue to qualify for 
inclusion in the DAX30 and will thus remain in the DAX30. The same applies for the EURO 
STOXX  50 and MSCI World indices. It is further assumed that, after the Spin -off ta kes effect, the 
Siemens Energy Share will be included in the MDAX as of the next possible date over the course 
of the years 2020 and 2021. Furthermore, an inclusion in the DAX30 or other indexes is possible  
in the future . 
 Effects of the Spin -off on the Dividend Policy of Siemens  AG and Siemens 
Energy  AG 
The managing boards of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG have each examined for their 
companies how the Spin -off of the activities of the Siemens Energy Business will affect the amount 
of the net income av ailable for distribution and their dividend policy for future fiscal years.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  151 Siemens AG intends to propose a dividend policy for the following years with a distribution volume 
corresponding to 40  % to 60  % of the group profit after taxes attributable to the  shareholders of 
Siemens AG . For this purpose the relevant group profit may be adjusted for extraordinary non -cash 
effects  to take account of special circumstances . 
Subject to a minimum dividend of 4  % of the share capital pursuant to Section  254 AktG in c ase a 
net profit is reported in the annual financial statements of Siemens Energy AG, Siemens Energy 
AG will not make a dividend payment for the fiscal year 2020 . Otherwise, Siemens Energy  AG 
intends to follow a dividend policy with a distribution volume c orresponding to 40  % to 60  % of 
the group profit after taxes attributable to the shareholders of Siemens Energy  AG. For this purpose, 
this group profit may be adjusted for extraordinary non -cash effects. Generally, it is intended to 
finance the dividend di stribution out of the Free Cash Flow available to Siemens Energy  AG taking 
into account dividend distributions received from SGRE S.A.  
 Effects of the Spin -off on the Shareholders of Siemens AG  
All shareholders of Siemens  AG will continue to hold a participation in Siemens  AG in accordance 
with their present participation and will thus continue to participate in the remaining economic 
activities of the Future Siemens Group after the Spin -off takes effect. The number of shares issued 
by Siemens  AG wil l not change as a result of the Spin -off. The rights of Siemens  AG's shareholders 
will not be affected by the Spin -off, either. Likewise, the shareholder structure of Siemens  AG will 
not directly be affected by the Spin -off. 
All shareholders of Siemens  AG will receive as consideration for the transfer of the Spin -off Assets 
Siemens Energy Shares based on the allotment ratio and preserving the proportionate shareholdings 
(cf. Chapter  X.4.a) as regards the shareholder structure at Siemens Energy  AG after the Spin-off). 
One (1) Siemens Energy Share will be granted in exchange for two  (2) Siemens Shares. As a result, 
the Siemens Shareholders will directly hold a participation in the Siemens Energy Business. In 
relation to the entire capital stock of Siemens Ener gy AG, the participation ratio of each Siemens 
Shareholder in Siemens Energy  AG will be 45  % lower than such shareholder's participation ratio 
in Siemens  AG due to the (direct and indirect) participation of Siemens  AG in Siemens Energy  AG. 
As consequence, certain shareholder rights that shareholders were able to exercise at Siemens  AG 
based on the participation ratio might no longer be exercisable at Siemens Energy  AG because of 
the lower participation ratio.  
The amount of future dividends depends on the re levant dividend policy (see Chapter  VIII.3.c)).  
 Effects of the Spin -off on the External Financing  
The legal separation of the Siemens Energy Business will not directly affect the existing external 
financing of Siemens  AG. The Spin -off is taken into account  when agreeing on the syndicated loan 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  152 for the Future Siemens Energy Group ( cf. Chapter  V.3.a)) and thus also has  have no effects.  Nor 
does the Spin -off have any effect on the existing external financing of SGRE S.A.  
 Effects on the Guarantees provided and on Cash Management  
The Spin -off itself will generally have no direct effects on the existence of any guarantees, sureties 
and other securities provided to third parties. This applies in particular to guarantees, sureties and 
other securities provided by Fu ture Siemens Group Companies for obligations of the Siemens 
Energy Business. Any letters of comfort and other collateral arrangements provided for the benefit 
of banks, insurances and other financial institutions for credit lines, foreign currency, interes t rate 
and commodity price hedging derivatives as well as guarantee credit lines of Future Siemens 
Energy Group Companies are intended to be discharged by the Future Siemens Energy Group after 
the Spin -off takes effect by way of providing its own collatera l instruments (see Chapter  V.3.d)).  
The Spin -off as such will automatically result in the termination of the cash management system 
existing between Siemens Energy KG and other Future Siemens Energy Group Companies 
included therein on the one hand and Futu re Siemens Group Companies on the other hand, for more 
details see Chapter  V.3.a) and Chapter  V.3.b) as well as Chapter  V.3.c) for currency, interest and 
commodity price hedging derivatives.  
 Effect of the Spin -off on Compensation Programs and Employee Part icipation 
Programs  
Siemens  AG and further Siemens Group Companies have made, or will make on or before the 
effective date of the spin -off, various commitments to provide Siemens Shares to members of the 
managing board and employees of Siemens  AG, as well a s to members of corporate bodies and 
employees of Siemens Group Companies, including employees of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group, in the context of stock -based compensation programs or, as the case may be, employee 
participation programs.  
Upon the Spin -off taking effect, the rights under these stock entitlements granted to members of 
corporate bodies and employees of the Future Siemens Energy Group who leave the Siemens Group 
upon the Spin -off taking effect will be compensated for in cash. The costs of the  cash payments 
will generally be borne by the company of the Future Siemens Energy Group that is the obligor 
under the stock entitlements to the beneficiaries at the time the Spin -off takes effect. The amount 
of the respective cash payment is determined ba sed on a number of variable factors, including the 
closing price of the Siemens Share in Xetra on the closing date of the Spin -off, which means that 
the amount of cash payments cannot be finally determined at this point in time. Assuming that the 
amount of  stock entitlements remains unchanged as of 30  April 2020, that the closing price in Xetra 
of the Siemens Share will be EUR  90 and that the Spin -off takes effect on 25  September 2020, the 
cash payment amount would total approximately EUR  165 million . In ad dition, the costs for the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  153 cash payments of any additional commitments made to employees after 30  April 2020 would have 
to be added.  
Stock entitlements granted to other beneficiaries, members of corporate bodies or employees who 
do not leave the Siemens Gro up as consequence of the Spin -off will generally be adjusted. The 
adjustment is made by way of payment of a cash amount upon the relevant stock entitlement 
becoming due and shall preserve the economic value of the stock entitlements.  
Details of these adjus tments and/or the aforementioned cash payments are described in §  11 of the 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement (reference is made to §  11 of the Spin -off and Transfer 
Agreement as well as to the corresponding Annexes, which are attached to this Spin -off Repor t as 
Annex, as well as to the comprehensive explanation in Chapter  XIII.1.k) ). 
 Applicability of the Provisions on Transactions between Related Companies  
As regards the legal relationships between Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG, the corporate 
rules genera lly applicable to transactions between a stock corporation and its shareholders (and 
their respective affiliated companies) apply. Section  57 (3) AktG, which only permits the 
distribution of the unappropriated net income to the shareholders prior to the li quidation of a stock 
corporation, is understood – beyond its mere wording – that also hidden profit distributions 
(verdeckte Gewinnausschüttungen ) to shareholders are not permissible. Business relationships 
between a shareholder and a stock corporation on market terms (arm's length principle) are 
permissible; by contrast, not permissible are for example intended shifts of assets by way of 
transactions that are favorable for the shareholder and unfavorable for the stock corporation.  
As a result of the Spin -off of the majority holding in Siemens Energy KG to Siemens Energy  AG 
and the Deconsolidation  Agreement entered into (see Chapter  XIII.3.), the de facto  group 
(faktischer Konzern ) that existed up until that point in time between Siemens  AG and Siemens 
Energ y AG and that is subject to Sections  311 et seqq  AktG is terminated upon the Spin -off taking 
effect. The managing boards of Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG expect that, after the Spin -
off takes effect, Siemens  AG will no longer be able to exert a controll ing influence within the 
meaning of Section  17 AktG on Siemens Energy  AG. 
It is to be expected, however, that Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG will qualify as closely 
related companies for the purposes of international accounting standards and that the pro visions on 
related party transactions will apply. According to IAS  24.9 and  28.3, such a close relationship is 
deemed to exist between a company and an associated compan y on which the company can exert 
material influence. A holding of 20  % or more of the v oting rights  (directly or indirectly) will 
indicate material influence unless it can be clearly demonstrated otherwise (IAS  28.5). In view of 
the participation of (directly and indirectly) 34,1 % held by Siemens  AG in Siemens Energy  AG 
(without  the shares transferred to SPT  e.V.) the managing boards of Siemens  AG and Siemens 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  154 Energy  AG assume, despite the Deconsolidation  Agreement entered into, that such a material 
influence of Siemens  AG cannot be refuted. Material influence establishes a close r elationship in 
both directions. The subsidiaries and joint ventures of the Future Siemens Group are also deemed 
related companies of Siemens Energy  AG (IAS  24.9). From the perspective of the Future Siemens 
Group, for the purpose of determining a close rela tionship, the term associated company includes 
Siemens Energy  AG itself and its subsidiaries (IAS  24.12).  
Besides special disclosure requirements in the individual and consolidated financial statements of 
Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG (Section  285 no.  21 HGB and IAS  24.18), Sections  111a to 
c AktG also apply to both Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG. Pursuant thereto, related party 
transactions that exceed the materiality thresholds  defined in Section  111b AktG are to be presented 
to the supervisory board  for approval pursuant to Section  111b (1) AktG and must also be published 
immediately pursuant to Section  111c AktG.  
 Other Effects of the Spin -off 
Upon Siemens Energy  AG and the Future Siemens Energy Group leaving the group of companies 
of Siemens  AG at t he time the Spin -off takes effect, the privileges under corporate group law as 
between the Future Siemens Energy Group and the Future Siemens Group will end as well. This 
affects in particular group privileges under the KWG  and other regulations under supe rvisory law, 
as well as group privileges under antitrust law (as regards the loss of group privileges, see also 
Chapter  III.4., as regards joint venture agreements, see also Chapter  V.1.f) ). 
The loss of control of Siemens  AG over the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies that occurs 
as a result of the Spin -off and the conclusion of the Deconsolidation  Agreement may trigger 
termination rights, purchasing rights or other rights of the relevant contractual partner of joint 
venture agreements or other continuin g obligations based on change of control clauses.

Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  155 IX. The Future Siemens Group following the Spin -off  
1. Business Activities of the Future Siemens Group following the Spin -off 
With the Spin -off taking effect, the Siemens Gas and Power Business and the SGRE Bus iness 
(which together form the Siemens Energy Business) which so far belong to the Siemens Group will 
cease to belong to the Siemens Group. Transfers between the segments in the context of the Carve -
out were referenced in Chapter  III.2. above. The Future S iemens Group will continue to include 
the industrial businesses Digital Industries, Smart Infrastructure, Mobility and Siemens 
Healthineers (via a majority shareholding in Siemens Healthineers AG) (with regard to these 
business activities, see Chapter  II.3.). Furthermore, the additional activities within the service 
companies  SFS, Global Business Services, Real Estate Services as well as the Portfolio Companies 
will remain within the Sie mens Group. Moreover, the Future Siemens Group will hold a 
shareholding  in Siemens Energy  AG equal to 45  % of the capital stock of Siemens Energy AG 
(with regard to further intentions regarding this participation, see Chapter  I). Following 
effectiveness of the Spin -off, previous  relationships  between the business activities of the Future 
Siemens Energy Group and the Future Siemens Group will continue as described in Chapter  XI.  
The organizational structure of the Future Siemens Group is therefore as follows:

CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  156 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Siemens AG (Individual Financial 
Statement s) 
Until 31  December  2019, a part of the Siemens Energy Business was conducted directly by 
Siemens AG. Effective as of 1  January  2020, this part, together with certain participations, in 
particular the shares in SGRE S.A. held at the time by Siemens AG, were contributed to Siemens 
Energy KG (see Chapter  V.1.b)). Additional shares in SGRE S.A. , which Siemens AG had acquired 
in the meantime , were contributed to Siemens Energy KG in the context of the separation of the 
Local Siemens Energy Businesses (see Chapter  V.1.d)). Changes in the valuation of the contributed 
participations do not have an effect on the result of Siemens AG. In the ongoi ng fiscal year 2020 
up until the effectiveness of the contribution of the German Siemens Energy Business Operations 
as of 1  January 2020, Siemens AG realized revenue  of EUR  1.7 billion  from the Siemens Energy 
Business. The transferred activities have no lo nger been taken into account for revenue and result 
of Siemens AG on an individual financial statements level as from the effectiveness of the 
contribution. Likewise, no dividend payments from the participations contributed to Siemens 
Energy KG, in particu lar from the participation in SGRE S.A. (in the fiscal year 2019 dividend 
payments equal to EUR  5.3 million  from SGRE S.A. were received), have been taken into account 
based on the individual financial statements since that point in time.  
Following the Spi n-off taking effect, Siemens AG will no longer benefit in profits from withdrawals 
from Siemens Energy KG as the participation in Siemens Energy KG will transfer to Siemens 
Energy AG upon effectiveness of the Spin -off. Changes in the valuation of the inter est in Siemens 
Energy KG will no longer directly impact the results of Siemens AG. Given that Siemens AG will, 
following effectiveness of the Spin -off, directly hold a share of approximately  32.98  % in Siemens 
Energy AG, Siemens AG will receive  with effect  on income  potential dividend payments with an 
effect on the results in line with its participation as long as it directly holds shares in Siemens 
Energy AG. In addition, Siemens AG will participate indirectly in dividend payments of Siemens 
Energy AG via profit transfers from SBI  GmbH equal to the participation of SBI  GmbH in Siemens 
Energy  AG. Reductions of the value of the shares in Siemens Energy  AG retained by Siemens  AG 
and SBI  GmbH affect the results of both companies.  
Furthermore, the results from business relationships between Siemens AG and the Future Siemens 
Energy Group will impact the results of operations of Siemens AG  following the Spin -off taking 
effect . This refers in particular to profits from royalties  for the use of the brand "Siemens En ergy" 
and the results f rom mutual supply and services relationships, especially under service agreements 
to the extent concluded with Siemens AG. In addition, Siemens  AG will receive fees from the 
Future Siemens Energy Group Companies for guarantees, suret ies and other securities provided in 
favor  of the Siemens Energy Business and its business partners. Details on these business 
relationships are described in Chapter  XI.

Beginning with the first half -year 2020, the Siemens Energy Business is  no longer included in the 
continuing operations but as part of the discontinued operations in the Half -year Financial Report 
of the Siemens Group. Therefore, the results of the Siemens Energy Business ha ve no longer been 
taken into account in the results of the continuing operations of the Siemens Group. For the results 
of the discontinued operations in the Half -year Financial Report, the results of the Future Siemens 
Energy Group were taken into account as follows:

The Future Siemens Energy Group is still part of the consolidation of Siemens Group in the first 
half-year of the fiscal year 2020. Intra -group earnings and expenses were consolidated ; particularly 
because of this there is  a deviation between the figures for earnings and expenses for discontinued 
operations of the Siemens Gr oup and the financial figures describing the results of operations of 
the Future Siemens Energy Group (see Chapter  X.3.). As a result, earnings and expenses from 
discontinued operations of the Siemens Group are only to a limited extent comparable with the 
earnings and expenses of the Future Siemens Energy Group.  
Upon the Spin -off taking effect, no amounts of the Siemens Energy Business will be taken into 
account in the presented line items relating to discontinued operations in the group profit and loss 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  159 statements and the group cash flow statements of Siemens AG. The contribution from the Siemens 
Energy Business to the financial condition and results of operations of the Future Siemens Group 
in the same accounting period will cease . A remaining participation  of Siemens AG in Siemens 
Energy AG will be accounted for as an at equity investment . Effects on the results of operations of 
the Future Siemens Group from such participation result from the pro rata  accounting of profit and 
loss of Siemens Energy AG. If t he market value of the participation in Siemens Energy  AG were 
to fall permanently below the book value of the investment accounted for using the equity method, 
an impairment would have to be recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position of 
Siemens  AG in excess of the recognition of the pro rata  profit or loss of Siemens Energy  AG. 
Furthermore, the results from business relationships between Siemens AG and the Future Siemens 
Energy Group will impact the results of operations of Siemens AG upon effectiveness of the Spin -
off. This refers in particular to profits from royalties  for the use of the brand "Siemens Energy", the 
results from  mutual supply and services relationships, especially under service agreements and fees 
for continuing guaran tees, sureties and other securities provided by Future Siemens Group 
Companies in favor  of the Siemens Energy Business and its business partners. Details on these 
relationships are described in Chapter  XI. 
 Financing and Capital Structure of Siemens AG and the Future Siemens Group  
Aside from the repayment of loans of Siemens AG by companies of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group as described in Chapters  V.3.a) and XI.6.a), the managing board of Siemens AG does not 
anticipate any material effects of the Spin -off on the debt, the financing or the capital structure of 
Siemens AG or the Future Siemens Group.  
Siemens AG currently has good ratings  in the investment grade range, namely, "A1  / P-1 / outlook 
stable" at the rating agency Moody's Investors Service and "A+  / A-1+ / outlook stable" at the rating 
agency Standard & Poor's. The managing board of Siemens AG currently assumes that the Spin -
off should not have any influence on the existing ratings  of Siemens AG by these rating agencies.  
3. Legal Structure of Siemens AG  and the Future Siemens Group following the Spin -off 
 Shareholder Structure  
The shareholder structure of Siemens AG will not directly change due to the Spin -off of the 
activities of the Siemens Energy Business.  
 Articles of Association of Siemens AG  
The Spin -off does not require an amendment of the articles of association of Siemens AG. In 
particular, the capital stock of Siemens AG remains unchanged. A capital decrease is not required

et seqq. UmwG (please refer to Chapter  VIII.1 . for the accounting consequences of the Spin -off). 
Nor is an amendment of the statutory business purpose of Siemens AG required.  
 Composition of the Managing Board of Siemens AG  
Currently, Siemens AG has a managing board with five members, consisting of Joe Kaeser, Dr. 
Roland Busch, Klaus Helmrich, Cedrik Neike and Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas.  
Joe Kaeser will cease to be a member of the managing board of Siemens AG upon conclusion of 
the ordina ry annual general meeting on 3  February  2021 at the latest. Dr.  Roland Busch will 
become the chairman of the managing board.  
The following table provides a short summary of the areas of responsibility:

Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas  CFO  / Financial Director  
 Composition of the Supervisory Board of Siemens AG  
The MitbestG will remain to apply to the supervisory board of Siemens AG following the Spin -off. 
The supervisory board will consist of 20 members, at least 30  % out of whom will be women and 
at least out of whom 30  % will be men in accordance wi th Section  96 (2) AktG.  
As a result of the separation of the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies from the Siemens 
Group, employees of the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies lose their eligibility for election 
to the supervisory board of Siemens  AG an d leave the supervisory Board of Siemens  AG with the 
Spin-off taking effect. This concerns the member of the supervisory board of Siemens AG Robert 
Kensbock. It is intended to apply for the court appointment of a successor shortly after his exit (see 
also Chapter  XII.3.).  
 Compensation Programs and Employee Participation Programs  
Stock -based payment and employee participation programs for executives and employees who will 
continue to be employed in the Future Siemens Group after the Spin -off takes effect will be adjusted

service activities of the oil & gas division is to provide value -conserving, value -driving and 
value -adding services for the products, systems and solutions installed b y the Future 
Siemens Energy Group in order to ensure maximum reliability, availability and efficiency.  
In the oil & gas division , customer  segment s are distinguished between up -, mid - and 
downstream markets. Main customers in the upstream market are global, national and many 
independent oil and gas companies active in exploration, development and production. In 
midstream markets main customers inclu de LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas), transport and 
storage companies. In the downstream market , main customers are active in refining and 
petrochemistry. Further, the oil & gas division services a wide spectrum of customers in 
industries such as shipping, chemi cals industry, paper - and metal industry as well as global 
and regional EPC companies. Additionally, the customer base for services for decentralized

Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  166 (4) New Energy Business  
In a structure similar to start -ups, the New Energy Business offers innovative technologies 
for hydrogen and Power -to-x solutions through own value creation and cooperation with 
partners. The products and services can be integrated flexibly into energy value chains of 
other business fields of the Future Siemens Energy Group. These products and solutions 
will be complemented by a comprehensive service offering.  
The New Energy Business is sti ll in the process of being built . Therefore, as of yet 
customers mainly are operators of pilot installations. The future customer structure will 
depend on the future development of this new market.  
 The Segment SGRE  
With its majority stake of around 67  % in  SGRE S.A. the Future Siemens Energy Group will be 
strongly positioned in the  field of renewable energies, especially the  wind energy sector. The 
activities of the Segment SGRE focus on onshore and offshore wind turbines and services along 
the life cycle o f wind turbines.  Beyond its core activity of wind energy, SGRE is also active in 
other complementary fields of renewable energy, such as hybrid and storage technologies.  
The onshore products of the Segment SGRE focus on gear technology with a modular  desig n and 
flexible performance values aimed at optimal adaptation and maximization of energy yield at 
different locations in any wind conditions. The offshore product range of the Segment SGRE 
focuses on direct drive technology (as opposed to gear technology f or the onshore products), which 
is particularly suitable for demanding offshore conditions.  
The Segment SGRE operates a comprehensive service business, ranging from performance 
guarantees to services for extending the service lifetime of new or refurbishin g older wind turbines, 
the logistical support for the construction of offshore wind projects, services for rotor blades, to 
inspection diagnostics and maintenance service for its own and third -party wind turbines.  
The customers of the Segment SGRE are main ly utility companies , independent energy producers 
and project developers with local activities, which develop the project to sell it. Additional customer 
groups are, among others, financial investors, self -consumers as well as companies using renewable 
energy to meet their environmental targets.

 Value Chain  
 Research and Development  
The investments in research and development (" R&D ") of the Future Siemens Energy Group are 
crucial for future growth. The R&D activities of the Segment Gas and Power and the Segment 
SGRE are organized independently. In the Segment Gas and Power, R&D activities are located at 
the divisional level. In addition, the new energy business manages its R&D activities independently.  
Due to the increasing share of renewable energy, the tra nsmission division focuses on the 
development of products and solutions that help to increase the stability of electrical grids while 
improving the overall transmission capacity, quality, reliability as well as availability of the 
transmission networks. Th e generation division focuses on the development of new products and 
the improvement of existing ones. In addition to further improving turbine efficiency values , the 
focus is on operating gas turbines with novel fuels – among others with hydrogen. The oil  & gas 
division focuses on new development and enhancement of technologies contributing to 
decarbonization. For the fleet in service and other service activities, R&D activities focus on 
optimizing costs in the overall product lifetime and on measures to e xtend the lifetime of products.  
The New Energy Business aims to support the transition to a decarbonized world with 
electrochemical solutions. In order to further strengthen the position of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group as a technology leader in the fiel d of industrial hydrogen electroly zer systems, it is planned 
to expand the existing portfolio to a higher output range.  
R&D activities in the Segment SGRE in particular focus on the development of new wind turbine 
models and the related control software  and integration systems,  on optimizing the performance of 
components  and on digitization along the entire value chain . 
 Procurement  
The procurement in the Future Siemens Energy Group is managed globally and is organized 
according to material areas within the goods management. The procurement activities for SGRE 
are controlled by the independent SGRE organization.  
The main objective s of the Future Siemens Energy Group's procurement system are to introduce 
cutting -edge technologies from innovative suppliers i nto its portfolio, to secure competitive 
purchase prices and to support the profitable growth of its business.  
A joint agreement was concluded with the Future Siemens Group on purchasing pooling and 
purchasing services for selected raw materials and for g oods and service products.

2. Sustainability Strategy of the Future Siemens Energy Group  
Sustainability will be – as already in the Siemens Group ( see Chapter  II.4.) – a guiding  principle of 
the Future Siemens Energy Group and at the same time a key guiding principle within the business 
strategy. Siemens Energy AG will yearly publish "sustainability information" including detailed 
information regarding strategy, organization, initiatives, management systems, measures and goals 
of sustainable management.  
In the course of the Agenda 2030 of the United Nations (UN) 17 SDGs have been implemented in 
order to support a sustainable development worldwide. The op erations of the Future Siemens 
Energy Group will further contribute to the achievement of all 17 development goals, whereas the 
influence is biggest in the areas of affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), humane work and 
sustainable economic growth (SDG 8), i ndustry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9) as well as 
climate protection (SDG 13).  
3. Asset Position, Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Siemens  Energy  AG 
and the Future Siemens  Energy Group  after the Spin -off 
Presented below are the ass et position, financial condition and results of operations of Siemens 
Energy AG as well as the Future Siemens Energy Group upon the Spin -off taking effect. Before 
the Spin -off takes effect, the Future Siemens Energy Group does not yet exist and, therefore,  does 
not yet constitute a group according to IFRS  10. Nevertheless  but the Future Siemens Energy Group 
will be treated in this chapter for this period, as if it had already existed before the Spin -off took 
effect.  
Chapter  X.3.a) covers the asset position,  financial condition and results of operations of the 
Siemens Energy AG. Chapter  X.3.b) explains the asset position and financial condition of the 
Future Siemens Energy Group as of 31  March  2020. Chapter  X.3.c) then discusses the development 
of the Future Siemens Energy Group's results of operations in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 and in 
the first half of fiscal years 2020 and 2019. Finally, the effects of the Spin -off on the results of 
operations of the Future Siemens Energy Group are presented (Chapter  X.3.d)). 
The impact of the Spin -off on  the statement of  financial position of Siemens Energy AG and the 
Future Siemens Energy Group is shown in Chapter  VIII.1.  
The following information on the asset position, financial condition and results of operations of th e 
Future Siemens Energy Group for the half -years ending 31  March 2020 and 2019 is based on 
voluntarily prepared Combined Financial Information of Siemens Energy AG for the half -years 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  170 ending 31  March  2020 and 31  March  2019. For the fiscal years 2019 and 201 8 ending 
30 September , the information is  based on information taken from combined financial statement s 
("Combined Financial Statement s") for the fiscal  years 2017, 2018 and 2019. The Combined 
Financial Statement s have been prepared in accordance with  the IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union (EU). The Combined Financial Statement s for the fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 ending 
on 30  September w ere audited by Ernst  & Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, 
Stuttgart, and received an unqualified au dit opinion.  
Since the following statements are based on historical financial information, the the actual  asset 
position , financial condition and results of operations of Siemens Energy AG and the Future 
Siemens Energy Group will differ from the following presentation. In particular, this could 
significantly be affected by a change in the situation of the overall economy and the industries in 
which the Future Siemens Energy Group operates, for example in case of a continuing Covid -19 
pandemic . Furthermore, the following presentation does not take into account the development of 
the Siemens Energy Business after the end of the periods covered.  
The Combined Financial Statements  include enterprises and businesses that will directly or 
indirectly be controlled o r held, as the case may be, by the Siemens Energy AG after the Spin -off 
taking effect. The Combined Financial Statements  of the Future Siemens Energy Group were 
prepared applying the same accounting principles and valuations that were used for preparing th e 
financial information for the Siemens consolidated financial statements ( predecessor accounting ). 
The levels at which the goodwill has been reviewed for impairment are consistent with the levels 
used in this context for purposes of the consolidated finan cial statements of Siemens AG. As 
regards the Carve -out of the Siemens Energy Business, it has been assumed, as it also has been 
assumed in the pro forma statements of financial position, that the individual steps that were not 
completed by 31  March 2020 b ecame economically effective already as of 31  March 2020 (see 
Chapter  VIII.1.a)dd) above).  
However, there were deviations from these accounting principles and valuations to the extent that 
this was necessary to show the Future Siemens Energy Group as a group of companies  that is 
independent of the Future Siemens Group (see in this regard, also Chapter  IX.2.). This applies 
especially to adjustments that were necessary in connection with Siemens Group's consolidated 
half-year financial statements, as the Futu re Siemens Energy Group Companies were recognized 
in these statements in accordance with IFRS  5, "non -current assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations". These adjustments had not been necessary for the purposes of the Combined Financial 
Statements  of the Future Siemens Energy Group because, from the point of view of Siemens Energy 
AG as the future parent company of the Future Siemens Energy Group, IFRS  5 is not applicable  
for the Combined Financial Statements . Furthermore, employee programs and lea sing 
arrangements agreed with Siemens AG are shown in accordance with the relevant accounting 
standards applicable to the Future Siemens Energy Group as an independent group of companies. 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  171 In addition, transactions entered into with Siemens AG and subsidiar ies of Siemens AG that have 
so far not been shown in the consolidated financial statements of Siemens AG due to the 
consolidation are not eliminated in the Combined Financial Statements  and classified as 
transactions with related parties.  
The effects on ea rnings of deferred taxes resulting from the deferred transfers in the Carve -out of 
the Siemens Energy Business after 31  March  2020 (see Chapter  V.1.e)) are not anticipated in the 
Combined Financial Statement s. Additionally, standard  depreciation on buildin gs in the local 
Siemens Energy Business transferred after 31  March  2020 (see Chapter  V.1.e)) are not shown in 
the Combined Financial Statement s for materiality purposes.  
Among others for the reasons outlined above, the financial figures reported to describe the results 
of operations of the Future Siemens Energy Group differ from the income and expenses from 
discontinued operations in the Siemens Group (see Chapter  IX.2.). Accordingly, the income and 
expenses of the Future Siemens Energy Group are com parable with the income and expenses from 
discontinued operations in the Siemens Group only to a limited extent.  
 Asset Position, Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Siemens 
Energy AG (Individual Financial Statements)  
Apart from holding a m inority interest in Siemens Energy KG and the General Partner GmbH after 
the execution of the contribution agreement (which is annexed to the Spin -off and Transfer 
Agreement as Annex  0.5.3), Siemens Energy AG neither exercised nor continues to exercise any  
active business activities until the Spin -off becomes effective. It has therefore not yet generated 
any income and will not generate any income until the Spin -off takes effect (apart from income 
from cost reimbursements by the Siemens AG). In the fiscal y ears 2019 and 2018, it incurred 
relevant expenses only from services such as accounting, IT and the audit of its annual financial 
statements. Until the end of the fiscal year 2019, these costs were offset, where they lead to a net 
loss for the year, by los s absorption under a profit and loss transfer agreement. The profit and loss 
transfer agreement was terminated at the end of the fiscal year on 30  September  2019. In a cost 
transfer agreement, Siemens AG has undertaken to assume the costs incurred by Sieme ns Energy 
AG (i) for the preparation and auditing of financial statements until the Spin -off becomes effective 
and (ii) more detailed costs incurring in preparing and executing the Spin -off. This is intended to 
ensure that the net asset  position  of Siemens  Energy AG (apart from changes due to the capital 
increases in kind) do es not change until the Spin -off becomes effective. Financial income from the 
withdrawal of profits of Siemens Energy KG is not expected to be generated even after the 
execution of the contribution agreement until the Spin -off becomes effective, since Siemens AG 
has undertaken in §  6.2 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement to ensure that no withdrawals from 
Siemens Energy KG are made until the Spin -off becomes effective.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  172 Upon the Spin -off becoming effective, Siemens Energy AG will be the sole limited partner of 
Siemens Energy KG and will hold all shares in the General Partner GmbH as its sole general 
partner. Any withdrawals from Siemens Energy KG, which Siemens Energy AG receives, will lead 
to financial income for Siemens Energy AG in this structure. In addition, changes in the valuation 
of these participations may affect the asset position and results of operations of Siemens Energy 
AG. In the future, Siemens Energy AG will incur expens es for the remuneration of its managing 
board and supervisory board members, for tax payments, for financing drawn upon, and for its own 
holding organization. Furthermore, the future results of operations of Siemens Energy AG depend 
on the future developme nt of the Future Siemens Energy Group 's legal structure .

After the Spin -off, the future financing possibilities and financing costs of Siemens Energy AG and 
the Future Siemens Energy Group will be based exclusively on their own creditworthiness. The 
managing boards of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG are striving to achieve a credit worthiness 
with the defined capital structure that will qualify the Future Siemens Energy Group for an 
investment grade rating. The managing boards of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG are of the 
opinion that the Future Sieme ns Energy Group will thus be equipped with a capital structure that 
will enable the Future Siemens Energy Group to operate successfully on the market from the 
beginning. In the opinion of both managing boards, the aforementioned capital structure will 
provide the Future Siemens Energy Group with sufficient capital and liquidity in line with its 
business planning after the Spin -off takes effect.  
As of 31  March  2020, the net receivable  of the Future Siemens  Energy  Group from financing

(1) The item "Central items and reconciliation" includes certain business activities and topics that are not directly related to the reportable 
segments. These are Real Estate Services, expenses and income from pension -related topics not allocated to the segme nts as well as 
eliminations, treasury and other central topics to which the definition of Adjusted EBITA applies  
(2)Adjusted EBITA is the profit before the operating financial result, income taxes and amortization of intangible assets acquir ed in business 
combinations into which the financial result will be reintegrated.  
(3) Also includes results from "non-controlling interests ", in particular those in SGRE, in which Siemens Energy AG held 59  % in 2018 and 
2019 and currently holds 67  %. 
(1) Orders  
In 2019, the Future Siemens Energy Group achieved order  entries  of EUR  33,734  million . 
This was EUR  2,688  million  or nominal 8.7  % higher than the previous year's orders  of 
EUR  31,046  million  (2017: EUR  29,673  million ). In the Segment Gas and Power orders 
increased fro m EUR  19,283  million  in fiscal year 2018 (2017: EUR  21,029  million ) by 
EUR  1,904  million  or nominal 9.9  % to EUR  21,187  million . The new installations 
business of the divisions generation and oil & gas as well as the volume of large -scale 
orders increased compared with the previous year. The latter inter alia  include d an order 
for the generation division of about EUR  400 million  for a gas and steam turbine power 
plant including servicing in France, for the transmission division an order of more than 
EUR  400 million  for high -voltage direct -current transmission in Germany, an order of 
EUR  300 million  for a major project regarding grid connection of offshore wind farms in 
the United Kingdom and an order for the generation division of EUR  300 million  in the 
process solutions business in Brazil.  
In the Segment SGRE orders increased from EUR  11,875  million  in financial year 2018 
(2017: EUR  8,768  million ) by EUR  874 million  or 7.4  % to EUR  12,749  million  in 2019 
as a consequence of an increased volume of large -scale  orders in all businesses. This 
includes two major orders for offshore wind farms including servicing in Taiwan of 
EUR  2.3 billion  in total. Several large -scale orders in the onshore business strengthened 
the order intake in the American region. By contras t, orders in the region of Europe, CIS, 
Africa and the Middle East decreased sharply, due to the fact that, for the previous year, an 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  176 order for an offshore wind farm (including servicing)  in the United Kingdom  in the amount 
of EUR  1.3 billion  was included for that region.  
(2) Revenue Development  
In 2019, the Future Siemens Energy Group recognized revenue of EUR  28,797  million . 
This was EUR  774 million  or nominal 2.8  % higher than the previous year 's revenue. The 
increase was disproportionately highly driven by a significant increase in revenues in the 
Segment SGRE from EUR  9,122  million  (2017: EUR  7,922  million ) to EUR  10,227  
million , with strong growth in the offshore and service businesses as well as clear  growth 
in onshore business. By contrast, the revenue of the Segment Gas and Power declined 
slightly from EUR  18,982  million  in financial year 2018 (2017: EUR  22,228  million ) to 
EUR  18,709  million  in financial year 2019. In particular, the new installations business of 
the divisions generation and oil & gas s aw a decline compared with fiscal year 2018 as a 
result of the weak order intake in recent years. The transmission division's sales were 
slightly below the prior -year level, mainly due to the delayed award of major projects 
originally planned for fiscal ye ar 2018 in the high -voltage direct -current transmission 
market.  
(3) Adjusted EBITA  
The adjusted EBITA in fiscal year 2019 was EUR  1,025  million  and thus significant ly 
higher than the previous year's EUR  846 million  (2017: EUR  1,991  million ). The EBITA 
margin ( adjusted) was 3.6  % in fiscal year 2019 and 3.1  % in the previous year. The 
Segment Gas and Power reported an improved adjusted EBITA in the amount of EUR  589 
million  in contrast to the previous year's amount of EUR  440 million  (2017: EUR  1,703  
million ) despite declining sales. Gross profit increased slightly as project results improved 
in both the generation division and the transmission division. Both gross profit and 
functional costs were negatively impacted in 2018 by capacity adjustments in connection 
with personnel restructuring in the generation division, which were not recurring to the 
same extent in 2019. In addition, a significant decrease in research and development 
expenses was caused by an adjustment of capacities to lower revenue expectations. 
Impairment losses on investments accounted for using the equity method in 2018 were 
approximately offset by gains from the sale of two businesses in the generation and oil & 
gas divisions in 2018. In sum, the profit of the Segment Gas and Power in the fisc al year 
2019 was not as negatively impacted by expenses for personnel restructuring as it had been 
in the previous year. At the Segment SGRE, adjusted EBITA in the amount of EUR  481 
million  in fiscal year 2019 was approximately at the prior year level of E UR 478 million  
(2017: EUR  330 million ), as positive effects from improved productivity and higher sales 
revenues were partly offset by price declines and higher expenses for integration and 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  177 capacity adjustments (including personnel restructuring).  In total , the Siemens Energy  
Group's expenses for personnel restructuring amounted to EUR  280 million in 2019, 
EUR  452 million in 2018 and EUR  70 million in 2017.  
(4) Net Income  
The financial result and the depreciation and amortization remained at a stable level in the 
fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Nevertheless, despite the increase in adjusted EBITA, net 
income  in fiscal year 2019 at EUR  282 million  was clear ly lower than in the previous year 's 
profit of EUR  645 million  (2017: EUR  960 million ), mainly due to tax effects. In fiscal 
year 2018, the Future Siemens Energy Group recognized tax income in the amount of 
EUR  493 million . In addition to the tax rate differences in the variou s countries resulting 
mainly from the revaluation of tax items, especially from revaluation of deferred taxes in 
the course of the tax reform in the United States.  
Tax expense s amount to EUR  35 million  and net income  to EUR  282 million.  
(5) Free Cash Flow  
Free cash flow increased by EUR  796 million  to EUR  876 million  in fiscal year 2019 
(2018: EUR  80 million ; 2017: EUR  -121 million ). This is disproportionately high due to a 
reduction in receivables especially in the solutions and services business of the genera tion 
and transmission divisions of the Segment Gas and Power. In the reconciliation to the 
consolidated financial statements tax -induced cash outflows had a smaller effect in fiscal 
year 2019 than in the previous year.

(1) Sales Revenues  
In the first half of fiscal year 2020 , the Future Siemens Energy Group recognized revenue 
of EUR  13,152  million . This was EUR  221 million  or nominal 1.7  % lower than in the first 
half of fiscal year 2019 which was at EUR  13,373  million  (all financial information is 
unaudited). The decrease was  driven by a clear  decrease in revenues in the Segment SGRE, 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  178 particularly because of a decrease in the offshore business and adverse effects of the Covid -
19 pandemic . By contrast, revenues in the Segment Gas and Power moderately increased. 
The transmission  division saw a moderate increase while the generation division remained 
nearly on the previous year's level and the sales revenue of the division oil & gas decreased 
moderately.  
(2) Net income  
The operative business of the Future Siemens Energy Group had a negative profit 
contribution in the first half -year of 2020. The decline in earnings was primarily due to the 
development in the Segment SGRE. In particular , the onshore business recorded substantial  
adverse effects in connection with project delays in Nor thern Europe and challenges on the 
Indian market. Both was further exacerbated by the effects of the Covid -19 pandemic. 
Besides, the profit contribution of the offshore business declined, mainly due to the lower 
sales revenues. The Segment Gas and Power al so recorded a lower profit. The decisive 
factors were a less favorable mix of revenue and additional expenses in connection with 
the establishment as an independent company, e.g., royalties  for the brand "Siemens 
Energy". There were also adverse effects of  the Covid -19 pandemic . The previous year's 
result was also positively affected by a profit from the disposal of a participation . 
Furthermore, the development in the first half of fiscal year 2019 was influenced by 
positive effects from the progress of pro jects, which were not recorded in this amount in 
the first half of fiscal year 2020.  
In the first half of fiscal year 2020, the sum of the financial income and amorti sation 
improved substantially  compared to the first half of fiscal year 2019. Additionally , the 
Future Siemens Energy Group recorded a total tax expense in the amount of EUR  2 million , 
whereby opposing tax effects in the Segment SGRE and the Segment Gas and Power nearly 
offset each other. Nevertheless, in the first half of fiscal year 2020 net income declined 
sharply to EUR  -337 million  in contrast to a net income  in the amount of EUR  202 million  
in the first half of fiscal year 2019 (all financial information unaudited).  
 Effects of the Spin -off on Asset Position, Financial Condition and Results  of 
Operations of the Future Siemens Energy Group  
The impact of the Spin -off on the statement of financial position and financial conditions of the 
Future Siemens Energy Group is presented in Chapter VIII.1. Since the business activities of the 
Future Siem ens Energy Group do not change substantially due to the Spin -off, no significant effect 
on the presented results of operations, with the exception of the effects discussed below, is 
expected.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  179 Once the Spin -off becomes effective, the results of business rel ations between the Future Siemens 
Energy Group and the Future Siemens Group will have an impact on the results of operations of 
the Future Siemens Energy Group. This continues to include expenses for royalties  for the use of 
the brand "Siemens Energy" and further the results of mutual supply and service relationships, in 
particular from service agreements, as well as fees for continuing guarantees, sureties and other 
securities issued by the Future Siemens Group in favor of the Siemens Energy Business and i ts 
business partners. Details of these business relationships are presented in Chapter  XI. 
With the Spin -off, the companies of the Future Siemens Energy Group will no longer participate in 
the internal liquidity management and financing system of the Future Siemens Group. This also 
applies to the participation of the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies in the currency 
exchange, interest rate and commodity price risk management system of the Siemens Group (see 
also Chapter  V.3.c)). Thus, the future financing possibilities and costs of the Future Siemens 
Energy Group will be based exclusively on its own creditworthiness  and the costs for currency, 
interest and commodity price hedging transactions will depend on its own activities. Depending on 
the situation in the respective markets, this will result in different costs than in the past as part of 
Siemens Group.  
After the Spin -off, the board members and employees of the Future Siemens Energy Group will no 
longer be able to participate in the stock -based payment and employee participation programs of 
the Future Siemens Group. Employees leaving such p rograms will cause a one -time charge (not yet 
recognized expenses for "accelerated vesting") (see also Chapter  XIII.1.k)), which will be 
recognized in the income statement of the Future Siemens Energy Group.  
The Future Siemens Energy Group is currently pla nning to introduce its own stock -based or other 
incentive  and employee participation programs (see Chapter  X.3.j)) and in addition, the members 
of the managing board of Siemens Energy AG were promised various compensation programs (see 
Chapter  X.4.d)); any  expenses associated with this will have a negative impact on the Future 
Siemens Energy Group's results of operations after the Spin -off. At the same time, the expenses 
that the Future Siemens Energy Group has so far incurred  in connection with the partici pation in 
stock -based payment and employee participation programs of the Future Siemens Group will no 
longer be relevant . 
For information on the effects of the Spin -off on the recoverability of deferred tax assets, please 
refer to Chapter  VIII.2. Furthermo re, the recoverability of deferred tax assets will depend on the 
legal structure and future tax strategy of the Future Siemens Energy Group.  
For the costs of the Spin -off, please refer to Chapter  VI.17.

Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  180 4. Legal Structure of Siemens Energy  AG and the Future S iemens Energy Group Following 
the Spin -off 
 Shareholder  Structure  
Upon effectiveness of the Spin -off, Siemens  AG (directly and indirectly and including Siemens 
Energy Shares held by SPT e.V.) will be Siemens Energy  AG's major shareholder holding 45  % of 
the shares. Upon the Spin -Off taking effect, The remaining shares in Siemens Energy  AG will be 
held by the shareholders of Siemens  AG in the ratio of their shareholding in Siemens  AG, however, 
without taking into account any treasury shares belonging to Sieme ns AG. 
With regard to the entire capital stock of Siemens Energy  AG, the participation of each Siemens 
Shareholder in Siemens Energy  AG will be about  45 % lower compared to that respective 
shareholder's participation in Siemens  AG due to the (direct and in direct) stake of Siemens  AG. 
For example, a shareholder holding 10  % of the Siemens Shares will be granted 5.5  % of the 
Siemens Energy Shares. This may result in the effect that certain shareholder rights which due to 
the percentage of the participation he ld in Siemens  AG could be exercised there cannot be exercised 
in Siemens Energy  AG anymore (e.g., right to request the convocation of the shareholders' meeting 
or to request a supplement to the agenda ( Tagesordnungsergänzungsverlangen ), Section  122 (1) 
sentence  1 or (2) sentence  1 AktG, respectively, or the right to petition for the appointment of a 
special auditor ( Antrag auf Bestellung eines Sonderprüfers ), Section §  142 (2) sentence  1 AktG).  
Taking into account the share allocation ratio of 2:1, based on  the current WpHG voting rights 
notifications made towards Siemens  AG and considering any attribution of voting rights to be made 
under the WpHG, it is expected that BlackRock Inc., Wilmington, United States will meet or exceed 
the threshold of 3  % of the voting rights in Siemens Energy AG upon the Spin -off taking effect – 
subject to any changes in the actual shareholding structure in the meantime, including any such 
changes not notifiable under the WpHG.  
 Group Structure  
After the Spin -off takes effect, Si emens Energy AG will be the holding company of the Future 
Siemens Energy Group, which will comprise of all participations of the Siemens Energy Business 
(subject to the participations described under Chapter  III.2.c), Chapter  V.1.e) and Chapter  V.1.f.)).

 Managing Board of Siemens Energy AG  
The managing board of Siem ens Energy AG currently comprises of four members, i.e., Dr. -
Ing. Christian Bruch, Dr. -Ing. Jochen Eickholt, Maria Ferraro and Tim Oliver Holt.  The board 
members  Dr.-Ing. Jochen Eickholt and Tim Oliver Holt have been appointed by the supervisory 
board of Siemens Energy AG on 1  April 2020 for the period until the end of 30  September 2023. 
Dr.-Ing. Christian Bruch has been appointed with effect as of 1  May 2020 for the period until the 
end of 30  April 2025, and Maria Ferraro has been appointed with effect as  of 1 May 2020 for the 
period until the end of 30  September 2023. At the same time, Dr. -Ing. Christian Bruch was 
appointed as Chairman of the Managing Board and Chief Executive Officer. The following chart 
provides a short overview of the envisaged areas o f responsibility:

Maria Ferraro  Chief Financial Officer  
Tim Oliver Holt  Segment Manager Gas and Power; Segment Manager 
Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy  
Each member of the managing board has entered into a service agreement with Siemens Energy 
AG. Each member of the managing board has also been appointed as managing director of the 
General Partner GmbH (see Chapter  IV.2.) and receives remuneration from it. With a view to their 
positions at General Partner GmbH and the compensation granted therefor (regarding Tim Oliver 
Holt additionally also to his employment with Siemens  Energy  Inc.) and the compensation gra nted 
for it, no remuneration has been or will be paid by Siemens Energy AG under a contract of 
employment for managing board members until the Spin -off takes effect. For the period after the 
Spin-off takes effect, it is planned that the members of the mana ging board will receive 
compensation from Siemens Energy AG for their position as members of the managing board of 
Siemens Energy AG  for the first time . It is intended that their work as managing directors of the 
General Partner GmbH shall be compensated b y the managing board remuneration born by Siemens 
Energy AG from the Spin -off taking effect; as a consequence , the members of the managing board 
from this time on do  not receive an additional remuneration for their work as managing directors 
of the General  Partner GmbH.  
The exact arrangement of this compensation system of the managing board members by 
Siemens  Energy AG will comply with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance 
Codex as published in the Federal Gazette on 20  March 2020 (" DCGK "). Subject to a resolution 
by the supervisory board of Siemens Energy AG, the compensation system shall be structured as 
follows : 
The compensation for the members of the managing board is comprised of fixed and variable 
elements.  
The fixed, non-performance -related compensation comprises a fixed basic salary, which is paid in 
12 monthly instalments, as well as fringe benefits such as a company car, insurance allowances, 
and cost coverage for medical check -ups. In addition, the supervisory boar d decides on a yearly 
basis on a subsidy to the managing board members' pensions. Such subsidy may, at the sole 
discretion of the supervisory board, either be contributed towards a defined contribution pension 
plan ( beitragsorientierte Altersversorgung ) or be paid out in cash by way of a so -called "pension 
substitute". The value of such fringe benefits must not exceed a specific maximum as determined 
by the supervisory board in relation to the base salary. The basic compensation for the fiscal year 
2021 amo unts for Dr. -Ing. Christian Bruch to EUR  1,440,000  and for Dr. -Ing. Jochen Eickholt, 
Maria Ferraro and Tim Oliver Holt to EUR  720,000  respectively.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  186 The variable, performance -related remuneration of the members of the managing board rewards 
performance and,  with its short - and long -term components, supports the sustainable and value -
creating development of the company. It consists of short -term variable remuneration in the form 
of a bonus and long -term variable remuneration in the form of stock awards.  
 The s hort-term bonus honors the contribution to the operational implementation of the 
company's business strategy in a specific fiscal year. This contribution is measured by three 
equally weighted components: Return on capital employed, earnings margin (i.e. ad justed 
margin of the earnings before interest, taxes & amortization), and individual targets being 
of either financial or non -financial nature. For those individual targets, the supervisory 
board defines two to four focus criteria at the beginning of each fiscal year. The degree of 
target achievement may range from 0  % to 150  %. The degree of overall target achievement 
corresponds to the average of the degrees of target achievement of the three individual 
components. In the event of an overall target achiev ement of 100  %, the bonus to be granted 
in cash corresponds to the target amount. In the fiscal year 2021 , this amounts for Dr. -Ing. 
Christian Bruch to EUR  1,440,000  and for Dr. -Ing. Jochen Eickholt , Maria Ferraro and 
Tim Ol iver Holt to EUR  720,000  respect ively.  
 The long -term stock awards set incentives for the sustainable development of the business, 
by measuring  the achievement of financial and non -financial targets over a four -year 
period. A specific target amount is set for each member of the managing board. The specific 
target amount for Dr. -Ing. Christian Bruch is EUR  1,920,000  and EUR  960,000  for 
Dr.-Ing. Jochen Eickholt , Maria Ferraro and Tim Oliver Holt , respectively. This target 
amount is multiplied in each case by a provisional maximum target achievement rate of 
200 %. For this amount, each member of the managing board is yearly, for the first time in 
the fiscal year 2021, granted  forfeitable stock awards , the specific number of which is 
calculated on the basis of the share price on the grant date , less  discounted estimated 
dividend s during the vesting period. After a vesting period of four years, each m anaging 
board member will be granted one Siemens Energy Share for each stock award, whereby 
the number of stock awards finally granted depends on the actual achievement of the 
following targets  during the assessment period : Total shareholder return of Siem ens Energy 
AG Shares plus paid dividends  compared to competitors, i.e. change in the stock exchange 
price of the Siemens Energy shares in comparison to the change in value of comparative 
indices  (40 %), earnings per share measured against previously set ta rgets (40  %) and 
achievement of sustainability targets according to a specific Environmental, Social & 
Governance criteria (20  %). The degree of target achievement of the individual 
components may range from 0  % to 200  %. The overall target achievement cor responds to 
the weighted average target achievement of the individual components. If the actual degree 
of overall target achievement is less than 200  % after the four -year vesting period, a 
corresponding portion of the stock awards lapses without replaceme nt and a smaller 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  187 number of shares is allocated . The Siemens Energy Shares allocated at the end of the 
vesting period are limited to 250  % of the target amount. Any excess stock awards will 
lapse without replacement. If commitments to receive shares in Siem ens AG without an 
additional payment after the expiration of a vesting period (stock awards) have been or will 
be made to the members of the managing board of Siemens Energy AG for the fiscal year 
in which the spin -off takes effect, these commitments will expire without replacement upon 
the spin -off taking effect. If commitments to receive shares in Siemens Energy AG without 
an additional payment after the expiration of a vesting period (stock awards) have been or 
will be made to the members of the managing  board of Siemens Energy AG for a fiscal 
year in which the spin -off will not yet take effect, such commitments will expire at the end 
of the fiscal year without replacement.  
Both the bonus and the stock awards shall be subject to penalty ( malus ) and clawback provisions 
that allow variable remuneration which can be reduced or reclaimed under certain conditions, e.g. 
in the event of a determined compliance violation.  
To ensure the long -term and sustainable focus of the compensation , the proportion of th e long -term 
variable compensation significantly exceeds the share of the short -term variable compensation. If 
targets are achieved at 100  %, the share of basic compensation (i.e. fixed salary excluding fringe 
benefits and pension contributions) is approxim ately 30  %, short -term variable remuneration 
approximately 30  % and long -term variable remuneration 40  %. Each component is limited with 
regard to the maximum income. The maximum total remuneration of each member of the managing 
board is equal to the sum o f the maximum amount of all compensation components for a respective 
fiscal year, the amount of which will be determined by the supervisory board on a yearly basis.  
The members of the managing board of Siemens Energy AG were additionally promised a spin -off 
incentive by the General Partner GmbH. For details of this incentive , see Chapter  XIII.1.l).  
 Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy  AG 
It is envisaged that the shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG increases the size of the 
supervisory board to ten sea ts by way of change of the articles of association still before the Spin -
off takes effect, and that, with effect as of the effectiveness of the Spin -off, the shareholders' 
meeting of Siemens Energy AG appoints the following persons as members of the superv isory 
board:  
 Dr. Christine Bortenlänger,  
 Sigmar Gabriel,  
 Geisha Jimenez Williams,  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  188  Joe Kaeser,  
 Dr. Hubert Lienhard,  
 Hildegard Müller,  
 Laurence Mulliez,  
 Matthias Rebellius,  
 Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas and 
 Randy Zwirn.  
Of the supervisory board members mentioned above , Joe Kaeser (CEO of Siemens AG), Prof. Dr. 
Ralf P. Thomas (CFO of Siemens AG) and Matthias Rebellius (COO Smart Infrastructure)  are 
employed by the Siemens Group . It is planned to appoint Joe Kaeser as chairman of the supervisory 
board.  
Upon the Spin -off taking effect, Siemens Energy AG as controlling entity of the Future Siemens 
Energy Group will constitute a supervisory board subject to parity co -determination pursuant to the 
provisions of the MitbestG. The managing board of Siemens Energy AG will i nitiate so -called 
status proceedings ( Statusverfahren ) pursuant to Sections  97 et seqq.  AktG. Since Siemens Energy 
AG and the subordinated group companies, from the Spin -off taking effect, will generally employ 
more than 20,000 employees in German business es pursuant to the provisions of the MitbestG, 
from this time onwards pursuant to Section  7 (1) sentence  1 no.  3 MitbestG, the supervisory board 
of Siemens Energy  AG must be composed of ten supervisory board members each of the 
shareholders and the employe es (pursuant to the provisions of the MitbestG, of the supervisory 
board members of the employees, seven will be employees of the company and three will be 
representatives of the unions represented in the Siemens Energy Group Companies).  
Even before the Sp in-off takes effect, the shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG will resolve 
an amendment of the articles of association for the formation of a supervisory board pursuant to 
the provisions of the MitbestG. This amendment of the articles of association is only to be filed for 
registration with the register of companies upon the effective conclusion of the status proceedings 
(Statusverfahren ). To ensure a seamless occupancy of the supervisory board in any case, already 
before the Spin -off taking effect, t he shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG will appoint ten 
shareholders' representatives of the co -determined supervisory board of Siemens  Energy AG 
subject to the condition precedent of the registration of the amendment of the articles of association 
with the register of companies. These will be the same persons who were already elected as 
supervisory board members.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  189 The employees' representatives shall be appointed by the court pursuant to Section  104 AktG as 
promptly as possible following the registra tion of the amendment of the articles of association with 
the register of companies . 
It is envisaged that, upon the Spin -off taking effect, the supervisory board of Siemens Energy AG 
will issue rules of procedure taking into account, among other things, th e recommendations of the 
DCGK.  
The formation of committees exceeding the statutory minimum requirements is at the discretion of 
the future supervisory board. The members of the managing boards of both Siemens AG and 
Siemens Energy AG expect that the future  supervisory board of Siemens Energy AG will not only 
take into account statutory requirements, but also the recommendations of the DCGK. According 
to current considerations, the following committees should be formed:  
 Presumably, the supervisory board will  elect from among its members an executive 
committee ( Aufsichtsratspräsidium ), which will also be assigned with the tasks of a 
personnel committee ( Personalausschuss ). The executive committee shall also be 
responsible for managing board matters and prepare  supervisory board resolutions on the 
compensation of the managing board. The tasks of the executive committee will be defined 
by the rules of procedure of the supervisory board.  
 Furthermore, an audit committee ( Prüfungsausschuss ) will be formed. Presumabl y, the 
tasks of the audit committee will predominantly be matters of accounting and audit, 
monitoring of governance functions (internal control system, risk management, internal 
audit and compliance) as well as the preparation of respective resolutions of the supervisory 
board.  
 In addition, a nomination committee ( Nominierungsausschuss ) will be formed, which will 
be responsible for suggesting suitable candidates to the supervisory board for its election 
proposals to the shareholders' meeting for election to  the supervisory board.  
 Furthermore, an Innovation and Finance Committee ( Innovations - und Finanzausschuss ) 
is to be set up. In addition to discussing the company's innovation strategy, the Innovation 
and Finance Committee is expected to prepare the negoti ations and resolutions of the 
supervisory board on the financial situation and resources of the company as well as on 
investments in property, plant and equipment and financial measures. In addition, it will 
presumably decide in place of the supervisory bo ard on the approval of transactions and 
measures requiring approval below a certain threshold . 
 Presumably, a separate committee will be formed for resolutions pursuant to Section  111b 
Paragraph  1 AktG (approval of related party transactions by the supervis ory board).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  190  After termination of the status proceedings, the supervisory board of Siemens Energy AG 
will also form a conciliation committee within the meaning of Section  27 (3) MitbestG.  
 Statutory  Auditor  
Ernst  & Young  GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,  Stuttgart, Germany was appointed as 
statutory  auditor ( Abschlussprüfer ) and group auditor ( Konzernabschlussprüfer ) for the fiscal year 
2020 and as auditor ( Prüfer ) for a potential audit review ( prüferische Durchsicht ) of the interim 
financial report ( Zwis chenfinanzbericht ) for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021.  
 Authorized Capital  
It is intended that the future articles of association of Siemens Energy  AG provide for an 
authorization of the managing board of Siemens Energy AG to increase the capital  stock of the 
company, with the consent of the supervisory board, on one or more occasions until the end of 
31 July 2025 , by issuing new registered shares against contribution in cash or in kind up to a 
maximum amount of EUR  363,322,596  ("Authorized Capital " – Genehmigtes Kapital ). 
The authorized capital of Siemens Energy AG is intended to be resolved by the shareholders' 
meeting of Siemens Energy AG still prior to the Spin -off taking effect. The resolution shall only 
come into force when the Spin -Off Capital Increase becomes effective. The complete wording of 
the authorized capital is as part of the future articles of association of Siemens Energy AG attached 
to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement as Annex  13.1. The Spin -off and Transfer Agreement is 
attached to this report. The provisions can be summarized as follows:  
The new shares issued from authorized capital participate in profits from the beginning of the fiscal 
year in which they are issued. To the extent permitted by law, the managing board ma y, with the 
consent of the supervisory board, determine, with the exception of the provisions of Section  60 (2) 
AktG, that the new shares shall participate in profits from the beginning of a fiscal year which has 
already expired and for which, at the time of their issue, no resolution by the shareholders' meeting 
on the appropriation of the balance sheet profit has yet been adopted.  
As a general rule, the shareholders of Siemens Energy AG are entitled to subscription rights under 
statutory law in case the p roposed authorized capital is utilized. In addition to an issuing of the new 
shares directly to the shareholders, the authorized capital shall provide for the possibility to have 
the new shares assumed by credit institutions or by equivalent enterprises pu rsuant to Section  186 
(5) sentence  1 AktG, subject to the obligation to offer the shares to the shareholders of Siemens 
Energy AG for subscription. The use of credit institutions or such equivalent enterprises pursuant 
to Section  186 (5) sentence  1 AktG as  intermediaries merely serves the purpose of facilitating the 
technical processing of the share issue.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  191 The authorization shall provide for the following exceptions from the subscription rights of the 
shareholders of Siemens Energy AG:  
The managing board of  Siemens Energy AG shall be authorized, subject to the consent of the 
supervisory board, to exclude the shareholders' subscription rights to grant employee shares 
(Belegschaftsaktien ) to employees of the Siemens Energy AG  and its affiliated companies. The 
new shares may also be issued through a credit institution or a company operating in accordance 
with Section  53 (1) sentence  1 or Section  53b (1) sentence  1 or (7)  KWG, which initially acquires 
these shares, which are ultimately to be offered exclusively t o employees of Siemens Energy AG 
and its affiliated companies. To the extent permitted by law, the employee shares may also be issued 
in such a way that the contribution to be made to them is covered by that part of the net income for 
the year which the ma naging board and supervisory board could allocate to other revenue reserves 
in accordance with Section  58 (2)  AktG. The issuing of employee shares to employees is an 
important instrument for employee retention and employee motivation. At the same time, the  
assumption of joint responsibility is encouraged.  
The managing board of Siemens Energy AG is also to be authorized, with the approval of the 
supervisory board, to exclude the subscription right for the compensation of fractional amounts. 
This facilitates the utilization of the authorization by round amounts and simplifies the technical 
processing of the shareholders' subscription rights.  
Furthermore, the managing board of Siemens Energy AG is to be authorized, with the approval of 
the supervisory board, to  exclude the shareholders' subscription rights to offset dilutions of holders 
or creditors, respectively, of conversion rights ( Wandlungsrechte ) or options ( Optionsrechte)  
regarding shares in the company or, as the case may be, conversion obligations 
(Wand lungspflichten ) from bonds issued or guaranteed by the company or its subsidiaries by 
granting them subscription rights in the amount they would be entitled to after exercising those 
conversion obligations. This is envisaged to afford adequate and customar y protection against 
dilution to the holders of such conversion rights or obligations. They are thus placed in the same 
position as if they were already shareholders. In order to be able to provide the bonds with such 
protection against dilution, the share holders' subscription rights to these shares must be excluded.  
In addition, the managing board of Siemens Energy AG is to be authorized, with the consent of the 
supervisory board, to exclude the subscription right pursuant to Section  186 (3) sentence  4 Akt G in 
the event of a capital increase against cash contributions, in which the issue price of the new shares 
is not significantly lower than the market price of the company's shares already listed (so -called 
simplified exclusion of subscription rights - erleichterter Bezugsrechtsausschluss ). With this 
authorization to exclude subscription rights in the case of capital increases in exchange for cash 
contributions, which is provided by statutory law, Siemens Energy AG will be enabled to quickly 
take advantage of favorable circumstances on the stock market and, thereby, to achieve an issue 
amount as high as possible as a result of the price determination close to the market – without a 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  192 discount for subscription rights – and thus to cover short -term capital requi rements. This 
authorization to exclude subscription rights is limited to an amount that on aggregate must not 
exceed 10  % of the company's capital stock. The relevant value is the capital stock at the time this 
authorization  takes effect or - if this value  is lower - at the time this authorization  is exercised. Since 
the Authorized Capital will only become effective with the effectiveness of the Spin -Off Capital 
Increase, the basis for the 10  % limit is the capital stock of Siemens Energy AG as increased by  the 
Spin-Off Capital Increase in an amount of EUR  726,645,193, however limited, if this value should 
be lower, to 10  % of the capital stock existing at the time the authorization  is exercised.  Such shares 
are to be counted towards the 10  % limit which during the term of the authorized capital are 
otherwise issued or disposed of with an exclusion of subscription rights in application, directly or 
mutatis mutandis , of Section  186 (3) sentence  4 AktG. A corresponding crediting to the limit 
amount is conducted for shares which are or have to be issued or granted or for the fulfilment of 
convertible or warrant bonds which themselves were issued during the term of the authorized 
capital with an exclus ion of the subscription right in application, mutatis mutandis , of Section  186 
(3) sentence  4 AktG. Subscription rights may only be excluded if the issue price of the new shares 
is not significantly lower than the stock market price of the Siemens Energy S hares already listed. 
The managing board of Siemens Energy  AG will make an effort to determine a possible discount 
on the stock market price as small as possible in accordance with the prevailing market conditions 
at the point in time of the placement. By the limitation of the number of shares to be issued and the 
obligation to determine the issue price of the new shares close to the stock price, the shareholders 
are sufficiently protected against a dilution of the value of their shares. At the same time, i t is 
ensured that the cash flow to be received by the company is appropriate. Besides, shareholders 
wishing to maintain the proportion of their shareholding in the case of a capital increase with an 
exclusion of subscription rights generally have the oppor tunity to acquire the number of shares 
required therefor through the stock exchange.  
Finally  the managing board of Siemens Energy AG is to be authorized, with the consent of the 
supervisory board, to exclude the subscription right  in case of a so -called st ock dividend 
(Aktiendividende ), in case of which the shareholders will be tendered to, as an alternative to a cash 
dividend, contribute their dividend right (in part or whole) into the company by way of contribution 
in kind against issuance of new shares f rom the authorized capital. The exclusion of subscription 
rights enables the stock dividend to be implemented under optimal conditions without impairing 
the equal opportunity to participate in the stock dividend.  
The volume of shares that may be issued wit h the exclusion of subscription rights in accordance 
with all of the above circumstances is limited in such a way that the arithmetical portion of the 
capital stock attributable to such shares may not exceed a nominal amount of EUR  72,664,519. The 
capital stock attributable to such new shares, which are issued during the term of this authorization 
on the basis of another authorization or to be issued on the basis of conversion or option rights or 
conversion obligations from bonds, insofar as the Bonds have been issued during the term of this 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  193 authorization under exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights (for more information see 
Chapter  X.4.h)), shall be counted towards this capital limit.  
 Authorization Pursuant to Section  221 AktG and Conditional Capita l 
Siemens  AG has undertaken in §  13.3 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement to ensure that prior 
to the Spin -off taking effect the shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG will authorize the 
managing board of Siemens Energy AG to issue convertible or wa rrant bonds pursuant to 
Section  221 AktG ( Wandel - oder Optionsschuldverschreibungen – together " Bonds ").  
Accordingly, it is intended that the future articles of association of Siemens Energy  AG provide for 
a conditional capital (" Conditional Capital ” – Bedingtes Kapital ) of up to a total of 
EUR  72,664,519. The application for registration of the conditional capital at the register of 
companies shall only be made after the Spin -Off Capital Increase has become effective and shall 
be valid until the end of 31 July 2025 . 
The exact wording of the intended authorization is attached to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement  
as Annex  13.3, which in turn is attached to this Spin -off Report  as Annex. The respective provisions 
can be summarized as follows:  
Under the in tended authorization the managing board of Siemens Energy AG may issue Bonds in 
the total value of up to EUR  4 billion  and, in connection therewith, grant or impose, respectively, 
conversion or option rights and conversion obligations regarding registered no-par value shares in 
Siemens Energy AG with a pro rata amount of  up to EUR  72,664,519 ("Maximum Amount of 
Capital Stock "). 
Alternatively, t he Bonds may also be issued by a group company of Siemens Energy AG. In this 
case, the managing board of Siemens En ergy AG may assume guarantees for bonds issued by group 
companies of Siemens Energy AG and grant or impose conversion or option rights and conversion 
obligations for Siemens Energy Shares on the holders or creditors of these bonds up to the 
Maximum Amount of Capital Stock. Additionally, the authorization provides for the possibility to, 
once or several times, issue subordinated or ordinary Bonds also simultaneously in different 
tranches.  
Bonds may be issued for financing purposes (raise of debt or equity ca pital), but also for any other 
purpose, e.g., to optimize the capital structure of the company. They may be issued in return for 
cash and  / or contributions in kind. In the case of warrant bonds, they can be issued against 
contributions in kind, provided t he terms and conditions of the warrants provide for the option price 
per Siemens Energy share to be paid in full in cash when the warrants are exercised.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  194 The holders or creditors, respectively, of convertible bonds shall, subject to the terms and 
condition s of the respective bond, have the right or obligation, respectively, to exchange their 
convertible bonds for shares in Siemens Energy AG. In case of warrant bonds, option rights are 
attached to each individual bond ( Anleihestück ), in particular in the for m of one or several warrants 
(Optionsscheine ) which entitle the holder or creditor, respectively, to receive Siemens Energy 
Shares, subject to the terms and conditions of the respective warrant bond. In each case, the 
conversion, exchange or allocation rat io, respectively, is calculated by dividing the nominal value, 
or, as the case may be, an issue price below the nominal value, of a warrant bond or, in case of the 
exercise of an warrant, of the payment owed under its respective terms, by the defined conve rsion 
or option price ( Wandlungs - oder Optionspreis ) for one Siemens Energy Share. The pro rata  
amount of the capital stock represented by the shares to be subscribed for each convertible bond or, 
in the event of a trade -in for a warrant bond, may not exceed the nominal value or, as the case may 
be, an issue price below the nominal value, of the Bon ds. 
The conversion/option price per share must not fall below 80  % of the price of a Siemens Energy 
Share in Xetra trading (or a comparable successor system), except in case of a conversion 
obligation. In the case of bonds with a conversion obligation, the  conversion price can be at least 
either the aforementioned minimum price or the average volume -weighted price of the Siemens 
Energy Share on at least three stock exchange trading days in Xetra trading (or in a comparable 
successor system) immediately prio r to the determination of the conversion price in accordance 
with the bond terms and conditions, even if this average price and the relevant conversion price 
derived from it is below the aforementioned minimum price (80  %). Section  9 (1)  AktG and 
Section  199 (2)  AktG remain unaffected.  
The authorization shall also provide for the possibility to grant protection against dilution or to 
make amendments, subject to the terms and conditions of the respective Bond.  
The conditions of issue and other terms and conditions of the bonds  shall be determined by the 
managing board of Siemens Energy AG or, if applicable, in agreement with the respective issuing 
group company.  
As a general rule, the shareholders of Siemens Energy  AG are entitled to the statutory subscri ption 
right for Bonds carrying warrant or conversion rights or conversion obligations (Section  221 (4) 
and Section  186 (1) AktG). In order to facilitate the technical processing of the issue, it is intended 
to make use of the possibility to issue the Bonds  to a financial institution or to institutions within 
the meaning of Section  53 (1) sentence  1 or Section  53b (1) sentence  1 or (7) Banking Act  
(Kreditwesengesetz) , subject to the obligation to offer the Bonds to the shareholders in accordance 
with their s ubscription right (indirect subscription right pursuant to Section  186 (5) AktG).  
The managing board of Siemens Energy  AG is authorized, with the approval of the supervisory 
board, to exclude the subscription right of the shareholders in its entirety, if t he Bonds are issued 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  195 against cash payment at an issue price which is not significantly lower than the market price of 
these Bonds as theoretically determined by generally accepted finance -mathematical methods. This 
awards Siemens Energy  AG the opportunity t o make use of favorable market opportunities at short 
notice and to obtain better conditions especially for the determination of the interest rate and the 
issue price of the Bonds by stipulating terms and conditions which are closer to the market 
environme nt. A stipulation of terms and conditions that are closely related to the market 
environment and a smooth placement would not be possible if the subscription right had to be 
observed. Section  186 (2) AktG allows for a publication of the issue price (and, t hus, the terms and 
conditions of these Bonds) until the third last day of the subscription period. However, given the 
volatility of the equity markets that is often observable, there still exists a market risk for several 
days, leading to safety discounts when determining the conditions of the Bonds and hence resulting 
in in terms that are not close to market conditions. Furthermore, if the subscription rights are 
granted, a successful placement with third parties is made more difficult or entails additiona l efforts, 
given the uncertainty regarding the exercise of the subscription right (subscription behavior). 
Finally, if subscription rights were granted, Siemens Energy  AG would be unable to react to 
favorable or unfavorable changes in market conditions on short notice because of the duration of 
the subscription period, but would be exposed to declining stock prices during the subscription 
period which may lead to Siemens Energy  AG procuring capital on unfavorable terms.  
Pursuant to Section  221 (4) sentence  2 AktG, the provision in Section  186 (3) sentence  4 AktG 
applies mutatis mutandis to this case of an exclusion of the subscription right in its entirety. 
According to the content of the resolution, the limit stipulated in this provision for the exclusion o f 
the subscription right of up to 10  % of the capital stock has to be complied with. It is ensured by 
means of a respective stipulation in the authorization resolution that the limit of 10  % is neither 
exceeded in the case of a capital reduction, since it is expressly prohibited for the authorization to 
exclude the subscription right to exceed an amount of 10  % of the capital stock, both at the time of 
the becoming effective and – in the event that this value is lower – at the time of the utilization of 
the authorization. By means of the stipulation in the authorization resolution that the authorization 
is limited to 10  % of the capital stock at the time of the utilization of the authorization, it is ensured 
that the limit of 10  % is not exceeded in the case  of a subsequent capital reduction, either. Such 
shares are to be counted towards the aforementioned 10  % limit which during the term of the 
authorization are issued or disposed of with an exclusion of subscription rights in application, 
directly or mutati s mutandis , of Section  186 (3) sentence  4 AktG. Also to be counted towards the 
aforementioned 10%  limit are shares which have been or will be issued or granted, respectively, 
under a convertible or warrant bond which is issued during the term of this autho rization and of 
which the terms and condition exclude the subscription right in mutatis mutandis application of 
Section  186 (3) sentence  4 AktG.  
The other proposed cases in which the managing board may exclude the subscription right with the 
consent of the  supervisory board serve only to simplify the issuing of Bonds.  The exclusion of 
fractional amounts is reasonable and in line with market conditions in order to be able to establish 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  196 a practical subscription ratio. In addition, the potential dilution effect  is generally very low due to 
the limitation to fractional amounts. The customary exclusion of the subscription right in favor of 
the holders or creditors of already issued bonds can be advantageous if the conversion or option 
price for the bonds already i ssued and regularly equipped with an anti -dilution mechanism does not 
need to be reduced.  
In all the above -mentioned cases in which the issue of Bonds with an exclusion of subscription 
rights is permissible, there applies a uniform maximum volume based on the arithmetical proportion 
of the capital stock of the shares which are to be issued or granted on the basis of the Bonds issued 
with an exclusion of subscription rights.  The calculated proportion of the capital stock of these 
shares may not exceed a nomi nal amount of EUR  72,664,519 . The capital stock attributable to those 
new shares which are issued during the term of this authorization on the basis of other 
authorizations (such as the Authorized Capital described above under Chapter  X.4.g)) with the 
exclusion of subscription rights or which are to be issued on the basis of conversion or option rights 
or conversion obligations from Bonds, shall be counted towards the aforementioned capital limit, 
provided that the Bonds were issued during the term of this authorization with the exclusion of 
shareholders' subscription rights.  
 Authorization to Acquire and Use Treasury Shares  
In § 13.2 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement, Siemens  AG undertook to ensure that, prior to 
the Spin -off taking effect, the shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG authorizes the 
managing board of Siemens Energy  AG pursuant to Section  71 (1) no.  8 AktG to, until the end of 
31 July 2025, acquire treasury shares up to the amount equivalent to the lower of 10  % of the 
company's capital stock at the time of the authorization or at the time the authorization is utilized. 
The resolution of the shareholder' s meeting of Siemens Energy AG is not to take effect until the 
implementation of the Spin -off Capital Increase takes effect, so that the aforementioned 10  % limit 
at the time the authorization takes effect must already be based on the increased capital sto ck of 
Siemens Energy AG.  
As part of the corporate  law bundling of the Siemens Energy Business under Siemens Energy KG, 
Siemens AG has provided Siemens Energy KG with liquid funds, which included an amount of 
EUR  393 million intended for the implementation of a share buyback program of Siemens Energy 
AG shortly (a period of presumably six months is envisaged)  after the shares of Siemens Energy 
AG have been admitted to the stock exchange. The shares thus acquired shall  be used for the 
implementation of stock -based payment programs of the Future Siemens Energy Group (for this 
see below; see Chapter  V.1.d) ) for details of the bundling of the Siemens Energy Business under 
Siemens Energy KG).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  197 The exact wording of the envisaged authorization is attached as Annex  13.2 to the Spin -off and 
Transfer Agreement, which in turn is attached to this Spin -off Report as Annex. The provisions can 
be summarized as follows:  
The sum of the treasury shares acquired under the authorization and any other treasury shares 
possibly acqui red for any other reason which are held by, or which pursuant to Sections  71d and 
71e AktG  are to be attributed to, Siemens Energy AG shall together never exceed the equivalent of 
10 % of the capital stock of Siemens Energy AG.  
To ensure sufficient flexibi lity for Siemens Energy AG, the authorization shall provide for an 
acquisition via a stock exchange, by public purchase offering ( öffentliches Kaufangebot ) as well as 
by public exchange offering ( öffentliches Tauschangebot ). The managing board shall be abl e to 
determine the details of the respective acquisition rights or of potential tender rights 
(Andienungsrechte ). In the event the number of Siemens Energy Shares offered for sale or exchange 
exceeds the intended acquisition volume, the tender right of the  shareholders may be excluded in 
the manner that the company only acquires a portion of the shares offered or tendered, respectively, 
by a shareholder. Such portion shall be equivalent to the ratio of the shares offered or tendered, 
respectively, by all sh areholders to the initially intended acquisition volume. In addition, provisions 
for a preferred consideration of low quantities up to 150 Siemens Energy Shares offered or 
tendered, respectively, per shareholder as well as rounding in accordance with stand ard commercial 
practice may be made.  
The authorization shall provide for the use for any permissible purpose. This includes, inter alia , 
the disposal via stock exchanges or by public offering to all shareholders and the cancellation 
(Einziehung ) of the sh ares – with our without reduction of capital.  
In addition, the authorization provides for special uses in which the shareholders' subscription rights 
to acquired treasury shares are excluded:  
The treasury shares acquired shall be usable under exclusion of subscription rights in connection 
with stock -based compensation programs or employee share programs of Siemens Energy AG or 
its affiliates and issued to persons who have or had an employment relationship with the company 
or an affiliate of the company as w ell as to members of executive bodies ( Organmitglieder ) thereof. 
In particular, they may be offered, pledged and transferred to such persons either against cash or 
for free, subject to the employment relationship or membership in the executive body, respec tively, 
is still existing at the time of the offering, pledge or transfer.  
The issue of shares to employees of Siemens Energy AG or its affiliated companies and to members 
of the executive bodies of companies affiliated with Siemens Energy AG is intended to strengthen 
the identification of the aforementioned persons with Siemens Energy. They should be bound to 
the company and participate as shareholders in its long -term development. In the interests of the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  198 company and its shareholders, this is intended to strengthen understanding and the willingness to 
assume greater, above all ec onomic, joint responsibility. The issue of shares also makes it possible 
to create structures with a long -term incentive effect, in which not only positive but also negative 
developments can be taken into account. For example, the granting of shares with a  lock-up or 
blocking period or with holding incentives allows a malus  effect in the event of negative 
developments in addition to the bonus. It is thus intended to provide an incentive to ensure a 
sustained increase in value for the company. For stock -based payment programs planned in the 
Future Siemens Energy Group, see Chapter  X.4.j).  
In addition, the resolution provides for an authorization of the supervisory board to use treasury 
shares under exclusion of the subscription right to service or to secure a cquisition obligations or 
rights of members of the managing board that were agreed with them in the context of their 
remuneration arrangements and to offer, promise and transfer the shares to members of the 
managing board of Siemens Energy AG. This enables  the implementation of stock -based 
remuneration components for members of the managing board. Stock -based remuneration 
components for members of the managing board are intended to link the amount of their 
remuneration to the success that shareholders of Si emens Energy AG achieve with their investment 
in the company. They are recommended by the DCGK. See the explanation in Chapter  X.4.d) for 
the remuneration system envisaged for members of the managing of Siemens Energy AG.  
Additionally, with the approval of  the supervisory board, it is to be possible to sell acquired treasury 
shares against cash payment excluding subscription rights. The prerequisite for such a sale is that 
the selling price is not significantly lower than the stock market price of a Siemens  Energy Share. 
The possibility of selling acquired treasury shares for cash, excluding shareholders' subscription 
rights, serves the company's interest in achieving the best possible price when selling treasury 
shares. The exclusion of subscription rights enables a placement close to the stock market price, so 
that the discount typical in subscription right issues is not applicable. Compared with a sale of the 
shares over a longer period of time on the stock exchange, this procedure leads to an immediate 
inflow of funds and avoids the uncertainties of future stock market developments for the total 
purchase price received. The company is put in a position to quickly, flexibly and cost -effectively 
take advantage of opportunities that arise within the circumsta nces of the respective stock market 
conditions. The arithmetical proportion of the capital stock attributable to the shares sold under 
such a simplified exclusion of subscription rights may not exceed a total of 10  % of the capital 
stock at the time of the  authorization  becoming effective (in the present case, this will be after the 
Spin-off Capital Increase becomes effective, so that the correspondingly increased capital stock 
must be taken as a basis) or - if this value is lower - at the time the authoriz ation  is exercised. Shares 
are counted towards the aforementioned 10  % limit, which are otherwise under the exclusion of 
subscription rights being issued during the term of the authorization in direct or analogous 
application of Section  186 (3) sentence  4 AktG. Additionally, shares have to be counted towards, 
which have been issued or granted or will be issued or granted because of a convertible bond or an 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  199 option bond which was issued during the term of this authorization under the exclusion of 
subscription  rights in analogous application of Section  186 (3) sentence  4 AktG. By basing the 
selling price on the stock exchange price, the idea of protection against dilution is taken into account 
and the shareholders' interests in assets and voting rights are adeq uately safeguarded. When 
determining the final selling price, the management will endeavor  to keep any discount on the stock 
exchange price as low as possible - taking into account current market conditions. In principle, the 
shareholders have the opportun ity to maintain their shareholding quota by purchasing Siemens 
Energy Shares on the stock exchange at comparable conditions, while the company is given further 
scope for action in the interests of the shareholders.  
Also, under exclusion of subscription rig hts, the use of treasury shares to service or to secure 
acquisition obligations or acquisition rights with respect to Siemens Energy Shares, in particular 
out of and in connection with, convertible  / warrant bonds 
(Wandel - / Optionsschuldverschreibungen ) issued by the company or its affiliates shall be 
permitted. This is required to be able to use treasury shares also to comply with acquisition 
obligations or rights in connection with convertible  / warrant bonds issued by the company or its 
affiliates. Furt hermore, it should be possible to exclude the subscription right in order to grant 
subscription rights to the holders or, as the case may be, creditors of conversion or option rights for 
shares in the company or corresponding conversion obligations to comp ensate for dilution to the 
extent to which they would be entitled after already having exercised these rights or fulfilled these 
obligations, and to use treasury shares to cover such subscription rights. In this way, the holders or 
obligors of such option or conversion rights or conversion obligations are to be granted appropriate 
and customary protection against dilution. They are thus put in the same position as if they were 
already shareholders. In order to be able to provide the bonds with such dilution  protection, the 
shareholders' subscription rights to these shares must be excluded.  
The authorization is also intended to enable the managing board to use treasury shares for listing 
on foreign stock exchanges where the company's shares are not yet listed . The company faces 
intense competition on the international capital markets. The ability to raise equity capital on these 
markets at reasonable conditions at any time is of great importance for future business development. 
The possible introduction of the  share on foreign stock exchanges serves this purpose, as it broadens 
the shareholder base abroad and increases the attractiveness of the share as an investment object. 
The proposed exclusion of subscription rights creates the possibility of such a listing  on foreign 
stock exchanges. In order to protect the interests of the shareholders, the price at which these shares 
are introduced on foreign stock exchanges may not be more than 5  % below the arithmetic mean 
of the prices of the company's no -par-value sha res in the closing auction in Xetra trading (or a 
corresponding successor system) on the Frankfurt stock exchange during the last three trading days 
prior to the date of introduction on the foreign stock exchange, not including incidental acquisition 
costs . 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  200 Finally, in the case of an offer to acquire treasury shares to all shareholders, the subscription right 
for fractional amounts can be excluded. This enables the use of the authorization with round 
amounts and facilitates the handling of the shareholders'  subscription right.  
 Stock -Based Compensation Programs and Employee Participation Programs  
To have the members of the managing board and other executives and employees of the Future 
Siemens Energy Group participate in the long -term and sustainable success of the business, and to 
carry on the ownership culture as lived at Siemens Group, stock -based compensation programs and 
employee participation programs shall be implemented in the Future Siemens Energy Group. In 
doing so, the Future Siemens Energy Group is  continuing the long tradition of stock -based 
compensation  programs and employee participation programs in the Siemens Group.  
In particular, the introduction of a share  matching  program, the granting of stock awards and 
commitments to grant jubilee shares (Jubiläumsaktien ) are planned and commitments to a one -time 
spin-off incentive have been granted or are planned.  
Under the share -matching program, members of executives bodies ( Organmitglieder ) and 
employees of the Future Siemens Energy Group , with the exc eption of the managing board of 
Siemens Energy AG,  may invest  part of their income  in Siemens Energy Shares, whereby they will 
receive – to the extend that  they are employed as of certain predetermined effective dates by 
Siemens Energy AG or any other  Future Siemens Energy Group company with registered office  in 
Germany participat ing in the programs  – in respect of an investment of EUR  100 for every acquired 
Siemens Energy Share, additionally two further shares (matching shares) and , in the case of  a 
further investment of EUR 160  for every acquired Siemens Energy Share, additionally one further 
matching share; the acquired and the additional matching shares are not subject to any holding or 
vesting period . By this arrangement , an application of Section  3 no. 39 EStG regarding the tax 
exemption of benefits of employees within the scope of a current employment relationship from 
the gratuitous transfer of asset shares in the employer's company, provided that the total benefit 
does not exceed EUR  360 per cale ndar year shall be enabled. In respect of any investment beyond 
that and in respect of members of corporate bodies and employees who are employed on the 
relevant effective dates by any group company with registered office abroad participating in the 
progra ms, they will receive additionally one further matching share for every three Siemens Energy 
shares acquired; in this regard, both the acquired and the additional matching shares are subject to 
a vesting period of one year. The share -matching program is in tended to strengthen the 
identification of  the employees of the Future Siemens Energy Group with the interests of the Future 
Siemens Energy Group.  
In addition to the share -matching program, in which the managing board of Siemens Energy AG 
does not participate, certain senior  executives – like the managing board of Siemens Energy AG as 
well (regarding the remuneration program of the members of the man aging board in the form of 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  201 stock awards refer to Chapter  X.4.d) – are to  receive a part of their remuneration as long-term stock -
based compensation (stock awards), which will be  subject to a four -year vesting  period. The 
granting of stock awards strengthen s the interest of the members of the managing board of Siemens 
Energy AG and other executives in a long -term increase in the value of the company. Furthermore, 
the identification of the beneficiaries with the interests of the capital owners and the ownersh ip 
culture will be strengthened. When the stock awards are fulfilled, the company's development on 
the capital market in relation to its competitors, the financial development of Siemens Energy AG 
as well as the performance of the Siemens Energy AG regardi ng environmental, social and 
governance criteria shall be taken into account.  
Also envisaged are the assignment of stock awards, whose fulfillment does not depend on the 
achievement of defined goals, as compensation component for the rest of the senior management 
and other selected members of executives bodies and employees as well as exceptional assignments 
for special achievements or projects, the latter of which may be assigned to any member of 
executives bodies and employee also more than once per fiscal year, except for the members of the 
managing board of Siemens Energy AG. Such stock awards are to be fulfilled one quarter each 
after the first year, the second year, the third year and the fourth year, respectively; one Siemens 
Energy Share per stock award is to be delivered (or, at the company's discretion, the corresponding 
amount is to be paid in cash instead).  
For members of executive bodies and employees, who will be employed in a Siemens Energy 
Group Company with its registered office  in Germany, a  jubilee  share program shall be launched 
under  entitled employees shall receiv e jubilee  shares at certain service anniversaries . The time of 
service in the Siemens Group is taken into account for such service anniversaries . 
Subject to the condition of the successful, timely Spin -off and the IPO certain members of executive 
bodies an d employees of the Future Siemens Energy Group, who have contributed significantly to 
the successful Spin -off, received  a one -time spin -off incentive , which – unlike the spin -off 
incentive for the managing board of Siemens Energy AG – is structured as follows . The spin -off 
incentive consists of two elements: a short -term cash component (bonus), which will be paid after 
effectiveness of the Spin -off and which is equal to 25  % of the target amount and a long-term stock 
based component which is equal to 75  % of the target amount and due after a three -year vesting 
period after effectiveness of the Spin -off. The target amount equals a certain percentage of the 
beneficiary's basic remuneration. The long-term stock based component depends positively and 
negativ ely on the development of the share price of the Siemens Energy share in the three years 
following the IPO and is generally fulfilled in the form of Siemens Energy Shares. In case the share 
price doubles during this period, it can amount to a maximum total  inflow from the spin -off 
incentive of 4.75 times the target amount. In general, the prerequisite is that the respective 
Beneficiary is employed by the Future Siemens Energy Group at the time of performance. In 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  202 relation to all Beneficiaries, this can presu mably lead to a total inflow of  a maximum of 
approximately EUR  100 million . 
In addition, the Future Siemens Energy Group plans to grant commitments to other members of 
executive bodies and employees of the Future Siemens Energy Group to receive shares as p art of a 
one-time spin -off incentive on the occasion of the initial listing. The target amount for t his spin -off 
incentive equals 3  % of the gross annual income of the respective Beneficiary with 100  % target 
achievement. The number of shares to be granted  is dependent on the development of the share 
price of the Siemens Energy share in the three years following the IPO. The maximum value of 
Siemens Energy shares granted is six times the target amount if the share price doubles. In general, 
the prerequisite  for the granting of stocks  is that the respective Beneficiary is employed by the 
Future Siemens Energy Group at the time of performance. In relation to all Beneficiaries, this can 
presumably lead to a total inflow of a maximum of approximately EUR  680 million. 
In order to procure the shares required to service the stock -based payment programs and employee 
participation programs, the authorization to acquire and use treasury shares described in 
Chapter  X.4.i) shall be exercised.  
  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  203 XI. Relationships between the Future Siemens -Group and the Future Siemens Energy -Group 
after the Spin -off 
Certain legal and commercial relationships will exist between the Future Siemens -Group and the 
Future Siemens Energy -Group after the Spin -off takes effect . These relationships will be described 
in the following:  
1. Relationships under Corporate Law and Deconsolidation  Agreement  
After the Spin -off taking effect Siemens  AG will initially remain a non -controlling anchor 
shareholder in Siemens Energy  AG with a 35. 1 % shareholding directly and indirectly via 
SBI GmbH. Additionally, SPT e.V. will hold a 9.9  % stake in Siemens Energy  AG. With the 
strategic and operational development of Siemens Energy  AG and Siemens  AG, Siemens  AG 
intends to reduce its stake in Siemen s Energy AG significantly in a timeframe of twelve to 18 
months after the Spin -off taking effect.  The Future Siemens -Group will thus in total be the largest 
individual shareholder of Siemens Energy AG. In the Deconsolidation  Agreement entered into 
between Siemens AG, SBI GmbH and Siemens Energy AG, Siemens  AG and SBI  GmbH have 
undertaken not to exercise some of their voting rights arising from their participation in Siemens 
Energy AG (see Chapter  XIII.3.).  
Furthermore, there will be, at least temporarily, t he following corporate interrelationships between 
the Future Siemens Energy  Group and the Future Siemens  Group:  
 The Future Siemens Energy -Group will have a participation of 24  % in Siemens Ltd., India , 
and the Future Siemens  Group  of approximately 51  % (fo r further details see 
Chapter  III.2.c)).  
 In Siemens Gas and Power Holding B.V., in which the respective Local Siemens Energy 
Business  of a large number of countries has been bundled, the Future Siemens  Group  will 
initially hold a minority participation of up to 1.7  % (for further details see Chapter  V.1.c)).  
 After the Spin -off takes effect, Siemens AG will still hold an interest in the amount of 11  % 
of the fixed capital of Siemens Gas and Power Real Estate GmbH  & Co. KG, while the 
remaining majority intere st in Siemens Gas and Power Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG will 
be held by the Future Siemens Energy  Group (for further details see  Chapter  V.1.b)).  
For those countries in which the Local Siemens Energy Business has not been legally separated 
from the other loc al business activities of the Siemens Group, agency agreements or comparable 
agreements will be concluded, which will continue to exist after the Spin -off takes effect (for further 
details Chapter  III.2.c)).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  204 2. Master Separation Agreement and Group Separation  Agreement  
On 31  March  2020, Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  KG concluded a framework agreement (a 
so-called " Master Separation Agreement ") to address certain consequences arising from the 
Carve -out of the Siemens Energy Business. Pursuant to the Master Separation Agreement, 
Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  KG ensure the fulfillment of the obligations of their respective 
subsidiaries under the Carve -out related agreements and are each jointly and severally liable with 
their respective obligated subsidiaries.  The framework agreement also contains indemnification 
commitments of Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  KG with regard to the separation of the Siemens 
Energy Business from the other Siemens businesses. For the assertion of indemnification claims, a 
mechanism for pooling of claims was established at the level of the parties to the Master Separation 
Agreement.  
The Master Separation Agreement also sets out the framework for the separation of the financing 
of the Future Siemens Energy Group from the Future Siemens  Group and the handling of securities 
for the Siemens Energy Business (for further details see Chapters  V.3. and XI.6.).  
Furthermore, the Master Separation Agreement contains provisions regarding service agreements 
for a transitional period of generally tw elve months following the Loss of Control, data separation 
and migration, real estate and rental agreements, stock -based participation programs, taxes, 
insurance, certain separation costs and future cooperation.  
Moreover, at the same time as the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement is concluded, Siemens  AG and 
Siemens Energy  AG have entered into a certain Group Separation Agreement which governs the 
legal relations between Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG for the period from the closing of the 
Spin-off and the r esulting division of the Siemens Energy Business, including Siemens Energy  AG, 
from the Siemens Group (for further details see Chapter  XIII.4.).  
3. Trademark License Agreements  
 Trademark License Agreement with Siemens Energy  KG 
A new trademark license agreeme nt between Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  KG will enter into 
force upon the Loss of Control (" Trademark License Agreement "). After the Spin -off has taken 
effect, the agreement may be transferred to Siemens Energy  AG with the approval of Siemens  AG, 
whereby Siemens  AG may not withhold its approval without reasonable cause.  
Under this Trademark License Agreement, Siemens  AG grants Siemens Energy  KG the exclusive 
right to use the combination "Siemens Energy" in the company name and as a company and product 
trademark for activities within the current Siemens Energy Business area as it was operated  / fixed 
as of 1  October  2019 (including certain products and services that are the subject of research and 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  205 development activities ongoing at that time) and defined in t he contribution agreement for the 
German Siemens Energy Business Operations (with the exception of the business area of SGRE) 
("Licensed Siemens Energy Business Area "). 
Also outside of the Licensed Siemens Energy Business Area, Siemens  AG will neither use nor 
otherwise license the "Siemens Energy" trademark. Subject to differing arrangements with third 
parties, the Trademark License Agreement does not, however, prevent Siemens  AG from operating 
in the future under the trademark "Siemens" with or without fur ther additions (with the exception 
of the addition "Energy") in the Licensed Siemens Energy Business Area or future business areas 
of Siemens Energy  KG. 
For the duration of the Trademark License Agreement, Siemens Energy  KG is obliged to use the 
designatio n "Siemens Energy" as the company name and the trademark "Siemens Energy" in the 
Licensed Siemens Energy Business Area at all application levels (company and product trademark). 
Business conducted under third -party trademarks (e.g. "Guascor" or "Trench") a t the time of the 
signing of the Trademark License Agreement shall continue to be managed separately. With respect 
to the business managed under "Dresser -Rand", Siemens Energy  KG is free to either continue to 
manage this business separately or to convert i t to "Siemens Energy". In the event that Siemens 
Energy KG, within the Licensed Siemens Energy Business Area, acquires a business from a third 
party or forms a joint venture over which it has control, then Siemens Energy KG may decide, at 
its own discretio n, whether the newly acquired business shall use the "Siemens Energy" trademark 
under the conditions set forth above or whether the business shall be conducted within a separate 
company without the use of the designation "Siemens Energy". To the extent tha t Siemens Energy 
KG opens new business areas outside of the Licensed Siemens Energy Business Area, either 
through organic growth or acquisitions, the parties, upon the request of Siemens Energy KG, shall 
discuss an expansion in good faith. Siemens AG may n ot unreasonably withhold its consent, 
provided, however, that the Trademark License Agreement contains detailed provisions which set 
forth the conditions under which Siemens AG may provide its consent for the expansion of the 
business area. If Siemens  AG d oes not approve the use of the trademark, Siemens Energy  KG may 
only operate in the new business area through a separate company , which is not entitled to use the 
name and trademark "Siemens Energy".  
Siemens Energy  KG is entitled and – with the exception o f the above -mentioned business 
conducted under third -party trademarks – obligated to grant a sublicense to affiliated companies, 
including Siemens Energy  AG, for the use of the "Siemens Energy" trademark in accordance with 
the provisions of the Trademark L icense Agreement and to ensure that they are obligated to use the 
designation "Siemens Energy" in the Licensed Siemens Energy Business Area.  
Siemens Energy  KG pays margin -based royalties  for the use of the "Siemens Energy" trademark. 
These royalties  depen d on the EBITA margin of the Future Siemens Energy Group (excluding 
SGRE), as adjusted for certain special items as set forth in the Trademark License Agreement, and 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  206 ranges between 0.3  % (if the adjusted EBITA margin is less than or equal to 6.5  %) and 1.2  % (if 
the adjusted EBITA margin is equal to or greater than 9  %) of sales revenues (excluding value 
added  tax) generated with products and services under the "Siemens Energy" trademark or, until 
the transition to the "Siemens Energy" trademark, under the "Siemens" trademark. Based on a linear 
projection for the entire fiscal year 2020 of the semi -annual figures of the combined financial 
statements for the first half -year (ending on 31  March 2020), the license fee to be paid by Siemens 
Energy KG for fiscal year 2020 would be in the  mid-double -digit million Euro range. The adequacy 
of the license fee shall be reviewed at regular intervals.  
The Trademark License Agreement has a fixed initial term of ten years. If the Trademark License 
Agreement is not terminat ed in due time with a three -year notice period, the term is automatically 
extended by a further three years in each case.  
Siemens  AG may terminate the Trademark License Agreement with immediate effect, subject to a 
notice period of three months following t he occurrence of a terminating event as set forth below. 
Thereafter, a three -year (or in the case of a termination under (ii) below, a two -year) transition 
period for the use of the trademark and name “Siemens Energy” shall commence. Such an 
extraordinary right of termination exists in particular, if:  
 (i) Siemens  AG (directly or indirectly) holds less than 25  % of the shares in Siemens 
Energy  AG after the expiration of three years after the Trademark License Agreement has 
taken effect (whereby shares transf erred to a trustee, e.g. in the case of the SPT  e.V. for the 
coverage of pension obligations, shall not be taken into account);  
 (ii) another shareholder who is in substantial competition with a business of the Future 
Siemens Group holds more than 15  % of t he shares in Siemens Energy  AG; 
 (iii) a Sovereign Wealth Fund or a financial investor holds (directly or indirectly) more 
than 25  % of the shares in Siemens Energy  AG; 
 (iv) another shareholder holds (directly or indirectly) more than 25  % of the shares in 
Siemens Energy  AG or has control over Siemens Energy  AG; or  
 (v) Siemens Energy  KG is no longer an affiliated company of Siemens Energy  AG or 
Siemens Energy  AG no longer uses the designation "Siemens" in its company name.  
In addition, Siemens  AG may terminate the Trademark License Agreement with immediate effect 
for a material reason under application of contractually determined transition periods in the case of 
an objective unreasonableness of continuing the contract, if t he Future Siemens Energy Group 
commits a material contractual breach by not complying with certain best industry practices as set 
forth in the Trademark License Agreement (such as the obligation to establish and maintain a 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  207 compliance system in line with in dustry standards) and such breach cannot be remedied as provided 
for in the Trademark License Agreement's escalation mechanism.  
Moreover, either party may terminate the Trademark License Agreement  with immediate effect 
and a contractually defined transitio n period based on the reason for termination in the case of an 
objective unreasonableness of continuing the contract, if the other party has committed a material 
breach, which upon the completion of the escalation process defined in the Trademark License 
Agreement could not be remedied. Furthermore, either party may terminate the Trademark License 
Agreement with immediate effect and a contractually defined transition period in the case of an 
objective unreasonableness of continuing the contract, if, in the view of the party, the reputation of 
the "Siemens" trademark is being materially harmed by the actions of the other party or a third 
party and the required crisis communication and escalation mechanism could not be successfully 
completed or the reputationa l risk could not be resolved. The contract also contains other industry 
standard termination rights, for example in the case of insolvency. The Trademark License 
Agreement between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG does not specify a termination right for 
the case that the Trademark License Agreement between Siemens AG and SGRE S.A. is 
terminated.  
 Trademark License Agreement with SGRE  S.A. 
Siemens AG and SGRE S.A. have entered into a separate trademark license agreement regarding 
the use of the trademark "Sie mens Gamesa", which will replace the currently existing Trademark 
License Agreement upon the Loss of Control of Siemens AG over SGRE S.A. The new trademark 
license agreement contains largely similar conditions to those contained in the Siemens Energy 
trade mark license agreement. As with the previously existing arrangement, SGRE S.A. is not 
obligated to pay a license fee.  
Siemens AG grants SGRE S.A. further the exclusive right to use "Siemens Gamesa" in both 
company names and as company and product trademark  and "SGRE" as the abbreviation of the 
company name. The scope of the trademark license partially extends beyond the existing trademark 
license agreement. SGRE S.A. is obligated to the same extent to use the designation "Siemens 
Gamesa" as company name and  the trademark "Siemens Gamesa" at all levels of application 
(company brand and product trademark). The products and services of Gamesa Electric and 
Gamesa Gearbox continue to be excluded. Should SGRE S.A. open new business areas outside of 
the defined sco pe, Siemens AG, upon the request of SGRE S.A., shall decide in good faith whether 
to consent to a potential extension of the right to use to such business areas. To the extent that 
Siemens AG does not consent to trademark use for the new business areas, SG RE S.A. may only 
engage in the new business areas through separate companies, which do not use the name or 
trademark "Siemens Gamesa".  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  208 The trademark license agreement has a fixed initial term of ten years and is extended automatically 
by a further three y ears in each case unless terminated in due time with three years' notice. 
Siemens  AG may terminate the trademark license agreement for the use of the name and trademark 
"Siemens Gamesa" with immediate effect, subject to a transition period of three years, within three 
months of the occurrence of the following reasons for termination:  
 (i) the trademark license agreement between Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  KG is 
terminated;  
 (ii) SGRE S.A. is no longer directly or indirectly controlled by Siemens Energy  AG; or 
 (iii) SGRE S.A. no longer uses the designation "Siemens" in its company name.  
In addition, as with the trademark license agreement with Siemens Energy KG, there are 
extraordinary termination rights for Siemens AG if certain best industry practices are n ot complied 
with, and for both parties in the case of reputational risks, whereby an effective termination always 
presumes that despite the execution of the escalation mechanism the respective breach could not be 
remedied and a continuation of the contract  would be objectively unreasonable for the terminating 
party. In addition, SGRE S.A. can terminate the trademark license agreement with immediate effect 
and a transition period of three years if Siemens AG offers certain products or services under the 
trademark of "Siemens", which affect the defined core business area of SGRE S.A.  
4. Service Agreements  
After the Carve -out of the Siemens Energy Business and the Spin -off have taken effect, Siemens 
Energy  KG and other companies of the Future Siemens Energy  Group  will continue to receive 
services from the Future Siemens  Group for a transitional period until the Future Siemens 
Energy  Group has successfully established its own departments and functions; certain services will 
probably be provided on a long -term basis  to the Future Siemens Energy  Group by means of 
outsourcing arrangements. In this regard, Siemens  AG and various Future Siemens Group 
Companies have entered into service agreements with Future Siemens Energy Group Companies 
effective as of the Loss of Cont rol. With some exceptions, these service agreements generally have 
terms of between twelve and 36 months. The respective Future Siemens Energy Group Companies 
have requested the conclusion of corresponding contracts depending on their needs. All contracts 
were concluded under standard market conditions . 
In particular the following contracts were concluded before 31  March  2020.  
 Transitional Services Agreements ( Übergangsdienstleistungsverträge ) essentially refer to 
services provided by the Siemens informatio n technology departments. The terms are up 
to 36 months.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  209  Furthermore, there are long -term service agreements for various topics. These include inter 
alia: 
o A framework agreement with the Siemens "Global Business Services" unit for the 
provision of services in the areas of human resources and accounting, purchasing, sales 
& marketing support as well as project & transformation management. The framework 
agreement and the local adoption agreements ( lokale Ausführungsverträge ) concluded 
under it are designed for  a term of at least 36 months following Loss of Control.  
o Human resources agreements focusing on human resources IT processes, health 
management and safety, as well as training over a period of  up to  36 months.  
o Agreements with the Siemens "Communications" unit and agreements with the 
"Strategy, Transformation and Organization" unit over a period of 24 to 36 months.  
o Agreements with the Siemens "Security" unit over a period of 36 months  
o Agreements with the Siemens "Corporate Technology, CT" unit of Siemens  AG 
concerning services in the area of research and development, cybersecurity and patent 
management with an expected term of 24 to 36 months.  
o Agreements on procurement  pooling and procurement  services over a term of 36 
months.  
o A framework agreement with the Siemens " Siemens Advanta " unit  in order to render 
services in the area of research, development and engineering. The framework 
agreement and the Local Adoption Agreements concluded thereunder are designed to 
run until at least 31  March 2024.  
The total volu me of Transitional Services Agreements and long -term service agreements over the 
entire term of the contracts amounts to a cumulative amount of approximately EUR  1 billion . 
In some cases, it was agreed that the respective Future Siemens Energy Group Compan ies will have 
to assume employees of the service provider concerned when the respective service agreements 
expire (for information on the transfer of employees, see Chapter  V.4.).  
In addition, certain already existing service agreements between SGRE and th e Future Siemens 
Group Companies shall  continue to exist following the Spin -off taking effect. The service 
agreements were each entered into on standard market terms and conditions. This applies on the 
one hand to services during the transition period (tra nsitional service agreements), in particular in 
the area of IT and human resources and, on the other hand, additional service agreements, in 
particular in the area of procurement.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  210 5. Rental Agreements  
Rental agreements for production, manufacturing, storage, office and other commercial space have 
been concluded between Future Siemens Group Companies (as landlords) and Future Siemens 
Energy Group Companies (as tenants) under standard market conditions and will continue to exist 
after the Spin -off takes effect. This applies to a total area of approximately 450,000  square meters 
in approximately 250 properties worldwide. The total rental expenses of the Future Siemens 
Energy  Group including operating and ancillary costs as well as the related services in the fisca l 
year 2019 under rental agreements with Future Siemens Group Companies amounted to 
approximately EUR  90 million . It is expected that the figures for the fiscal year 2020 will be slightly 
higher due to additional space for transferred employees from centra l functions. The most important 
agreements relate to sites in Germany (in particular Berlin and Erlangen).  
Furthermore, lease -back agreements have been concluded between Future Siemens Group 
Companies (as tenants) and Future Siemens Energy Group Companies (as landlords) for parts of 
the commercial properties transferred to Future Siemens Energy Group Companies under standard 
market  conditions. These lease -back agreements will also remain in effect after the Spin -off 
becomes effective. This relates  to a total area of approximately 100,000  square meters worldwide. 
The total rental expenses of the Future Siemens  Group under these lease -back agreements amount 
to estimated EUR  20 million  in the fiscal year 2020.  
Moreover, there are some properties that are rented by Future Siemens Group Companies and sublet 
in whole or in part to Future Siemens Energy Group Companies. As long as a transfer of the main 
rental agreements to the respective Future Siemens Energy Group Company in the course of the 
Spin-off is  not possible due to a lack of consent of the landlords, these subleases will be continued 
to the extent contractually permissible.  
6. Financing  / Treasury  / Insurance  
In connection with the Spin -off taking effect, the Future Siemens Energy  Group will be sepa rated 
from the currently existing financing structures of the Siemens  Group (in this regard see 
Chapter  V.3.). However, certain arrangements in the areas of financing, treasury and insurance will 
continue to exist between the Future Siemens Group and the F uture Siemens Energy Group.  
 Financing  
In connection with the Spin -off taking effect, the Future Siemens Energy  Group will secure its 
financing independently. Existing financing by Siemens  AG and the Future Siemens  Group is to 
be replaced by the Future Siem ens Energy Group (for the preparatory steps, see in detail 
Chapter  V.3.a)). After the Spin -off taking effect and all existing financing arrangements involving 
the Future Siemens Group Companies have been replaced by the Future Siemens Energy Group 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  211 Companie s, there will basically be no further financing arrangements between the Future 
Siemens  Group and the Future Siemens Energy  Group.  
 Cash Management and Cash Pooling  
The system of intercompany clearing accounts and cash management (including cash pooling) 
between the Future Siemens Energy  Group on the one hand and the Future Siemens  Group on the 
other hand will be terminated in connection with the Spin -off taking effect. Therefore, the balances 
from the cash management system between Siemens  AG and Siemens En ergy KG existing at the 
time of termination are settled via external bank accounts. Siemens Energy  KG will operate its own 
cash management system for the future Siemens Energy  Group on the basis of the clearing star 
(Verrechnungsstern ) already set up as pa rt of the Carve -out (in this regard see in detail Chapter 
V.3.b)).  
 Currency, Interest Rate and Commodity Price Hedging Derivatives  
At the latest when the Spin -off taking effect, the Future Siemens Energy Group will independently 
enter into its currency, in terest rate and commodity price hedging derivatives ( Währung -, Zins - und 
Rohstoffpreissicherungsderivate ). The currency, interest rate and commodity price hedging 
transactions concluded by the individual Future Siemens Energy Group Companies with the Futur e 
Siemens Group Companies will be terminated or novated in connection with the Spin -off taking 
effect (in this regard see in detail Chapter  V.3.c)).  
The Future Siemens Energy Group Companies and the Future Siemens Group Companies may 
conclude agreements de viating from the approach above. In particular, it may be agreed that certain 
currency transactions, the term of which extends up to twelve months following the Spin -off taking 
effect , will neither be terminated nor novated.  
 Securities as well as Bank and Group Guarantees  
The patronages and securities provided by Siemens  AG in favor of banks, insurance companies and 
other financial institutions, which have granted loans or provided other financing services 
(derivatives, securities)  to Future Siemens Energy  Group Companies, will be replaced by Siemens 
Energy  AG during the period after the Spin -off tak ing effect (see Chapter  V.3.d)). Until such 
patronages are replaced, the Future Siemens Energy  Group Companies are obliged to pay fees to 
Siemens  AG for t he provision of the patronages. The patronages provided by Siemens  AG will 
expire on 30  April  2021 at the latest. The fees to be paid by the Future Siemens Energy  Group, if 
there is no early replacement, amount to approximately EUR  1 million  in fiscal year  2021.  
The guarantees, sureties  and other securities issued by the Future Siemens Group Companies in 
favor of the Siemens Energy Business and its business partners during the period up until the Spin -
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  212 off takes effect (see Chapter V.3.d) will essentially co ntinue to exist after the Spin -off taking effect . 
Generally, no changes will be made that increase the risk for the Future Siemens Group Companies; 
in particular, they will basically not be increased or extended. Those of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group Co mpanies that originally mandated the issuance of guarantees, sureties  or other securities 
will pay the agreed fees until the respective guarantee, sureties  or other security expires. The 
payment obligations towards Siemens  AG and the Future Siemens  Group a re secured by Siemens 
Energy  KG. The remuneration to be paid to Siemens  AG or other Future Siemens  Group 
Companies for the provision of guarantees, sureties  and other securities for the fiscal year 2021 
will likely amount to an estimated EUR  29 million  (excluding remuneration for guarantees, sureties  
or other securities issued in favor of SGRE). For the following years, the remuneration is expected 
to decrease continuously as the provided guarantees, sureties  and other securities increasingly 
expire.   
 Forfa iting  / Factoring and Finance Leasing  
After the Spin -off has taken effect, it is possible that Future Siemens Group Companies will 
purchase trade receivables against customers from Future Siemens Energy Group Companies, 
assuming the del credere  risk ( Delkr edererisiko ). This is done on the basis of case -by-case 
decisions with no legal purchase obligation for Future Siemens Group Companies and only to the 
extent legally permissible.  
Finance and operating leasing agreements existing at the time of the Spin -off taking effect (see 
Chapter  V.3.g) ) will continue until their contractually agreed termination date. Besides, finance -
leasing agreements will be continued or terminated after the Spin -off takes effect on the basis of 
case-by-case decisions and to the exten t permitted by law.  
 Preferred Financing Agreement  
A Preferred Financing Agreement (" Preferred Financing Agreement ") has been concluded 
between Siemens Energy  KG and Siemens  AG for the period after Loss of Control. The agreement 
governs the cooperation, whi ch is non -exclusive for both parties, in the areas of debt financing, 
commercial financing (especially leasing) and equity financing of customers of the Siemens Energy 
Business (without SGRE; regarding existing arrangements between Future Siemens Group 
Com panies and SGRE, see below Chapter  XI.6.i)) and their projects (including new power 
stations ). Debt financing comprises the provision of debt capital via standard market debt financing 
structures. Standard finance leasing structures can also be the subject  of cooperation. In general, no 
recourse to Future Siemens Energy Group Companies shall be made in connection with debt 
financing and finance leas ing structures.  
The following framework conditions were agreed for equity financing (especially for project 
companies):  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  213  An investment volume of up to EUR  300 million  per fiscal year has been committed by 
Siemens  AG for equity financing for the first five years. For a further five years , it was 
agreed to reinvest any sales revenue from the equity portfolio under the Preferred Financing 
Agreement, but at least EUR  500 million . For equity financing, Siemens  AG's individual 
investment decision follows a portfolio approach which takes into account new investments 
and existing investments.  
 Moreover, in exceptional case s, equity financing can also be provided up to a total volume 
of EUR  210 million  upon full recourse to Siemens Energy KG or Siemens Energy  AG. In 
such cases, profits and losses resulting from the investments will be borne by Siemens 
Energy  KG or Siemens En ergy AG. Siemens  AG bears the risk that recourse to Siemens 
Energy  KG or Siemens Energy  AG may fail (default risk ( Ausfallrisiko )). 
The Preferred Financing Agreement has a fixed term until 30  September 2030. However, each party 
may terminate the agreement with 36 months ' notice, if: (i) the Future Siemens Group (excluding 
the shares held by  SPT e.V.) holds less than 25  % of the voting rights or the capital stock of Siemens 
Energy AG or (ii) another shareholder of Siemens Energy AG holds 25  % or more of the capital 
stock or the voting rights in or exercises control over Siemens Energy AG. A termination in the 
first three years of the term of the Preferred Financing Agreement under (i), however, will result in 
the notice period of 36  months beginning only upon  the third anniversary of the commencement of 
the term of the Preferred Financing Agreement.  
 Financing  / Treasury Services  
Siemens  AG will, at least for a transitional period, provide treasury services against payment to the 
Future Siemens Energy  Group, in  particular software for payment processing, treasury and 
guarantee management on the basis of software as a service agreement.  
 Insurance  
Until 30  September 2021, the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies (with the exception of 
SGRE) will continue to parti cipate in the global insurance programs of the Future Siemens Group 
(in particular construction, property, liability, marine and cyber insurance). For this purpose, 
Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  KG concluded a co -insurance agreement on 25  March 2020. The 
portion of the premiums and fees paid by Siemens  AG for the group insurance programs that relates 
to the Siemens Energy Business will be reimbursed by Siemens Energy  KG to Siemens  AG or paid 
directly to the insurance companies  by the Future Siemens Energy G roup Companies. Only the 
D&O insurance and the other financial lines programs (employment practices liability, crime 
insurance and criminal legal defense cost insurance) will be replaced by policies directly for the 
Future Siemens Energy Group at the lates t upon the Spin -off taking effect.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  214 
 Existing Agreements with SGRE  
The following agreements with SGRE involving Siemens  AG and Future Siemens Group 
Companies will be either terminated or amended when the Spin -off takes effect:  
 To facilitate the settlement of  the exchange of goods and services between the 
Siemens  Group and SGRE, clearing accounts were established at the level of Siemens  AG 
and SGRE S.A. in various currencies. The respective balances on these clearing accounts 
must be settled on a monthly basis . This process will be terminated at the latest with the 
Spin-off tak ing effect . In the future, trade receivables and trade payables will be settled 
directly between the companies concerned.  
 Siemens  AG and other Future Siemens Group Companies have entered into contractual 
arrangements with SGRE for the provision of direct and indirect guarantees, sureties  and 
other securities by Future Siemens Group Companies (see above Chapter  V.3.d)). From 
the time the Spin -off taking effect, the previously agreed guarantee fees will be adjusted 
through a newly concluded agreement which will take into account that Siemens 
Energy  KG has joined SGRE's obligations as joint and several debtor in this respect. The  
expected remuneration to be paid by SGRE to the Future Siemens  Group for the provision 
of guarantees, sureties  and other securities for the fiscal year 2021 will amount to an 
estimated EUR  15 million . Future Siemens Group Companies will not provide any ne w 
guarantees, sureties or other securities after the Loss of Control.  
 Currency, interest rate and commodity price hedging derivatives exist between 
Siemens  AG and other Future Siemens Group Companies  on the one side, and  into with 
SGRE  on the other . These  derivatives will be terminated or novated in connection with the 
Spin-off taking effect (see Chapter  V.3.c) with respect to these variations). In this context , 
the accruing market values of the derivatives may need eventually to be settled on the 
relevant  date. SGRE and the Future Siemens Group Companies may enter into contractual 
arrangements which differ from the approach above. In particular, the parties may agree 
that certain currency positions up until, at the latest, twelve months following the Spin -off 
taking effect  will expire, not be terminated or not be novated. In the future, SGRE will 
enter into derivate positions with external trading partners, potentially on inferior  terms.  
 It is intended to continue t he existing Preferred Financing Agreement with SGRE  and to 
make  a financing commitment for equity financing of projects of up to EUR  200 million  
per year for a period of five years until 30  September  2025 (with respect to the additionally 
existing new Preferred Financing Agreement for the Siemens Energy Business , see 
Chapter  XI.6.f) ). 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  215 7. Research Cooperation Agreement  
On 31  March 2020, Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  KG have concluded an agreement for further 
cooperation in the area of central research and development for so -called Company Core 
Technologies. This agreement shall take effect from the Loss of Control and sh all have a minimum 
term until 31  May 2022. Thereafter, the agreement may be terminated at the end of the then current 
fiscal year by giving a one month's notice and in the following fiscal years by giving an eight 
months' notice to the end of the respectiv e fiscal year; otherwise, the agreement is extended by a 
further fiscal year. Research and development projects can be defined unanimously between the 
parties by a steering committee composed of members of both companies. Regarding these defined 
projects , the parties undertake to perform certain research and development services at their own 
expense and to grant the  respective  other party under certain conditions a license to the brought in 
existing  knowledge and the working results in the respective contra ctually defined business areas . 
An inappropriate allocation of costs and benefits may be compensated for in individual cases, 
whereby a possible compensation of costs will be examined for the first time at the earliest after 
expiry of the minimum contract term. Whether such compensation is paid will in that event be 
negotiated between Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  KG. 
8. Strategic Alliance Agreement  
On 31  March 2020, Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  KG entered into a framework agreement on 
the establishment of a strategic alliance (" Strategic Alliance Agreement "), according to which 
Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG will work trustingly together, also in the future, and always 
in strict compliance with anti -trust and competition law. The Strategic Alliance Agreemen t takes 
effect upon the Loss of Control and has a fixed term until 30  September 2024. If it is not terminated 
duly with three months ' notice, the agreement will extend  for successive one-year terms.  
The Strategic Alliance Agreement envisions a close cooper ation between Siemens AG and Siemens 
Energy KG in various areas and includes the following, separately concluded, or still to be 
concluded, agreements:  
 On 30  March 2020, Siemens AG, Siemens Schweiz AG and Siemens Energy KG entered 
into the Service Agreemen t for Market Development Board (MDB) Data Center & 
Telecommunications Key Account Management. Under this arrangement, Siemens Energy 
KG will receive services from Siemens AG and Siemens Schweiz AG in the area of key 
account management. These services are i ntended to strategically expand and care for the 
business relationships with especially important key customers. The fees to be paid  by 
Siemens Energy KG are variable based on new orders from the key customers. The contract 
provides for fixed terms for the  different areas until 31  May 2021 or 31 May 2022.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  216  The Agreement on Collaboration in the Field of Cybersecurity, which is still to be 
concluded, will provide for the cooperation between Siemens AG, Siemens Energy KG, 
SGRE S.A. and Siemens Healthineers AG in the area of cybersecurity as  legally  permitted. 
In compliance with relevant laws, the parties will form a common cyber security board 
with representatives from all parties in order to exchange and work together regarding 
questions of cybersecurity. The contract will be concluded with an indefinite term and each 
party may terminate upon the end of a fiscal year with three months' notice. The 
cooperation does not involve any monetary compensation.  
 According to the Platform Cooperation Agreement, which was signed on 31  March 2020 
between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG, Siemens Energy KG will present the cloud -
based platform MindSphere, which was developed by Siemens AG, to its customers for 
their use and, upon interest on the part of customers, make the pl atform available. In 
addition, a common committee for platform cooperation will be formed, which shall 
investigate possibilities for combining the parties' products and services in order to open 
up new business areas. Regarding its term and termination pro visions, the agreement refers 
to the Strategic Alliance Agreement. The cooperation does not involve monetary 
compensation.  
 The Strategic Alliance Agreement also comprises the agreement signed  31 March 2020 
between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG regarding  further cooperation in the area of 
central research and development (the so -called R&D Cooperation Agreement regarding 
Research and Development Activities in the field of Company Core Technologies). 
Regarding the content of this agreement, please refer to  Chapter  XI.7.  
Siemens AG and Siemens Energy KG also intend to continue their mutual supply relationships and 
to enter into new framework agreements (so -called Mutual Supply Agreements) for the areas in 
which they have until now mutually supplied each oth er with their respective portfolio products 
and services. The parties intend to confer upon each other preferred supplier status. The Strategic 
Alliance Agreement, independent of subsequent concretizing agreements, further provides that 
Siemens AG and Siem ens Energy KG, in economically relevant cases, will mutually allow for the 
possibility with respect to up to 75  % of its purchasing volume for the other to first provide a 
competitive and market -based  offer for invited supply and service tenders and, in th e case of a 
better, third party offer, to potentially provide a revised proposal (a so -called last call).  
9. Other Relationships  / Other Cooperations  
Even after the Spin -off taking effect, Future Siemens Energy Group Companies will continue to 
purchase goods and services, e.g. pre -products, raw materials and software licenses, from Future 
Siemens Energy Group Companies (and vice versa ) as part of their daily business operations or to 
negotiate jointly. The exact scope of such ongoing business cannot be estimat ed in advance.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  217 Legal relationships between Future Siemens Group Companies and Future Siemens Energy Group 
Companies also result from the Carve -out of the Siemens Energy Business in preparation for the 
Spin-off (see Chapter  V.), which will continue to have effects, in some cases, long after the Spin -
off taking effect.  
 
  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  218 XII. Consequences of the Spin -off for the Employees and their Representative Bodies  
The following section describes the consequences of the Spin -off for the employees and their 
representative bo dies. The Spin -off does not constitute a transfer of business ( Betriebsübergang ) 
or a change of the employer ; however , it does have a certain impact on the employees and their 
representative bodies to the extent that, as a result of the Spin -off of the Spi n-off Assets to Siemens 
Energy  AG and taking into account the Deconsolidation  Agreement concluded at the same time 
(see in detail Chapter  XIII.3.), the Siemens Energy Business will cease to be part of the Siemens 
Group with Siemens  AG as parent company . Siemens Energy  AG will, as an independently listed 
stock corporation, be the parent company  of the Future Siemens Energy Group.  
1. Consequences for the Individual Rights of the Employees  
The employment relationships of the employees of Siemens  AG remain  unaffected by the Spin -off. 
Siemens Energy AG is to date not acting operationally and is not  employing any employees of its 
own.  Therefore, the Spin -off has no consequences for the employees of Siemens Energy  AG. 
The S pin-off also has – unless presented belo w – no consequences for the individual rights of the 
employees of the Future Siemens Energy Group, which will be created,  when the Spin-off takes 
effect with Siemens Energy AG as the new parent company. The employees remain with their 
respective compan y at which they are employed; their employment relationships remain  unaffected 
by the spin -off. This also applies to participation in the company pension plan and the pension 
commitments made by the relevant companies with wh ich the employees are employed.  
With regard to the Spin -off's consequences for claims of employees arising from stock -based 
compensation programs and employee participation programs, please refer to §  11 and §  16 of the 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement attached to this report as Annex and th e explanations in 
Chapter  XIII.1.k).  
Service agreements have been entered into between entities of the Future Siemens Group and the 
Future Siemens Energy Group in connection with the preparation of the transaction under which 
employees of the Future Sieme ns Group provide services for a certain (in general one years') 
transitional period. Such services are to be provided by employees of entities of the Future Siemens 
Energy Group. Therefore, it is currently envisaged that employees of the Future Siemens Gro up 
transfer to the Future Siemens Energy Group either by way of individual contractual basis or by 
virtue of a transfer of business.  
The S pin-off will not result in personnel -related changes. However, the business operations, in 
particular  the organization , the portfolio and the positioning of the Future Siemens Energy Group 
will be monitored on an ongoing basis. In the event that adjustments are to be made to German 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  219 establishments based on the relevant business plan approved at the  time and on the further 
development of the business, the organizational and/or personnel -related changes as well as the 
consequences for the employees will be coordinated with the competent co -determination bodies 
in good time and negotiations pursuant to Sections  111 et seq q. of the German Works Constitution 
Act ( Betriebsverfassungsgesetz , "BetrVG ") will be started in due course.   
There will be no other consequences for the employees other than the individual -law consequences 
of the Spin -off described above, and there are no other measures envisaged in this respect.  
2. Consequences of the Spin -off for Representative Bodies of the Employees  under Works 
Constitution Law , Shop Agreements and Collective Bargaining Agreements  
 Works Councils, Youth and Trainee Representative Bodies and  Handicapped 
Representative Bodies  
 Siemens  AG and Future Siemens Group  
The establishments of Siemens AG and the further establishments of the Future Siemens Group are 
not affected by the spin -off. The existence, composition and terms of office of the exist ing works 
councils  (Betriebsräte ) and general works councils  (Gesamtbetriebsräte ), the existing youth and 
trainee representative bodies and the general youth and trainee representative bodies as well as of 
the handicapped representative bodies and the gene ral handicapped representative bodies remain 
unaffected.  
The group works council  (Konzernbetriebsrat ), the group handicapped representative body and the 
group youth and trainee representative body in the Siemens Group will continue to exist after the 
Spin-off takes effect. However, the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies will leave the 
Siemens Group with the Spin-off taking effect, and Siemens Energy AG will form its own group 
together with its dependent companies. This will lead to personnel changes in the composition of 
the group works council and the group youth and trainee representative body at Siemens AG. 
Accordingly, t hose members of the group works council and the group youth and trainee 
representative body who are employees of the Future Siemens Energy Group will leave those 
bodies when the spin -off takes effect. This currently concerns five members of the group works  
council and five members of the group youth and trainee representative body. The vacant positions 
will be filled with employees of the Future Siemens Group in accordance with the applicable 
statutory provisions.  
The European works council in the Siemens G roup (Siemens Europe Committee) existing under 
the agreement in the version dated 24 March 2020 will also continue to exist after the spin -off takes 
effect. As a result of the departure of the establishments of the Future Siemens Energy Group from 
the Siem ens Group when the spin -off takes effect, however, there will also be personnel changes 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  220 in the composition of that body. Accordingly, those members of the Siemens Europe Committee 
who are employees of the Future Siemens Energy Group will leave that body wh en the spin -off 
takes effect. This currently concerns seven members of the Siemens Europe Committee, who will 
be replaced by substitute members of the Future Siemens Group in accordance with the agreement 
in the version dated 24 March 2020.  
 Siemens Energy  AG and Future Siemens Energy Group  
Since Siemens Energy AG is to date not operationally active and is not employing any employees 
of its own, it has neither a works council nor a youth and trainee representative body nor a 
handicapped representative body.  The spin -off will not directly change this situation. After the spin -
off takes effect, however, Siemens Energy AG will be the parent company of the Future Siemens 
Energy Group. Thus, the prerequisites for establishing a group works council will basically exist at 
Siemens Energy AG pursuant to Section 54 BetrVG . If such a group works council is established, 
the prerequisites for establishing a group handicapped representative body exist pursuant to Section 
180 (2) of the German Code of Social Law Ninth Book  (Sozialgesetzbuch Neuntes Buch , "SGB 
IX"). Furthermore, the prerequisites for establishing a group youth and trainee representative body 
will also exist  in principle  after the spin -off takes effect in accordance with Section 73a BetrVG.  
In the event that a group works council (Konzernbetriebsrat ) is established, group shop agreements 
(Konzernbetriebsvereinbarungen ) existing in the Si emens Group at the time of the S pin-off will 
continue to apply as group shop agreements of the Future Sieme ns Energy Group or otherwise as 
general shop agreemen ts (Gesamtbetriebsvereinbarungen ) or as shop agreements  
(Betriebsvereinbarung ) in the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies that are no longer part of 
the Siemens Group after the S pin-off. 
In addition , the prerequisites for establishing a European works council in the Future Siemens 
Energy Group will, in principle, be met when the Spin -off takes effect.  
The establishments of the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies remain unaffected  by the S pin-
off. The existence, composition and terms of office of these existing works councils and general 
works councils, youth and trainee representative bodies and general youth and trainee 
representative bodies as well as handicapped representative bodies and general han dicapped 
representative bodies remain unaffected.  
 Group Committee, General Committee or Committee of Spokespersons of the 
Senior Executives  
The existence, composition and terms of office of the committees of spokespersons 
(Sprecherausschuss ) and the general committees of spokespersons of the senior executives 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  221 (Gesamtsprecherausschüsse der leitenden Angestellten ) at Siemens  AG remain un affected by the 
Spin-off. 
The group committee of spokespersons (Konzernsprecherausschuss ) in the Siemens Gro up will 
also continue to exist after the Spin-off takes effect. However, Siemens Energy AG and the other 
Future Siemens Energy Group Companies will le ave the Siemens Group when the S pin-off takes 
effect, and Siemens Energy AG will form its own group  togeth er with its controlled companies. 
This will lead to personnel changes in the composition of the group committee of spokespersons of 
Siemens AG. Accordingly, those members of the group committee of spokespersons who are 
employees of Siemens Energy AG or any  of the other Future Siemens Energy Group Companies 
will leave that body when the Spin-off takes effect. This currently concerns two members of the 
group committee of spokespersons. They will be replaced by employees of the Future Siemens 
Group in accordan ce with the applicable statutory provisions.  
Since Siemens Energy AG currently has no business operations, there is no committee of 
spokespersons of senior executives. The Spin-off will not directly change this situat ion either. 
However, after the Spin-off takes effect, the prerequisites for establishing a group committee of 
spokespersons in the Future Siemens Energy Group will in principle exist pursuant to Section 21 
of the German Act on the Committees of Spokespersons of Senior Executives (Gesetz über 
Sprecherausschüsse der leitenden Angestel lten – Sprecherausschussgesetz,  "SprAuG "). 
The committees of spokespersons of the companies of the Future Siemens Energy Group remain  
unaffected by the Spin-off in terms of their existence and composition.  
 Economic Co mmittees  
The economic committees ( Wirtschaftsausschüsse ) existing at Siemens  AG and in other Siemens 
Group Companies continue to exist unchanged after the Spin -off. 
Since Siemens Energy  AG is to dat e not operationally active and does not have  employees, it has 
no economic committee. The Spin-off will not change this situation either.  
The economic committees currently existing at the Future Siemens Energy Group Companies will 
continue to exist unchanged after the Spin -off. 
 Collective Bargaining  Agreements  
The Spin -off will not affect the applic ability  of collective  bargaining  agreements ( Tarifverträge ) to 
Future Siemens Group Companies or Future Siemens Energy Group Companies.  
Siemens AG will continue to be a  member of those employers' associat ions ( Arbeitgeberverbände ) 
of which it currently is a member.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  222 Siemens Energy KG is member of the following employers' associations: Verband der Bayerischen 
Metall - und Elektro -Industrie e.V., Südwestmetall Verband der Metall - und Elektroindustrie 
Baden -Württemberg e.V., Verband der Metall - und Elektroindustrie in Berlin und Brandenburg 
e.V., Essener Unternehmensverband e. V., Unternehmerverband der Metallindustrie Ruhr -
Niederrhein e.V., Hessenmetall - Verband der Metall - und Elektro -Unternehmen Hessen e. V. , 
VSME Verband der Sächsischen Metall - und Elektroindustrie e.V., Nordmetall Verband der 
Metall - und Elektroindustrie e.V., VMET Verband der Metall - und Elektroindustrie in Thüringen 
e.V. Siemens Energy AG currently is not a member of any employers' associ ation, but nor does 
does it currently have any employees.  
 Other Collective Labor Law Consequences  
The Spin -off does not result in any other consequences for the employees or their representative 
bodies under collective labor law other than those described  above, and there are no other measures 
envisaged in this respect.  
3. Consequences  of the Spin -off for Corporate Co -determination and the Supervisory Board  
Siemens AG has an equally co -determined supervisory board in accordance with the provisions of 
the MitbestG. The Spin-off has no effect on the existence and the size of the supervisory board of 
Siemens AG as well as the terms of office of its members. Siem ens AG will continue to be a 
company with an equally co -determined supervisory board with twenty members in accordance 
with the provisions of the MitbestG (ten supervisory board members representing the shareholders 
and ten supervisory board members repres enting the employees). The employee representatives on 
the supervisory board of Siemens AG are elected by the employees of all domestic companies  / 
establishments of the Future Siemens Group located in Germany. Siemens Energy AG and the other 
Future Siemen s Energy Group  Companies  will no longer be group companies of Siemens AG after 
the spin -off takes effect so that employees of Siemens Energy AG and the other domestic 
companies of the Future Siemens Energy Group will no longer be entitled to elect members and to 
be elected as a member of the supervisory board of Siemens AG  and will leave the supervisory 
board of Siemens AG with the Spin -off taking effect , but and instead will be entitled to elect 
members and to be elected as a member of the supervisory boar d of Siemens Energy AG. Currently, 
one employee of the Future Siemens Energy Group is a member of the supervisory board of 
Siemens AG, who will no longer be eligible and will leave the supervisory board of Siemens AG. 
The vacant position will be filled wit h an employee of the Future Siemens Group in accordance 
with the applicable statutory provisions. It is intended to have a successor appointed by a court for 
the period after the vacancy begins until a successor is elected.  
Since Siemens Energy AG does not  have any employees to date, it currently has no supervisory 
board that is subject to statutory employee co -determination. After the Spin-off takes effect, 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  223 however, Siemens Energy AG will establish an equally co -determined supervisory board under the 
provi sions of the MitbestG because it will be the controlling company of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group and, accordingly, will have more than 2,000 employees in Germany based on the provision 
on attributing employees pursuant to Section 5 (1) sentence 1 Mitbes tG. The managing board of 
Siemens Energy AG will conduct so -called status proceedings pursuant to Sections 97 et seq. AktG 
after the spin -off takes effect. The Parties believe that, under the provisions of the MitbestG, 
normally more than 20,000 employees will be deemed to be employees of Siemens Energy AG 
after the Spin-off takes effect and that, accordingly, the supervisory board will consist of twenty 
members pursuant to Section 7 (1) sentence 1 no. 3 MitbestG, of which ten members will represent 
the sha reholders and ten members will represent the employees.  
The ten supervisory board members representing the shareholders will be elected by the 
shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG prior to the Spin-off taking effect  but with effect no 
later than the Spin-off taking effect . They will be initially elected until the registration with the 
register of companies of the amendment of the articles of association in order to adjust the 
composition of the supervisory board so as to comply with the provisions und er German co -
determination law after completion of the status proceedings pursuant to Section 97 AktG. 
Simultaneously, the same supervisory board members representing the shareholders will be elected 
subject to the condition precedent of registration of th is amendment of the articles of association 
with the register of companies for a term of office ending upon conclusion of the next following 
shareholders' meeting. This serves the purpose of facilitating a new election by the future 
shareholders of Siemens  Energy AG of the supervisory board members representing the 
shareholders to be elected by the shareholders' meeting. The supervisory board members 
representing the employees will initially be appointed by a court for a period after the registration 
with t he register of companies of the amendment of the articles of association in order to adjust the 
composition of the supervisory board so as to comply with the provisions under German co -
determination law after completion of the status pro ceedings pursuant to Section 97  AktG until the 
supervisory board members representing the employees are elected by the employees. The Spin-
off has no effects on the existence and composition of the supervisory boards of General Partner 
GmbH, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy Management GmbH and Maschinenfabrik 
Reinhausen GmbH. The supervisory board of General Partner GmbH will continue to be composed 
of twenty supervisory board members, ten members representing the shareholders and ten members 
representing the employees. The s upervisory board of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy 
Management GmbH will continue to be composed of twelve supervisory board members, six 
members representing the shareholders and six members representing the employees. The 
supervisory board of Maschinenfa brik Reinhausen GmbH will continue to be composed of 12 
supervisory board members, six representing the shareholders and six representing the employees.

Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  224 XIII.  Explanation of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement with Annexes  
1. Spin -off and Transfer Agreement  
The Spin-off and Transfer Agreement (" Spin -off and Transfer Agreement ") contains the 
minimum content required under the UmwG for a spin -off by way of reception. In addition, it 
contains optional provisions. The Spin -off and Transfer Agreement is organized in e ight Chapters:  
After the introduction (Chapter  I.), the agreement to the Spin -off, general information on the Spin -
off regarding the Spin -off Effective Date, the Spin-off statements of financial position and the 
closing statements of financial position fol low in Chapter  II. (§§  1-4). In Chapter  III. (§§  5-9), the 
financial consequences of the Spin -off are stipulated , in particular the Spin -off Assets are defined. 
Chapter  IV. (§§  10-12) determines the granting of shares as consideration and provides informat ion 
on special rights and benefits. Chapter  V. (§§  13-15) deals with legal measures in connection with 
the Spin -off, in particular Capital Increases in Kind in order to create the future remaining 
participation of Siemens AG and SBI GmbH in Siemens Energy AG, listing on the stock exchange 
and the creation of capital common for listed companies for Siemens Energy AG. Chapter  VI. 
(§§ 16-18) contains details on the effects of the Spin -off for employees and their representatives. 
Chapter  VII. (§§  19-20) deals w ith the departure of the Future Siemens Energy Group from the 
Siemens Group. Chapter  VIII. (§§  21-22) contains provisions on the allocation of costs and 
standard final provisions.  
Annexes referred to are those of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement. Refere nces to sections not 
describing specific laws are referring sections of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement.  
 Spin -off (§  1) 
§ 1 sentence  1 contains the  constitutive  provision for a spin -off that Siemens AG, as the transferring 
entity, transfers the part of  its assets specified in §  5.1 with all rights and duties as an entirety to 
Siemens Energy AG, as receiving entity, by way of a spin -off by for absorption  pursuant to 
Section  123 (2) no. 1 UmwG. In exchange, the shareholders of Siemens AG are granted Sieme ns 
Energy Shares (see explanations to §  10.1). The transfer by way of a spin -off leads to a so -called 
partial universal succession regarding the Spin -off Assets under Section  131 (1) no. 1 UmwG; 
which means that the Spin -off Assets are transferred by law t o the receiving legal entity, Siemens 
Energy AG, upon registration of the Spin -off with the registers of companies of Siemens AG.  
§ 1 sentence  2 clarifies as a matter of precaution that items which are not attributable to the Spin -
off Assets under the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement or are expressly excluded from the transfer 
under the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement will not be transferred by way of the Spin -off. 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  225 
 Spin -off Effective Date and Fiscal Transfer Effective Date (§  2) 
§ 2.1 sets the Spin -off Effec tive Date on 1  April  2020, 0 .00 hours. The Spin -off Effective Date is 
the point in time as of which the actions and business activities of Siemens AG relating to the Spin -
off Assets are deemed to have been made for the account of Siemens Energy AG (mandato ry 
information pursuant to Section  126 (1) no. 6 UmwG). This means that the Spin -off will be 
economically effective for the purposes of the commercial st atements of financial position as of 
1 April  2020, 0 .00 hours and that Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG  will put each other in the 
positions they would have been in if the Spin -off Assets had already passed legally to Siemens 
Energy AG on 1  April  2020, 0 .00 hours. The transfer in rem  of the Spin -off Assets from Siemens 
AG to Siemens Energy AG occurs on the effective registration of the Spin -off with the registers of 
companies of Siemens AG, the closing date. In this context, §  6.2 provides that Siemens AG will 
ensure that it will only administer and dispose of the Spin -off Assets in the ordinary course of 
business and with the diligence of a prudent businessman in compliance with the provisions of the 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement during the time between the conclusion of the Spin -off and 
Transfer Agreement and the closing date of the Spin -off. 
§ 2.2 refers  to the Fiscal Transfer Effective Date for the Spin -off. Pursuant to Section  2 UmwStG, 
the fiscal transfer effective date results from the closing statements of financial position (see on 
§ 3.1) which are used as the basis for the Spin -off pursuant to Sect ions 125 sentence  1, in 
conjunction with 17  (2) UmwG and is, thus, 31  March  2020, 24 .00 hours.  
 Closing Statements of Financial Position and Spin -off Statements of Financial 
Position (§  3) 
Pursuant to Sections  125 sentence  1 in conjunction with 17  (2) UmwG the so -called closing 
statements of financial position must be attached to the filing with the register of companies of the 
transferring entity (Siemens AG). §  3.1 provides in this regard that the closing statements of 
financial position are the interim st atements of financial position of Siemens AG as of 
31 March  2020, 24 .00 hours . These were prepared in accordance  with the provisions on  annual 
statements  of financial position , audited by the statutory auditor Ernst  & Young GmbH 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellsc haft, Stuttgart  and issued with an unrestricted audit certificate . The 
closing statements of financial position have been approved by the supervisory board of Siemens 
AG on 8  May 2020.  
To assess the Spin -off Assets financially, in accordance with §  3.2 spi n-off statements of financial 
position as of 1  April  2020, 00 .00 hours are attached to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement, which 
is itself Annex to this Spin -off Report, as Annex  3.2. They reflect the assets of Siemens AG passing 
to Siemens Energy AG by w ay of the Spin -off. The spin -off statements of financial position 
themselves were developed from the closing statements of financial position prepared as of 
31 March  2020 which has been carried forward by 1 April 2020, midnight, taking into account the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  226 contribution of a partial partnership interest in the amount of EUR  57,693,148.85 of the Siemens 
Energy KG fixed capital as well as the contribution of the shares with the consecutive numbers 
13,751 to 21,996 of the General Partner GmbH by Siemens AG into Sie mens Energy AG.  
§ 3.3 provides that Siemens AG will include the Spin -off Assets in its commercial closing 
statements of financial position at book value and in its fiscal closing statements of financial 
position at fair market value. Siemens Energy AG wil l include the Spin -off Assets in its commercial 
accounts also at book value (so -called continuation of book values ( Buchwertfortführung )) and will 
incorporate these assets in its fiscal statements of financial position with the value contained in the 
fisca l closing statements of financial position of Siemens AG.  
 Postponement of  the Effective Dates (§  4) 
If the Spin -off has not been registered with the register of companies of Siemens AG by the end of 
the day on 31  October  2020, the Spin -off Effective Date, the Fiscal Transfer Effective Date as well 
as the effective date for the closing statements of financial position of Siemens AG each shift under 
§ 4, i.e. the Spin -off Effective Date will shift to 1  October  2020, 0 .00 hours , and the Fiscal Transfer 
Effecti ve Date as well as the effective date for the closing statements of financial position of 
Siemens AG will each shift to 30  September  2020, 24 .00 hours . In the case of any further delay of 
the registration beyond 31  October of a subsequent year, the above m entioned effective dates each 
shift by a further year (so -called revolving effective date ( rollierender Stichtag )). This provision 
ensures flexibility if the Spin -off no longer takes effect in the fiscal year 2020 of Siemens AG due 
to unforeseen events. Ac cordingly, the dividend entitlement of the shares to be granted as 
consideration for the transfer of the Spin -off Assets is postponed under §  10.2. If the Spin -off has 
not been completed by 31  March  2021, §  22.3 provides a right of withdrawal (see Chapter  XIII.1.t) 
below).  
 Spin -off Assets (§  5) 
The Spin -off Assets consist of the participations of Siemens AG in Siemens Energy KG and in the 
General Partner GmbH set forth in §  5.1. The participations to be transferred consist of a partial 
partnership interest representing a pro rata  amount of EUR  96,199,583.15 of the fixed capital of 
Siemens Energy KG (corresponding to 55  % of the fixed capital of Siemens Energy KG) and of 
13,750 shares in the General Partner GmbH in the nominal amount of EUR  1.00 each 
(corresp onding to 55  % of the share capital of the General Partner GmbH). With the interest in 
Siemens Energy KG, a participation in the amount of 55  % in the Siemens Energy Business is 
transferred directly and indirectly.  
§ 5.1 additionally clarifies that the tra nsfer of the participations includes all related rights and 
duties, respectively. For the interest in Siemens Energy KG this particularly includes the claim to 
all profits not withdrawn so far including the balance assigned to the partnership interest to b e spun 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  227 off on the private account of Siemens AG and the partial amount equal to the share in the fixed 
capital on the joint reserve account of Siemens AG at Siemens Energy KG. With regard to the 
shares in the General Partner GmbH, it is clarified that clai ms to the distribution of profits for shares 
in the General Partner GmbH to be spun off are also transferred. In the fiscal year ending 
30 September  2019, the General Partner GmbH generated a net annual loss in the amount of 
EUR  11,869.82. Siemens Energy K G was first founded on 9  August  2019 and did generate an 
annual result in the amount of EUR  0 in its short fiscal year.  
§ 5.2 regulates that Siemens Energy AG assumes  a liability amount (Haftsumme ) from Siemens 
AG equivalent to  the amount of the partnershi p interest in the fixed capital to be spun off.  
§ 5.3 stipulates that outstanding obligations of Siemens AG to make contributions to Siemens 
Energy KG remain unaffected and are to be borne by Siemens AG, irrespective of the contribution 
of a partial partnership interest of Siemens AG (see Chapter  XIII.2 .a)) to be contributed to Siemens 
Energy AG. The background to this provision is that Siemens AG, in connection with the transfer 
of a minority share in Siemens Ltd., India, has made the commitment, in the event that the purchase 
price exc eeds the initiall y contributed amount, to subsequently make a corresponding contribution 
to Siemens Energy KG in the amount of the difference to any additional purchase price (for further 
details, see Chapter  V.1.e)cc) ). This contribution obligation is supposed to be fulfi lled by Siemens 
AG and not by Siemens Energy AG.  
§ 5.4 regulates as a catch -all provision the obligation of the parties to make all declarations, to issue 
all certificates and to carry out all actions which might be necessary or appropriate in connection 
with the transfer of the Spin -off Assets.  
 Taking Effect , Closing Date (§  6) 
The change in rem  in ownership of the partnership interest in Siemens Energy KG and the shares 
in the General Partner GmbH including the related rights and duties takes place as an entirety by 
force of law pursuant to Section  131 (1) no. 1 UmwG upon the registration of the  Spin-off with the 
register of companies of Siemens AG at the district court of Charlottenburg and the district court 
of Munich. The later of the two registrations is determinative. The date of the effective registration 
is defined as the " Closing Date ". The Closing Date is, thus, different from the Spin -off Effective 
Date (1  April  2020, 0 .00 hours).  
Siemens AG undertakes in §  6.2 to ensure, that no shareholders' resolutions shall be adopted prior 
to the Closing Date under which the fixed capital of Siemens  Energy KG or the share capital of the 
General Partner GmbH existing at the time of conclusion of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement 
is changed. Siemens AG also undertakes to ensure, that no capital from  Siemens Energy KG or 
dividend payouts from the Gene ral Partner GmbH are withdrawn prior to the Closing Date. Hereby, 
it is ensured that all assets of the Siemens Energy Business are transferred economically to Siemens 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  228 Energy AG. Overall, such provisions serve to secure the share participation ratios intend ed for 
when the Spin -off takes effect as well as a reasonable share allocation ratio and, thus, the protection 
of the Siemens Shareholders.  
Finally, §  6.2 regulates the duties of Siemens AG in the transition period between the conclusion 
of the Spin -off an d Transfer Agreement and the Closing Date with regard to the Spin -off Assets. 
This regulation provides that Siemens AG will ensure that the items constituting the Spin -off Assets 
are only administered in the ordinary course of business and with the diligen ce of a prudent 
businessman and these items are not disposed of. This provision protects Siemens Energy AG and 
the Siemens Shareholders as well.  
 Catch -all Provisions (§  7) 
§ 7.1 as a purely precautionary measure, contains a catch -all provision in the event  that the Spin -
off Assets are not already transferred to Siemens Energy AG by force of law. In this case, Siemens 
AG transfers Spin -off Assets which might as an exception not pass to Siemens Energy AG by force 
of law by a separate agreement with in rem  effect to Siemens Energy AG. Siemens Energy AG is 
required to consent to the transfer. The two companies will treat each other in their internal 
relationship as if the transfer had occurred in their external relationship as of the Spin -off Effective 
Date.  
§ 7.2 supplements §  7.1 by providing that Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG will initiate all 
necessary or appropriate measures and legal actions in connection with the transfer under §  7.1 and 
that they must cooperate in order to transfer the Spin -off Assets.  
 Protection of Creditors and Internal Compensation (§ 8) 
Pursuant to Section  133 (1) and (3)  UmwG, Siemens AG is jointly and severally liable with 
Siemens Energy AG for the performance of the liabilities transferred to Siemens Energy AG if 
these liabilitie s become due within five years after the announcement of the registration of the Spin -
off with the registers of companies of Siemens AG and claims are asserted against Siemens AG in 
court or in any other way stipulated by Section  133 UmwG or judicial or of ficial enforcement is 
effected or applied for. §  8.1 determines in this regard as a supplement to the statutory provision 
that Siemens Energy AG must indemnify Siemens AG on first demand if and to the extent that 
creditors assert claims against Siemens AG under transferred liabilities, obligations or contingent 
liabilities . The same provision applies in the event that claims are asserted by creditors against 
Siemens AG to provide security for such liabilities, obligations or contingent liabilities . However,  
consideration must be  given to the fact that no liabilities, obligations or contingent liabilities  are 
being directly spun off from Siemens AG.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  229 In the reverse situation, Siemens Energy AG is jointly and severally liable with Siemens AG for 
the performance  of the liabilities remaining with Siemens AG which had already been established 
prior to the Spin -off taking effect pursuant to Section  133 (1) and (3)  UmwG if the liabilities 
become due within five years after the announcement of the registration of the Spin-off with the 
registers of companies of Siemens AG and resulting claims are asserted against Siemens Energy 
AG in court or in any other way described in Section  133 UmwG or judicial or official enforcement 
is effected or applied for. To the extent that  claims are asserted under these liabilities against 
Siemens Energy AG, Siemens AG will indemnify Siemens Energy AG on first demand against the 
respective liability or obligation pursuant to §  8.2 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement. The 
same situation applies in the event that creditors assert claims against Siemens Energy AG to 
provide security for such liabilities, obligations or relationships resulting in liability.  
This is a standard provision between the entities involved on the internal compensati on of the 
liability under Section  133 UmwG. With this statutory provision, the legislature intends to prevent 
in the external relationship with the creditors that they are deprived of liable capital by a spin -off. 
§ 8.3. of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreem ent additionally  provides that Siemens Energy AG must 
indemnify Siemens AG on first demand from  any obligation, debt or liability if the liable 
contribution ( Hafteinlage ) in Siemens Energy KG provided by Siemens AG is considered repaid 
to Siemens AG or any other measure described in Section  172 (4) sentence  2 HGB is exercised 
after the Closing Date, without Siemens AG or its subsidiaries actually receiving the liable 
contribution. This applies in particular if the notice  of succession ( Rechtsnachfolgevermerk ) has 
not or not timely been registered with the register of companies. The background of this provision 
is that Siemens AG, in case of a payout of the liable contribut ion to Siemens Energy KG, can 
possibly be liable to creditors of Siemens Energy KG for a period of five years after leaving 
Siemens Energy KG in the amount of the liability sum ( Haftsumme ) regarding the company 
liabilities existing at the time of the share  transfer. §  8.3 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement 
stipulates  a precautionary rule for this case.  
 Warranties (§  9) 
§ 9 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement conclusively regulates the claims of Siemens 
Energy  AG under warranties regarding the Spin -off Assets and excludes the statutory provisions to 
the extent legally permissible. Excluding the cases described in §  9, the liability of Siemens AG 
will be limited to the mandatory level provided under the law.  
Siemens AG warrants  to Siemens Energy  AG in §  9.1 that Siemens AG is the holder of the partial 
partnership interest  in Siemens Energy KG to be spun off to Siemens Energy AG and the shares in 
the General Partner GmbH on the Closing Date and is entitled to freely dispose of these shares and 
interest an d that the shares and interest are not encumbered with rights of third parties. Under §  9.1, 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  230 no further quality is agreed with regard to the Spin -off Assets. By way of precaution , it is also 
clarified that no specific qualities or value of the business of Siemens Energy KG are agreed.  
§ 9.2 excludes to the extend  legally perm issible any claims, rights and warranties which might exist 
pursuant to statutory law or otherwise in addition to those in §  9.1. 
 Issuance of Shares, Trustee and Capital Measures (§  10) 
§ 10.1 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement regulates the consideration for the transfer of the 
Spin-off Assets  pursuant to  Section  126 (1) no. 3 and 4  UmwG . According to this provision, the 
shareholders of Siemens AG are granted one share of no-par val ue (registered share) in Siemens 
Energy AG for every two shares of no-par value  (registered shares) in Siemens AG according to 
their participation existing so far (preserving the proportionate participations). Altogether, the 
shareholders of Siemens AG are  granted 399,654,856 shares of no-par value  (registered shares) in 
Siemens Energy AG. The fact that the  50,690,288 shares held by Siemens AG as treasury shares 
are not entitled to allocation  under Section  131 (1) no. 3 sentence  1 UmwG was  therefor  taken into 
account. Siemens AG will make sure that at the time when the Spin -Off takes effect  the number of 
the total issued shares in Siemens AG minus the treasury shares which are not entitled to an 
allocation pursuant to Section  131 (1) no. 3 sentence  1 UmwG amounts to exactly 799.309.712 . 
This assures that the new shares in Siemens Energy AG contemplated for implementing the Spin -
off are sufficient to make an allocation to all Siemens Shareholders who are entitled to an allocation. 
To the extent necess ary, the exact adjustment of the number of shares entitled to an allocation will 
take place by acquiring or selling treasury shares by Siemens AG on the stock exchange.  
The Siemens Energy shares to be issued to the shareholders of Siemens AG are entitled t o 
participate in profits for the fiscal years starting on 1  October  2019 (Section  126 (1) no. 5 UmwG) 
pursuant to §  10.2 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement. If the Spin -off Effective Date shifts 
pursuant to §  4, the beginning of the right to participat e in profits for the Siemens Energy shares to 
be granted also shifts accordingly (see above on §  4). 
§ 10.3 regulates how the shares that are supposed to be issued to the shareholders of Siemens AG 
as consideration will be created. In order to implement th e Spin -off, Siemens Energy AG will 
increase its capital stock by EUR  399,654,856 by issuing 399,654,856 shares of no-par value  
(registered shares) in Siemens Energy AG. A portion of EUR  1.00 in the amount of the capital 
stock increase is attributable to ea ch new share. An additional premium (agio) is not agreed and is 
therefore not owed The Spin -off can only be registered according to the provisions of the UmwG 
after the implementation of this capital increase has been registered with the register of compan ies 
of Siemens Energy  AG (Sections  125 sentence  1, 66, 130  (1) sentence  1 UmwG).  
§ 10.4 clarifies that the contribution in kind will be rendered by transferring the Spin -off Assets. 
§ 10.4 also regulates the accounting treatment for a value of the contribu tion in kind that exceeds 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  231 the nominal amount of the issued shares. To the extent that the value at which the contribution in 
kind rendered by Siemens AG is assumed by Siemens Energy AG, i.e. the book value of the Spin -
off Assets as of the Spin -off Effectiv e Date under commercial law, exceeds the amount of the 
increase in the capital stock of Siemens Energy AG set forth in §  10.3, this amount will be allocated 
to the capital reserve of Siemens Energy AG pursuant to Section  272 (2) no. 1 HGB.  
Under Sections  125 sentence  1, 71 (1) sentence  1 UmwG, the transferring entity must appoint a 
trustee to receive the shares to be granted. §  10.5 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement provides 
that Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt am Main, will be appointed as  trustee for the receipt of the shares 
in Siemens Energy AG to be issued and to distribute them to the shareholders of Siemens  AG. The 
possession of the shares to be issued  will be granted  to Deutsche Bank AG prior to registration of 
the Spin -off. At the s ame time, Deutsche Bank AG will be instructed to provide  the shareholders 
of Siemens AG  with the shares after registration of the Spin -off with the registers of companies of 
Siemens AG.  
 Grant ing of Special Rights (§  11) 
Pursuant to Section  126 (1) no. 7 UmwG, the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement must contain 
statements about rights which the receiving entity or the transferring entity (at the legal entities 
choice pursuant to Section  133 (2) sentence  2 UmwG) grants to the holders of special rights (for 
examp le stock options, non -voting shares, preferred shares, shares with multiple voting rights, 
bonds, profit sharing rights). Furthermore, statements about the measures contemplated for these 
persons must be made.  
There are special rights at Siemens AG and fur ther Siemens Group Companies in the form of rights 
under stock -based compensation programs and employee participation programs . 
§ 11.1 introductorily states that Siemens Group Companies have made various awards or may make 
such awards before the Spin -off takes effect under stock -based compensation programs and 
employee participation programs for shares of no-par value  (registered shares) in Siemens AG 
(together  the "Stock Entitlements ") to members of the managing board and employees of Siemens 
AG as well as members of the corporate bodies and employees of Siemens Group Companies, 
including members of corporate bodies and employees of Future Siemens Energy Group (together, 
the "Beneficiaries "). 
This involves especially (i) so -called stock awards, i.e. commitments to transfer Siemens Shares 
and, as the case may be,  to an additional payment in cash for a mathematical number of Siemens 
Share s be which – depending on the specifics – depend solely on remaining in the Siemens Group 
or the occurrence of certain further prerequisites and (ii) commitments under the share matching 
program and the basis share program which grant the Beneficiary a claim for one Si emens Share 
for each certain amount of Siemens Shares he previously acquired with own funds and which the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  232 Beneficiary holds for a certain holding period and (iii) awards under the UK plan, according to 
which a trustee holds Siemens Shares acquired by the B eneficiaries with own funds and Siemens 
Shares transferred by the respective company in this regard and  / or Siemens Shares acquired by 
reinvesting dividends for the Beneficiaries.  
All of these Stock Entitlements are normally granted in annual, part ly also in quarterly tranches. 
Furthermore, awards of shares with regard to certain jubilees (jubilee shares) exist at Siemens 
Group. A list of the currently existing Stock Entitlements stating the group of Beneficiaries and the 
legal basis of the respective comm itment is attached as Annex  11.1 to the Spin -off and Transfer 
Agreement, which is itself Annex to this Spin -off Report.  
The number of shares for which still pending Stock Entitlements according to Annex  11.1 to the 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement (which is  itself Annex to this Spin -off Report) currently exist 
(effective date: 30  April  2020) is a total of approximately  14,430  million  for the Siemens Group 
overall, of which there are a total of approximately 2,69 million  in the Future Siemens Energy 
Group. Th ese statements of volume cover no commitments made after 30  April  2020. The 
statements of volume also cover no awards for jubilee shares for which these statements of volume 
would not have any relevance simply due to the lack of adjustment in the course of  the Spin -off (on 
this point immediately below).  
Section  23 UmwG in conjunction with Section  125 sentence  1 UmwG provides that in the case of 
a spin -off, the holders of rights in the transferring entity which do not grant voting rights must be 
granted equi valent rights in the receiving entity. Pursuant to Section  133 (2) sentence  2 UmwG, 
these rights can also be granted in the transferring entity in the case of a spin -off. The Stock 
Entitlements, to the extent granted by Siemens AG, are to be regarded as su ch rights in the 
transferring legal entity (special rights). Therefore, Beneficiaries who have received such Stock 
Entitlements are entitled by law to be granted equivalent rights. Even if the Stock Entitlements were 
granted by subsidiaries of Siemens AG, they entitle the Beneficiaries to be granted  equivalent rights 
in the event of a spin -off. Since the equivalent rights in the present case can and should be granted 
by the company which has made the existing Stock Entitlements, this is technically an adjus tment 
of the existing Stock Entitlements and not the grant of new awards in order to establish the 
equivalency of the Stock Entitlements after the Spin -off takes effect with the Stock Entitlements 
prior to when the Spin -off takes effect. In any event, only  establishing the "equivalency"is required 
by the law, not the establishment of the same type or same functionality. However, the legal right 
to the granting of equivalent rights (or adjustment of the existing Stock Entitlements) exists only to 
the extent nothing else is provided in the stipulations forming the basis of the specific Stock 
Entitlement.  
The adjustment of existing rights as a grant of equivalent rights within the meaning of 
Section  23 UmwG in conjunction with Section  125 UmwG takes place outsi de of the Spin -off and 
Transfer Agreement. Pursuant to Section  126 (1) no. 7 UmwG, the Spin -off and Transfer 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  233 Agreement must, however, contain statements about the rights which the receiving entity or the 
transferring entity grants to holders of special rig hts. These statements are found in §  11.1 and 
§ 11.2 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement as well as in the Annexes  11.2.1 and 11.2.2 to the 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement; they are only describing and do not constitute a legal basis for 
granting the eq uivalent rights. The grant takes place by the responsible companies and the 
responsible corporate bodies; therefore, by the supervisory board of Siemens AG for the members 
of the managing board of Siemens AG.  
Under these legal requirements and by considera tion of  the provisions forming the basis of the 
individual Stock Entitlements, the grant of equivalent rights or the adjustment of the existing Stock 
Entitlements takes place as follows:  
 The Beneficiaries in the Future Siemens Energy Group, who leave the Siemens Group with 
the Spin -off taking effect because the ir employer company leaves the Siemens Group, will 
receive a cash compensation  or a cash payment for the Stock Entitlements from this 
company. However, this does not apply to the Beneficiaries under the UK plan, who 
receive for shares already held by the trustee – as all other Siemens Shareholders as well – 
Siemens Energy Shares, which they may then – without pro rata temporis  reduction – 
withdraw and utilize. The claim for such a cash compensation  or such a cash payment 
results from the underlying provisions which contemplate a cancellation of the Stock 
Entitlements of the employed Beneficiaries in exchange for a cash compensation  or a cash 
payment in the case of a company leaving the Siemens Group. T his cash compensation  or 
the cash payment takes place after the Spin -off takes effect. The amount of the cash 
compensation  or the cash payment is determined in each case on the basis of the provisions 
underlying the Stock Entitlements. Depending on the awa rd for each Siemens Share or a 
mathematical Siemens Share, the cash payment or the cash compensation is calculated on 
the basis of the closing price for the Siemens stock on the date when the Spin -off takes 
effect, i.e. the relevant registration with the r egister of companies, thus, cum Siemens 
Energy, but – for the Stock Entitlements – after deduction of the present value of the 
dividends expected up to the respective end of the lock -up period. A specific quantification 
of these present values is currently  not possible, among other reasons, simply because the 
underlying interest rates, but also because the relevant stock prices when the Spin -off takes 
effect are not yet known. For the share matching program and the basis share program, 
there will be no dedu ction of the present value of the anticipated dividends, but the amount 
will be reduced on a pro rata temporis  basis calculated on the basis of the stock price by 
that portion which corresponds to the portion of the remaining term of the holding period 
after the Spin -off takes effect compared to the total duration of the holding period. This 
means, for example, that if the relevant stock price is EUR  90 and the Spin -off takes effect 
after one year and 10 months (= 22 months), a holding period of three years  (= 36 months) 
therefore results in a claim to cash off -set or cash payment of EUR  90 x 22/36 = EUR  55. 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  234 It should be noted that the example shown is a simplified illustration only and that the 
share -matching  program and the basis share program are based on  a calculation to the day. 
If – as in the case of the Siemens stock awards – the number of shares to be granted or the 
specific award from a Stock Entitlement is dependent on the achievement of certain targets, 
a target achievement of 100  % is taken as the  basis for determining the cash payment. To 
the extent that there is an agreement otherwise for certain groups of members of executive 
bodies or employees or for individual members of executive bodies or employees or if a 
cash compensation  or a cash paymen t is excluded, there will not be any off -set payment or 
cash payment or such a payment will be governed by the different provisions. With an 
unchanged number of Stock Entitlements as of 30  April 2020, an assumed closing price of 
the Siemens Share in Xetra trading of EUR  90 and the Spin -off taking effect on 
25 September 2020, the portion of the total costs of the cash compensation or the cash off -
set to be borne by the Future Siemens Energy Group is estimated at approximately 
EUR  140 million  (gross);  this is  off-set by the savings of costs which would be incurred 
over the remaining term in the case of normally fulfilling the Stock Entitlements. A 
quantification of this savings is not possible simply because the relevant stock prices for 
this purpose cannot be  forecast.  
 In general , Stock Entitlements for Beneficiaries, who do not leave the Siemens Group as a 
consequence of the Spin -off, will be adjusted. Only in the case of the UK plan is an 
adjustment beyond the regulations in the UK plan not necessary, since the Beneficiaries 
receive Siemens Energy AG Shares for the shares already held by the trustee – like all other 
Siemens Shareholders. The adjustment takes place by that company which is required to 
do so under the respective Stock Entitlement when the Spin -off takes effect. The 
adjustment takes place by payment of a cash amount when the respective Stock Entitlement 
falls due. The determination of the cash amount occurs in such a manner that – in the first 
conceptual step - each Beneficiary receives awards fo r Siemens Energy AG  Shares  in 
addition to the Stock Entitlements for Siemens Shares or mathematical Siemens Shares at 
the allocation ratio of 2:1 that applies to the Siemens Shareholders in accordance with 
§ 10.1 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement, and  then – in a second conceptual step – 
these awards are converted to a cash amount. Aside from this, the cash payment occurs 
only when the relevant Stock Entitlements are normally due or if they become due early 
(for example in certain cases of leaving the employment relationship), without regard to 
whether the Stock Entitlements are fulfilled with Siemens Shares or by a cash payment on 
the basis of an authorization in the underlying provisions. Thus, the specific provisions of 
the respective Stock Entitleme nts, including any lock -up periods or holding periods, early 
due dates, provisions on loss or adjustments or other prerequisites apply. This means, for 
example that a Beneficiary who has a claim for 30 Siemens Shares after the expiration of 
a certain holdi ng period under a share matching program will receive a cash payment for 
15 shares in Siemens Energy AG in addition to the 30 Siemens Shares when this claim 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  235 becomes due (subject to the further prerequisites in the share matching program). The 
amount of the  cash payment is based on the specific underlying provisions of the Stock 
Entitlement which apply for any cash payment instead of the transfer of Siemens Shares, 
provided, however, that the respective share price of the shares in Siemens Energy AG and 
not the respective share price of the Siemens stock is determinative. Under this adjustment, 
the Beneficiaries are placed economically in the position they would have been in if they 
already held Siemens Shares at the time when the Spin -off takes effect for wh ich they 
would then receive, just as every other Siemens Shareholder, additional shares in Siemens 
Energy AG in accordance with the allocation ratio when the Spin -off takes effect and 
would then have to hold these shares in each case for the remaining term  of the Stock 
Entitlement or until the Stock Entitlement becomes due early, without regard to the tax 
consequences and any dividend payments. This adjustment applies in the same manner if 
fractional shares result mathematically on the basis of the allocati on ratio. Aside from this, 
this adjustment does not affect the obligation to invest in Siemens Shares that applies under 
the share -matching  program. To the extent that the Beneficiaries receive shares in Siemens 
Energy  AG– as any other shareholder - after the Spin -off becomes effective due to their 
investment in Siemens Shares made in this way, they are not subject to any holding 
obligation. If the number of the shares to be transferred or the specific claim under certain 
Stock Entitlements depends on achie ving certain targets and if this achieving of targets is 
influenced, among other factors, by how the stock exchange price for the Siemens Shares 
develops compared to the stock exchange prices for certain other companies or how the 
market price of the Sieme ns stock, including dividends distributed, develops in comparison 
with the development of the stock yield according to a specific industry index, the target 
achievement parameters will be adjusted after expiration of the respective vesting  period, 
but only  if and to the extent necessary to establish the equivalence of the Stock Entitlements 
(within the meaning of Sections  23 and 125  UmwG) before and after the Spin -off for the 
Beneficiaries. This depends, in turn, on the specific effects of the Spin -off on t he stock 
exchange price of Siemens AG and its further development. If the objectives are already 
achieved without adjustment, no adjustment is required. An adjustment of the awards for 
jubilee shares does not take place in accordance with the underlying ag reements. To the 
extent that, in a specific case for certain groups of members of corporate bodies or 
employees or for individual members of corporate bodies or employees, there is a different 
agreement or an adjustment has been excluded or if an adjustmen t with regard to regulatory 
requirements in jurisdictions outside of Germany is not made, there is no adjustment as 
describe above.  
The intention is to apply the above principles in the same manner if and to the extent that other 
Stock Entitlements are gra nted in the context of the stock -based compensation programs or 
employee participation programs after conclusion of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement but prior 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  236 to the Spin -off taking effect. Where appropriate, such Stock Entitlements are granted in accor dance 
with these principles.  
The adjustments described above are implemented by the company, which is obliged under the 
respective Stock Entitlements when the Spin -off takes effect. Agreements between Siemens Group 
Companies on the technical processing of adjustments or internal load bearing remain unaffected 
by this. Pursuant to Section  133 (2) sentence  1 UmwG Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG are 
jointly and severally liable to Beneficiaries who have received Stock Entitlements directly from 
Siemens AG for  the performance of the obligations to grant equivalent rights under 
Section  125 sentence  1 in conjunction with Section  23 UmwG. §  11.2.3 of the Spin -off and 
Transfer Agreement accordingly provides for the corresponding application of §  8 of the Spin -off 
and Transfer Agreement for the internal relationship between the two contracting parties so that a 
claim for indemnification against the respective other party exists if claims are asserted against one 
party for a liability under the adjustment or for a com pensation or off -set for Stock Entitlements 
which the other party must bear in the internal relationship. Regulations regarding  the internal load 
bearing can be found in the Master Separation Agreement and in any further agreements between 
the parties or t he group companies (regarding the Master Separation Agreement see Chapter  XI.2.).  
§ 11.3 states that Siemens AG has not issued any convertible bonds or warrant bonds at the time of 
signing the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement. Therefore, there is no need fo r a provision regarding 
rights that Siemens Energy AG must grant to the holders of such rights.  
§ 11.4 clarifies that besides the aforementioned provisions, no rights are granted to individual 
shareholders or holders of special rights within the meaning of  Section  126 (1) no.  7 UmwG and 
that no measures within the meaning of the regulation are provided for such persons.  
 Grant ing of Special Benefits (§  12) 
§ 12.1 points out as a precautionary matter that there is an intention to secure the prospectus liability 
risks with regard to the listing prospectus for the stock exchange by means of a so -called IPO 
insurance policy which can be obtained in the market. Under the standard terms and conditions, 
such insurance policies also cover as insured persons th e members of the managing board and the 
supervisory board of the issuer. Corresponding insurance contracts can only be concluded relatively 
shortly before the listing on the basis of a well advanced listing prospectus. Therefore, details of 
the insurance c overage including the amount of coverage and the insurance premium are not yet 
fixed.  
§ 12.2 points out that the current chairman of the managing board of Siemens AG, Joe Kaeser, and 
the member of the managing board Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas shall assume po sitions in the 
supervisory board of Siemens Energy AG after the Spin -off takes effect, whereas Joe Kaeser shall 
be proposed as chairman of the supervisory board and Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas as chairman of the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  237 audit committee. Moreover, it is pointed out th at the members of the supervisory board receive in 
addition to a possible committee remuneration a fixed annual remuneration in the amount of 
EUR  120,000 per member which increase s by EUR  120,000 for the chairman of the supervisory 
board. For the work in t he audit committee , the chairman  additionally  receives EUR  120,000. The 
supervisory board of Siemens AG decided in its meeting on 8 Mayi 2020 that the remuneration of 
Joe Kaeser and Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas as supervisory board member of  Siemens Energy AG 
shall not be deducted from the ir remuneration as managing board members of  Siemens AG.  
§ 12.3 points out that the members of the managing board of Siemens Energy AG have been 
promised in advance of the Spin -off the granting of a spin -off incentive, thus a transaction bonus, 
by the General Partner GmbH. Accordingly, amounts ranging from  100 % to 200 % of a target 
amount individually determined for each member of the managing board can be paid out  subject to 
the target being achieved . The target amount is EUR 1,500,000 for Dr. -Ing. Christian Bruch and 
EUR 750,000 each for Dr. -Ing. Jochen Eickholt, Maria Ferraro and Tim Oliver Holt. The target 
amount will be paid out if certain target values for the effects of the spin -off or the market value 
are achieved upon the spin -off taking effect and within the first 120 days after the spin -off taking 
effect, based on the average volume -weighted price of the Siemens Energy share. If these target 
values are not achieved, no spin -off incentive will b e granted. If the target values are exceeded, a 
maximum of up to 200 % of the target amount will be paid out. Values between 100 % and 200 % 
are determined by linear interpolation. The members of the managing board are obliged to reinvest 
the net profits f rom the spin -off incentive in Siemens Energy shares. It is intended that the 
obligation to pay managing board remuneration, including the spin -off incentive, will be transferred 
to Siemens Energy AG after the spin -off takes effect.  
§ 12.4 clarifies that Ge neral Partner GmbH has granted the members of the management of the 
General Partner GmbH due to their activities as members of the managing board of Siemens 
Energy  AG commitments to receive shares without own additional payment after a vesting period 
(stoc k awards) in addition to their other remuneration. Thereby, a part of the remuneration shall be 
structured  for the long term by measuring the achievement of financial and non -financial targets 
over a period of four years. By granting stock awards , the inte rest of the members of the managing 
board of Siemens Energy AG in a long -term increase of the company value is strengthened. 
Moreover, the identification of the beneficiaries with the interests of the shareholders and the 
ownership culture is strengthened (with regard to the details of the planned arrangement of the 
stock -based payment programs , refer to the explanations in Chapter  X.4.d).  
§ 12.5 points out that the Spin -off at hand may insofar affect the existing stock -based payment 
programs  for the member s of the managing board of Siemens AG as these depend amongst other 
things on the development of the share price of Siemens AG and the share price of Siemens AG 
could develop differently as a result  of the Spin -off.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  238 § 12.6 clarifies for the sake of comple teness that, aside from the above, no special benefits within 
the meaning of Section  126 (1) no. 8 UmwG are being granted to members of the managing board 
or the supervisory board of the companies involved in the Spin -off or to an auditor of the financial 
statements or a spin -off auditor.  
 Articles of Association of Siemens Energy AG and Authorization under Section  71 
(1) no. 8 AktG and Authorization under Section  221 AktG (§  13) 
§ 13.1 contains the obligation of Siemens AG, as the sole shareholder or rather  as the indirect sole 
shareholder of Siemens Energy AG  after implementation of the Capital Increases in Kind, to ensure 
that the articles of association of Siemens Energy AG are amended prior to the Spin -off taking 
effect so that the articles of association are given the version attached as Annex  13.1 to the Spin -
off and Transfer Agreement after the Spin -off takes effect and the status proceedings have been 
conducted. The articles of association of Siemens Energy AG contain the standard provisions  for a 
listed company. Reference is made to the explanations in Chapter  X.4.c).  
Pursuant to §  13.2, Siemens AG also undertakes, as the sole shareholder or  rather as the indirect 
sole shareholder of Siemens Energy AG  after implementation of the Capital Incr eases in Kind,  to 
ensure that the authorization attached as Annex  13.2 for the acquisition  and use of treasury shares 
in a total amount of up to 10  % of the capital stock existing at the time the authorization takes effect 
pursuant to Section  71 (1)  no. 8 AktG is resolved. Such an authorization is also standard for a listed 
company (see with regard to the content of the authorization and the procedure, the explanations in 
Chapter  X.4.i)).  
Furthermore, in § 13.3 Siemens AG undertakes, as the sole shareholder  or rather as the indirect sole 
shareholder of Siemens Energy AG after implementation of the Capital Increases in Kind,  to ensure 
that an authorization to issue convertible  / warrant bonds in accordance with Section  221 AktG 
prior to the Spin -off taking ef fect is resolved. The convertible  / warrant bonds involve bonds under 
Section  221 (1) sentence  1 AktG under which the holders or creditors are granted a right to 
exchange or subscribe to shares. The resolution with which the managing board of Siemens Energ y 
AG is authorized to issue convertible  / warrant bonds and the supervisory board of Siemens Energy 
AG is authorized to amend §  4 of the articles of association (capital stock and shares) accordingly 
is attached as Annex  13.3 to the Spin -off and Transfer A greement (see with regard to the content 
of the authorization, the explanations in Chapter  X.4.h)).  
The aforementioned provisions will provide Siemens Energy AG with instruments common for a 
listed company for debt and equity capital funding.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  239 
 Capital Incre ases in Kind of Siemens Energy AG (§  14) 
§ 14.1 regulates, w ith regard to the resolutions to increase the capital in kind described in §  0.5 of 
the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement to create the remaining shareholding of Siemens  AG and SBI 
GmbH of 45  % of the capital stock in Siemens Energy AG , that Siemens AG and the Siemens 
Energy  AG will ensure that  all declarations  are made , all documents are issued and  all actions are 
taken that are necessary or useful to effect the capital increase before the Spin -off takes effect. This 
provision therefore ensures that Siemens  AG and Siemens Energy  AG will complete  the Capital 
Increases in Kind in the manner intended.  
§ 14.2 stipulates that no further capital increases or any capital decreases shall be carried out in 
Siemens Energy  AG until the Spin -off takes effect - with the exception of the Spin -off Capital 
Increase to create the shares to be issued in connection with the Spin -off (see §  10.1 above) and the 
Capital In creases in Kind to create the remaining shareholding of Siemens  AG and SBI GmbH of 
45 % in the capital stock of Siemens Energy  AG - and that Siemens  AG must ensure compliance 
with this provision.  
 Admission to  Stock Exchange Trading (§ 15) 
Immediately after  the Spin -off taking effect , the fungibility of the Siemens Energy  Shares is to be 
ensured through admission to stock exchange trading. This is intended to ensure that the Siemens 
Shareholders are granted equivalent rights. §  15 obliges the contracting par ties to take all required 
or expedient steps to admit the Siemens Energy Shares to trading on the regulated market of the 
Frankfurt Stock Exchange and, in addition, in the prime standard sub -segment of the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange.  
 Consequences of the Spin -off for the Employees and their Representative Bodies 
(§ 16 to §  18) 
According to the mandatory provision in Section  126 (1) no. 11 UmwG, the Spin -off and Transfer 
Agreement itself must contain statements about the consequences of the spin -off for the emp loyees 
and their representative bodies as well as the measures which are contemplated in this regard. These 
statements are found specifically in §§  16 and 18 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement. These 
provisions contain no contractual agreements between  the contracting parties to the Spin -off and 
Transfer Agreement and instead only contain a description of the consequences of the Spin -off 
which result in part directly under the law and in part also under corresponding agreements between 
the employer and the employees as well as claims under stock -based compensation programs or 
employee participation programs. Reference is made to the explanations in §§  16 and 18 of the 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement (Annex to this Spin -off Report) and Chapter  XII of this  Spin-off 
Report.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  240 
 Termination of the Controlling  Influence (§  19) 
§ 19 states that Siemens AG, Siemens Energy AG and SBI GmbH have concluded an agreement 
on the restriction of the exercise of voting rights in the shareholders ' meeting of Siemens 
Energ y AG by Siemens AG and SBI GmbH, the Deconsolidation  Agreement (the Deconsolidation  
Agreement is attached to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement as Annex  19; for further 
explanations of the Deconsolidation  Agreement, please refer to Chapter  XIII.3.). The 
Decons olidation  Agreement is intended to enter into effect with suspensive condition of the Spin -
off taking effect. . In addition, §  19 clarifies the purpose of the agreement, namely that Siemens AG 
will no longer exercise a controlling influence within the meani ng of Section  17 AktG on Siemens 
Energy AG after the Spin -off taking effect.  
 Group  Separation Agreement (§  20) 
At the same time as the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement, Siemens AG and Siemens Energy  AG 
have concluded a Group Separation Agreement pursuant to §  20 with the content set forth in 
Annex  20 to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement. The Corporate Separation Agreement governs 
the legal relations between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy  AG for the period from the 
effectivene ss of the Spin -off and the associated departure of the Siemens Energy Business, 
including Siemens Energy  AG from the Siemens Group. This is set forth in §  20. With regard to 
the content of the Group Separation Agreement, reference is made to the statements  in 
Chapter  XIII.4.  
 Costs and Transaction Taxes (§  21) 
§ 21 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement contains provisions on costs and transaction taxes. 
The parties assume that as a consequence of the conclusion and execution of the Spin -off and 
Transfer Agr eement no VAT is incurred and that they will cooperate to prevent a possible 
determination of VAT. Should, contrary to the assumption, VAT be incurred, Siemens Energy AG 
is only obligated to payment to Siemens AG regarding VAT if and to the extent only as it is able 
to deduct the respective VAT as input tax. To the extent that VAT is imposed on Siemens 
Energy  AG and Siemens Energy AG is not entitled to pre -tax deduction, Siemens AG shall 
indemnify Siemens Energy AG from and against VAT and any interest ther eon. Siemens AG bears 
the costs incurred and to be incurred on the level of Siemens  Energy AG upon notarization of the 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement and its implementation up to the Closing Date (including the 
costs for the respective shareholders ' meeti ng and the costs for filings and registrations with the 
register of companies, the joint Spin -off Report, the spin -off audit and the audits in connection with 
capital increases in kind and post -formation and planned listing as well as the corresponding cos ts 
for advisors instructed Siemens Energy AG, banks and insurances) and transaction taxes (except 
for VAT which is specified in §  21.1 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  241 
 Final Provisions (§  22) 
§ 22 contains various standard final provisions. §  22.1 determines that the Spin -off and Transfer 
Agreement only takes effect when the shareholders ' meeting of Siemens AG and the shareholders ' 
meeting of Siemens Energy AG have approved the agreement.  
§ 22.2 states that the managing board of Siemens AG must ensu re that the Spin -off only takes effect 
when the Capital Increases in Kind have also become effective through registration  in the register 
of companies of Siemens Energy AG.  
§ 22.3 contains a provision on withdrawal under which each contracting party can wi thdraw from 
the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement by written declaration issued to the other contracting party if 
the registration with the registers of companies of the contracting parties has not occurred by the 
end of 31  March  2021. Thus, there is a legal  possibility to break off the implementation of the Spin -
off if, for example unforeseen events occur which substantially delay the implementation of the 
planned measures. In this event, the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement additionally provides a 
revolving Spin-off Effective Date in §  4 (see above on §  4). 
§ 22.4 contains an additional cooperation obligation according to which Siemens AG must, if 
necessary, grant access to Siemens Energy AG to all business documents relating to items 
constituting the Spin -off Assets (i.e. Siemens Energy KG and the General Partner GmbH).  
Furthermore  § 22.5 provides  that in general all disputes in connection with the Spin -off and 
Transfer Agreement or about its validity including those relating to termination or subsequent 
amen dments will be finally decided excluding the jurisdiction of state courts (with the exception of 
measures of interim relief) by arbitration proceedings under the rules of arbitration of the 
International Chamber of Commerce (" ICC") as amended at the  time.  
§ 22.6 clarifies that the Annexes also constitute part of the contract.  
§ 22.7 contains a contractual limitation clause. Claims arising from the Spin -off and Transfer 
Agreement shall thus become time -barred on 31 December 2030.  
§ 22.8 contains a standard c lause on written form.  
§ 22.9 involves the standard provision on replacing any invalid or unenforceable provisions in the 
contract in a reasonable manner (so -called severability clause).  
2. Contribution Agreement (Annex  0.5.3 to the Spin -off and Transfer Agre ement)  
The contribution agreement attached as Annex  0.5.3 to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement is 
explained and described below (the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement including its Annex  0.5.3 is 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  242 attached to this Spin -off Report as Annex). The background a re the Capital Increases in Kind to 
create the participation in the amount of 45  % of the future capital stock of Siemens Energy AG 
which will remain directly and indirectly via SBI GmbH with Siemens AG when the Spin -off takes 
effect. The contribution agre ement regulates the contributions in kind to be made by Siemens  AG 
and SBI GmbH in order to create this participation.  
The first Chapter of the contribution agreement (§§  1 and 2) defines the contribution in kind of 
Siemens AG and the next Chapter (§§  3 and 4) defines the contribution in kind of SBI GmbH. Both 
regulate the respective transfer in rem and determine the consi deration to be paid. The concluding 
Chapter (§§  5 to 14) contains common regulations for the respective contributions in kind of 
Siemens AG and SBI GmbH. The contribution agreement has the following material content:  
 Subject of the Contribution and Transfe r of Siemens AG (§  1) 
§ 1.1 exactly determines the contribution in kind of Siemens AG, namely a limited partial 
partnership interest representing a pro rata  amount of EUR  57,693,148.85 of the fixed capital of 
Siemens Energy KG (the " Limited Partnership Int erest to be contributed by Siemens AG ") as 
well as 8,246 shares in the General Partner GmbH, which are listed in the list of shareholders of 
the General Partner GmbH with the numbers 13,751 through 21,996 (" General Partner Shares to 
be contributed by Sieme ns AG "). 
§ 1.2 stipulates that the Limited Partnership Interest to be contributed by Siemens AG is transferred 
together with all associated rights and obligations, including the claim to all profits not yet 
withdrawn and including the balance in the private account of Siemens AG to be allocated on a pro 
rata basis to the Limited Partnership Interest to be contributed by Siemens AG and the pro rata  
amount in the joint ly held  reserve account corresponding to the pro rata  amount of the fixed capital. 
The General Partner Shares to be contributed by Siem ens AG are transferred including the claim 
to profit distribution for all profits not yet distributed . 
§ 1.3 regulates that outstanding obligations of Siemens AG to make contributions to Siemens 
Energy KG remain unaffected and are to be borne by Siemens AG , irrespective of the contribution 
of the Limited Partnership Interest to be contributed by Siemens AG to Siemens Energy AG. The 
background to this provision is that in connection with the transfer of a minority interest in S iemens  
Ltd, India, S iemens  AG has made a promise to Siemens Energy  KG to make a contribution to 
Siemens Energy  KG for a purchase price that exceeds a previously defined basic purchase price for 
the shares to be acquired.  (for further details, see Chapter  V.1.e)cc)). This contributi on obligation 
is to be fulfilled by Siemens AG and not by Siemens Energy AG.  
§ 1.4 contains provisions on the execution in rem  of the contribution in kind of Siemens AG. For 
this purpose, Siemens AG assigns the Limited Partnership Interest to be contribute d by Siemens 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  243 AG and the General Partner Shares to be contributed by Siemens AG (as defined in §  1.1) to the 
accepting Siemens Energy AG.  
Pursuant to §  1.5, the assignment is subject to the condition precedent that the transfer of the 
Limited Partnership In terest to be contributed by Siemens AG is registered with the register of 
companies of Siemens Energy KG.  
§ 1.6 clarifies that Siemens Energy AG, upon assignment of the Limited Partnership Interest to be 
contributed by Siemens AG, also assumes a liability sum ( Haftsumme ) and thus a liable 
contribution ( Hafteinlage ) of Siemens AG in the amount of the assumed fixed capital participation.  
 Consideration for Siemens AG (§  2) 
Pursuant to §  2, Siemens AG shall receive 239,582,401 no-par value shares (registered sh ares) in 
Siemens Energy AG with a proportionate amount of the capital stock of EUR  1.. Further details are 
set forth in §  6. In addition, Siemens AG shall receive as further consideration an amount of 
EUR  175,746.41 ( plus interest credited to bank accounts  and intragroup clearing accounts of 
Siemens Energy AG from 1  April 2020 up to and including the date of disbursement or minus 
interest debited during this period ) as cash payment, which shall become due upon registration of 
the capital increase with the r egister of companies of Siemens Energy AG. The payment of the 
additional amount ensures that all other assets of Siemens Energy AG are paid out and that the 
exact value of the assets is established at a ratio of 45 to 55 between the assets of Siemens Energ y 
AG brought in under the contribution agreement and the Spin -off Assets (for further details, see 
Chapter  VII.).  
 Subject of the Contribution and Transfer of SBI GmbH (§  3) 
§ 3 contains provisions on the contributions in kind by SBI GmbH and corresponds in  its structure 
to the regulations in §  1 on the contributions in kind by Siemens AG. The assets under the 
contribution in kind of SBI GmbH comprise the entire limited partnership interest of SBI GmbH in 
Siemens Energy KG representing a pro rata  amount of E UR 21,015,601 of the fixed capital as well 
as all 3,004 shares of SBI GmbH in the General Partner GmbH, which are listed in the list of 
shareholders of the General Partner GmbH with the numbers 21,997 through 25,000.  
 Consideration for SBI GmbH (§  4) 
According to §  4, SBI GmbH receives 87,307,936 no-par value shares (registered shares) in 
Siemens Energy AG with a pro rata  amount of the capital stock of EUR  1.00 each as consideration 
for the contribution pursuant to §  3. Further details are set forth in  § 6.

Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  244 
 Contribution Effective Date, Fiscal Transfer Effective Date (§  5) 
The provision on the contribution effective date in §  5.1 reflects the provisions on the Spin -off 
Effective Date (see Chapter  XIII.1.b)) to align the creation of the final shareholding  ratios in 
Siemens Energy AG. The contribution effective date is 1  April  2020, 0 .00 hours . If the respective 
assignments pursuant to §  1.4 and §  3.4, which are to be made before the Spin -off takes effect, have 
not taken effect by the end of 31  October  2020  by registration with the register of companies of 
Siemens Energy KG (or waiver of this condition precedent pursuant to §  11), the contribution 
effective date shall be 1  October  2020, 0 .00 hours . If the respective assignments do not become 
effective by the  end of 31  October of the following year, the respective contribution effective date 
shall be postponed by one year to 1  October, 0 .00 hours of the following year.  
In § 5.2, the fiscal transfer effective date is set on 31  March  2020, 24 .00 hours (in accord ance with 
the regulation on the Fiscal Transfer Effective Date of the Spin -off). The fiscal transfer effective 
date will be postponed accordingly if the contribution effective date is postponed. Furthermore, 
§ 5.2 contains an obligation of Siemens Energy A G to submit an application in accordance with 
Section  20 (5) sentence  1, (6)  sentence  3 UmwStG in due time after the assignments have become 
effective pursuant to §  1.4 and §  3.4, thereby creating a tax retroactive effect on the tax transfer 
date.  
 Capital Increases (§  6) 
§ 6.1 stipulates that Siemens Energy AG shall increase its capital stock from EUR  100,000 by 
EUR  239,582,401 to EUR  239,682,401 by issuing 239,582,401 no-par value shares (registered 
shares) in favor of Siemens AG and then again, excluding the subscription  right , from 
EUR  239,682,401 by EUR  87,307, 936 to EUR  326,990,337  by issuing 87,307,936 no-par value 
shares (registered shares) in favor of SBI GmbH. Each new no -par value share shall represent 
EUR  1.00 of the amount of the capital stock increase. The issue occurs at a nominal value of 
EUR  1.00 respectively; an additional agio is not owed. T he contribution agreement does not 
stipulate – in contrast to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement – that Siemens Energy AG carries 
forward the book values of Siemens AG and SBI GmbH in relation to the contributions in kind.  
§ 6.2 regulates profit entitleme nt of the new shares to be issued. In principle, the shares are entitled 
to participate in profits as of 1  October  2019; however, if the contribution effective date is 
postponed to 1  October  2020, the entitlement to participate in profits will also be post poned to 
1 October  2020 and, in the event of further postponements of the contribution effective date, by 
one additional year in each case.  
For fiscal purposes, §  6.3 stipulates that a book value continuation is to be chosen for the 
contribution in kind of  SBI GmbH and for the contribution in kind of Siemens AG.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  245 
 Warranty (§  7) 
§ 7 contains a standard warranty clause according to which Siemens AG and the SBI GmbH 
respectively guarantee their ownership and the freedom from encumbrances of the contributions in  
kind, but otherwise do not guarantee the quality or value. Any other rights and warranties are 
excluded to the extent permitted by law.  
 No Capital Increase s, No Withdrawal (§  8) 
§ 8 contains an obligation similar to §  6.2 of the Spin -off and Transfer Agre ement (see  in detail  
Chapter  XIII.1.f)) to ensure that until the assignments under §  1.4 and §  3.4 have been executed in 
rem, the fixed capital of Siemens Energy KG and the share capital of the General Partner GmbH 
shall not be changed and no withdrawals o r profit distributions shall be made at these companies. 
Furthermore, Siemens AG and SBI GmbH undertake to ensure that the contribution in kind assets 
of Siemens AG and the contribution in kind assets of SBI GmbH will only be administered and 
disposed of i n the ordinary course of business and with the diligence of a prudent businessman in 
compliance with the provisions of the contribution agreement.  
 Indemnification of the Limited Partner's Liability (§  9) 
§ 9 contains an indemnification agreement identical in content to §  8.3 of the Spin -off and Transfer 
Agreement (for further details see Chapter  XIII.1.h)).  
 Registration with the Register of Companies (§  10) 
§ 10 contains an obligation for mutual cooperation between the contracting parties to file the 
necess ary registrations with the register of companies and to make the necessary declarations in 
accordance with §§  1.5 and 3.5.  
 Waiver of Condition s (§ 11) 
§ 11 enables Siemens AG and SBI GmbH to effect a transfer in rem  of the contribution in kind 
assets pursuant to §§  1.5 and 3.5 with immediate effect by waiving the condition precedent of 
registration with the register of companies through notarized notices to Siemens Energy AG 
without having to wait for the registratio n with the register of companies. This gives the parties 
additional flexibility with regard to the execution of the contributions and the Spin -off, in case of 
any delays in registrations with the register of companies.  
 Costs and Transaction Taxes (§  12) 
§ 12 contains provisions on costs and transaction taxes.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  246 The parties assume that as a consequence of the conclusion and execution of the contribution 
agreement no VAT is incurred and that they will cooperate to prevent a possible determination of 
VAT. Shoul d, contrary to the assumption, VAT be incurred, Siemens Energy AG is only obligated 
to a payment to Siemens AG regarding VAT if and to the extent only as it is able to deduct the 
respective VAT as input tax. To the extent that VAT is imposed on Siemens Ene rgy AG and 
Siemens Energy AG is not entitled to pre -tax deduction, Siemens AG shall indemnify Siemens 
Energy AG from VAT and any interest thereon.  
Siemens bears the costs of the notarization of the Contribution Agreement. Further, Siemens AG 
bears the cost s already incurred and costs that will be incurred by Siemens  AG and  
Siemens  Energy  AG in connection with the notarization of the contribution agreement and its 
implementation up to the point in time of registration with the register of companies (includin g the 
costs for the audit of the contribution in kind and the post -formation examination as well as the 
respective relating costs for advisors, the costs for the shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy 
AG and the costs for filing and registration with the register of companies) and transaction taxes 
(except for VAT which is specified in §  12.1 of the contribution agreement).  SBI GmbH shall bear 
its own costs already incurred  and its own costs that will be incurred.  
 Effectiveness (§  13) 
The effectiveness of the contribution agreement is subject to the condition precedent of the 
completion of the post -formation procedure pursuant to Section  52 AktG, specifically the approval 
of the shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy AG to the contribution agreement and it s 
registration with the register of companies as post -formation agreement. This removes any 
uncertainties regarding the validity of the contribution agreement. The post -formation procedure is 
to be initiated and completed shortly  after the conclusion of th e contribution agreement.  
 Final Provisions (§  14) 
§ 14 contains the standard final provisions. §  14.1 contains a standard provision according to which 
the contracting parties shall initiate and participate in all necessary or expedient measures and legal 
acts for the implementation of the contribution agreement. §  14.2 allows the parties to withdraw 
from the contribution agreement if the Capital Increases in Kind are not completed by the end of 
31 March  2021. Disputes in connection with the contribution agr eement or concerning its validity 
shall pursuant to §  14.3 be finally decided by way of arbitration proceedings pursuant to the rules 
of arbitration of ICC in their respective current version  and without recourse to the regular. §  14.4 
contains a standard clause on written form. §  14.5 contains the standard provision for replacing any 
invalid or unenforceable provision of the contribution agreement (so -called severability clause).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  247 3. Deconsolidation  Agreement (Annex  19 to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement)  
The Siemens Energy Business shall be managed by Siemens Energy  AG autonomously and 
independently of Siemens  AG (see Chapters  III.1. and III.4.). Siemens  AG does not intend to exert, 
directly or indirectly, controlling influence on Siemens Energy  AG. Followi ng the effectiveness of 
the Spin -Off, the Siemens Energy Business shall no longer be fully consolidated  in Siemens  AG's 
consolidated financial statements. Given the fact that there is no majority shareholding of Siemens 
AG, it will not be assumed that Siem ens Energy  AG is still controlled by  Siemens  AG pursuant to 
Section  17 (2) AktG after the Spin-Off taking effect . In the event , which cannot be completely ruled 
out, that Siemens  AG directly and indirectly, specifically via the shares held by SBI  GmbH, wil l 
hold the majority of the shares entitled to vote and represented at future shareholders' meetings of 
Siemens Energy  AG, Siemens AG and SBI GmbH have ensured through the Deconsolidation  
Agreement attached to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement as Annex  19 that the Future Siemens 
Group will no longer be able to exercise a controlling influence on the Siemens Energy Business 
and Siemens Energy AG after the Spin -off takes  effect. The Deconsolidation  Agreement provides 
three main elements for this purpose:  
 In general, the number of voting rights that can be exercised by Siemens AG and SBI 
GmbH at the shareholders' meetings of Siemens Energy AG for resolutions affecting the 
composition of the supervisory board is limited to the extent that Siemens AG (together 
with affiliated companies and certain other related parties) can no longer exercise a 
majority of the votes and unilaterally enforce decisions against the other shareholders of 
Siemens Energy AG (stated in §  1 of the Deconsolidation  Agreement, see 
Chapter  XIII.3.a)).  
 In addition, Siemens AG undertakes to ensure that the supervisory board of Siemens 
Energy AG on the shareholder's side will include a maximum of three representatives who 
are dependent on Siemens AG and the Future Siemens Group (as defined in mo re detail in 
the Deconsolidation  Agreement) (governed by §  2 of the Deconsolidation  Agreement, see 
Chapter  XIII.3.b)). The majority of the shareholder representatives on the supervisory 
board of Siemens Energy AG shall therefore be independent of Siemens A G in the future.  
 For one supervisory board member (the so -called special supervisory board member 
(besonderes Aufsichtsratsmitglied )), who must be independent of Siemens AG, Siemens 
AG and SBI GmbH will exercise only a further reduced number of their votes  on 
appointment and dismissal compared to the general restriction on the exercise of voting 
rights of a maximum of 60  % of the voting presence of the other shareholders at the 
shareholders' meeting (regulated in §  3 of the Deconsolidation  Agreement, see 
Chapter  XIII.3.c)).  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  248 In addition, the Deconsolidation  Agreement regulates the transfer of shares in Siemens Energy AG 
within the Future Siemens Group (§  4 of the Deconsolidation  Agreement ), the enforcement of 
obligations by other shareholders of Siemens Energy AG (§  5 of the Deconsolidation  Agreement) 
as well as concluding provisions, in particular on the term, modalities of termination of the 
agreement and standard final provisions (§§  6-8 of the Deconsolidation  Agreement).  
References to sections not describing specific laws are referring sections of the Deconsolidation 
Agreement. The main provisions of the Deconsolidation  Agreement are explained below.  
 General Restrictions on the Exercise  of Voting Rights (§  1) 
In § 1.1, Siemens AG and SBI GmbH undertake to exercise voting rights in the shareholders ' 
meeting of Siemens Energy AG only up to a certain maximum number of votes on the specified 
subjects of resolution. To the extent that possibl e subjects of resolution are not covered by the 
enumerative catalogue in §  1.1, Siemens AG and SBI GmbH may exercise all their voting rights in 
a vote at the shareholders ' meeting. The subjects of resolution to which the restriction of voting 
rights applie s relate to:  
 The appointment and removal of the supervisory board members (§ 1.1 lit. a)): Siemens 
AG and SBI GmbH shall not be in a position to decide alone on the composition of the 
shareholder representatives  on the supervisory board.  
 Management measure s pursuant to Sections  83, 111  (4) sentences  3 to 5, 111b  (4), 119  (2) 
or 179a AktG (§  1.1 lit. b)) : By way of exception, the managing board may either 
voluntarily submit certain management measures to the shareholders ' meeting 
(Sections  111 (4) sentences  3 to 5, 111b (4), 119 (2)  AktG), or is even obliged to do so 
under certain conditions (Sections  83 and 179a  AktG). In all these cases, Siemens AG 
together with SBI GmbH shall not be able to decide alone on the implementation of such 
management measures.  
 The discharge  of the members of the managing and supervisory boards ( Entlastung ) and a 
vote of no confidence ( Vertrauensentzug ) in respect of managing board members  (§ 1.1 lit. 
c)): Siemens AG and SBI GmbH shall not be able to decide on these issues alone, a s this 
could indirectly influence the work and decisions of the administration.  
 The remuneration of the supervisory board members (Section  113 (3) AktG) and the 
remuneration system for the executive board members (Section  120a AktG) including a 
possible re duction of the remuneration under Section  87 (4) AktG  (§ 1.1 lit. d)): This 
should also avoid indirect influence on the work of the corporate bodies.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  249  The approval of the annual financial statements if the shareholders' meeting resolves on 
such approval by way of exception pursuant to Section  173 AktG (§ 1.1 lit.  e). 
§§ 1.2 and 1.3 provide the maximum number of votes that Siemens AG and SBI GmbH may 
exercise for the subjects of resolution listed in §  1.1 (subject to the provisions on special supervisory 
board members ( besondere Aufsichtsratsmitglieder ) in §  3) and their calculation. The basic concept 
is that Siemens AG, SBI GmbH and certain persons closely related to Siemens AG shall not be able 
to exercise more votes in the shareholders ' meeting in relation to the subjects of resolution in §  1.1 
than all other shareholders present or represented together.  
§ 1.2 therefore stipulates that, prior a resolution pursuant to §  1.1, the number of votes held by the 
other shareholders present or re presented at the relevant shareholders' meeting is to be determined 
based on the  detected  last presence of the shares entitled to vote at the shareholders' meeting prior 
to the vote, including shares for which the voting rights were cast by postal vote. Fo r this purpose, 
Siemens  AG's shares and the shares attributable to Siemens  AG in Siemens Energy  AG shall be 
deducted from the presence (as described in more detail below):  
 The " Siemens  AG's shares" in Siemens Energy AG: These are all shares present at the 
shareholders' meeting and held by Siemens AG or another company affiliated with Siemens 
AG and party to the Deconsolidation  Agreement; in addition to Siemens AG, this initially 
includes SBI GmbH, but this group may expand in the future due to the accession  of further 
Future Siemens Group Companies to the Deconsolidation  Agreement pursuant to §§  4.2 
and 4.3.  
 The "shares attributable to Siemens  AG": Present shares in Siemens Energy AG held or 
represented by certain parties related to Siemens AG are considered  as such in the 
shareholders' meeting: These include shares held by companies that are controlled by  
Siemens AG (pursuant to Section  17 AktG) or subsidiaries within the meaning of the 
IFRS  10 (Annex  A), to the extent that the holder of such shares is not i tself a party to the 
contract and has therefore already been taken into account and deducted under the 
"Siemens  AG's shares". This also includes shares held by SPT e.V. or other pension 
schemes, pension funds, support funds or investment funds serve the pu rpose of providing 
company pension or implementing remuneration and participation programs for employees 
of Siemens  AG and/or its affiliated companies (pursuant to Sections  15 et seqq. AktG). 
Finally, shares are included that are held by members of the man aging board of 
Siemens  AG or members of SBI  GmbH's board of managing directors, and shares of which 
the voting right is exercised at Siemens Energy  AG's shareholders' meeting by members of 
the managing board of Siemens  AG or members of SBI  GmbH's board of managing 
directors, since these also exercise the voting rights of Siemens AG and SBI GmbH at the 
same time.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  250 § 1.3 regulates the "maximum number of Siemens  AG's voting rights", i.e. voting rights may be 
exercised by Siemens  AG and SBI  GmbH for resolutions pursuant to §  1.1. The maximum number 
of Siemens  AG's voting rights shall be determined by deducting from the other shareholders ' voting 
presence (pursuant to §  1.2) (i)  votes corresponding to 10  % of the other shareholders ' voting 
presence and (ii)  votes attached to present shares that are deemed shares attributable to 
Siemens  AG. The underlying logic is that the shares of Siemens AG, SBI GmbH and all shares 
attributable to Siemens AG should have a substantially lower voting weight than the shares of all 
other shareholders present together. Therefore, a flat -rate deduction of 10  % of the voting presence 
of the other shareholders is first made from the voting presence of the other shareholders. The 
voting rights attached to the shares attributable to Siemens  AG may be freely exercised by the 
respective shareholders; however, Siemens AG and SBI GmbH allow these shares to be counted as 
own shares, so that these shares are also to be deducted at the expense of Siemens AG and SBI 
GmbH. The remaining number then r epresents the maximum number of voting rights that may be 
exercised by Siemens AG and SBI GmbH.  
This procedure can be illustrated by the following example:  
 For instance, the total presence at the shareholders' meeting amounts to 70  % of the capital 
stock.  
 Shares amounting to approximately  23.08  % of the capital stock are held by Siemens AG, 
shares amounting to approximately  12.02  % of the capital stock are held by SBI GmbH 
and shares amounting to 9.9  % of the capital stock are held by SPT  e.V. Siemens AG, SBI 
GmbH and SPT  e.V. are present with all their shares.  
 The voting presence of the remaining shareholders thus amounts to 25  % of Siemens 
Energy AG's capital stock (total presence of 70  % minus the shares of Siemens AG, SBI 
GmbH and SPT  e.V.).  
 The maximum  number of Siemens  AG's voting rights (as defined in the Deconsolidation  
Agreement) is therefore 12.6  % of the capital stock: voting presence of the other 
shareholders amounting to 25  % of the capital stock minus (i)  2.5 percentage points (10  % 
of the voti ng presence of the other shareholders) minus (ii)  9.9 percentage points (shares 
attributable to Siemens  AG; here 9.9  % of the capital stock held by SPT e.V.)  
 As a result, Siemens AG and SBI GmbH together may only exercise votes amounting to 
12.6 % of the c apital stock from their combined votes of 35.1  % of the capital stock. For 
SPT e.V., there are no restrictions with regard to the voting rights from its shares amounting 
to 9.9  % of the capital stock under the Deconsolidation  Agreement.

 Maximum Number of R epresentatives of Siemens  AG in the Supervisory Board of 
Siemens Energy  AG (§  2) 
Under §  2.1 Siemens AG and SBI GmbH undertake to ensure that at all times no more than three 
supervisory board members depending on Siemens  AG are members of Siemens Energy  AG's 
supervisory board representing the shareholders.  
§ 2.2 conclusively regulates the persons deemed as dependent  on Siemens  AG: 
 Persons who are or have been in the past two years, counting as from the date of the 
respective shareholders' meeting, members o f the managing bodies of Siemens  AG, of 
SBI GmbH, of another subsidiary as defined by IFRS  10 (Annex  A) or of an affiliated 
company of Siemens  AG pursuant to Sections  15 et seqq.  AktG, of an associate company 
(as defined in IAS  28 no.  3) of Siemens  AG or o f a joint venture company (as defined in 
IAS 28 no.  3) of Siemens  AG. However, the exclusion does not cover members of 
supervisory bodies, in particular not members of Siemens AG's supervisory board.  
 Persons who are or have been in the past two years, coun ting as from the date of the 
respective shareholders' meeting, employees of Siemens  AG or an affiliated company 
(pursuant to Sections  15 et seqq.  AktG) of Siemens  AG. 
 Persons who are relatives (as defined in Section  15 AO) of a current managing board 
membe r of Siemens  AG. 
 Persons who, based on a decision adopted by the supervisory board of Siemens Energy  AG 
in accordance with its duties, cannot be considered as independent, because (i) they may 
currently have a personal or business relations with Siemens  AG, or an affiliated company 
of Siemens  AG, that may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interests 
(within the meaning of Section  C.9 of the DCGK), (ii) the supervisory board of Siemens 
Energy  AG therefore believes that the supervisory b oard member (or a candidate for 
membership on the supervisory board) is not independent (within the meaning of the 
DCGK) of Siemens  AG; and (iii) the supervisory board of Siemens Energy  AG has 
published  this assessment  in its election proposal ( Wahlvorschl ag), in a declaration of 
compliance ( Entsprechenserklärung ) with the DCGK or in comparable publications. 
Conditions (i) to (iii) must be met cumulatively.  
§ 2.3 lists by way of example and in a non -exhaustive manner measures to be taken by Siemens 
AG and  / or SBI GmbH in order to fulfill the obligation regulated under §  2.1: 
 In the event of an election of the supervisory board, Siemens AG and SBI GmbH will not 
vote for candidates that are depending on Siemens  AG to the extent that, as a consequence 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  252 of their  election, more than three shareholder representatives on the supervisory board of 
Siemens Energy  AG would be depending on Siemens  AG. 
 Siemens AG and SBI GmbH will not submit election proposals for elections to the 
supervisory board  to the shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy  AG and will ensure that 
affiliated companies of Siemens  AG (Sections  15 et seqq. AktG) do not submit election 
proposals to the extent that, assuming that these election proposals and furthermore the 
election proposals of the super visory board of Siemens Energy  AG are accepted, as a 
consequence and following their election, there would be more than three shareholder 
representatives on the supervisory board of Siemens Energy  AG who are depending on 
Siemens  AG. 
 In the event of a court  appointment of supervisory board members pursuant to 
Section  104 AktG, Siemens AG and SBI GmbH will not exercise the shareholders ' rights 
such that, as a result of the court appointment, there will be more than three shareholder 
representatives on the sup ervisory board of Siemens Energy  AG who are depending on 
Siemens  AG. 
 Siemens AG and SBI GmbH will exert influence on members of management bodies or on 
employees of Siemens  AG or its affiliated companies, e.g. by refusing a required approval 
for the assump tion of a secondary function, such that these members will not accept a 
mandate as supervisory board member if otherwise there would be more than three 
shareholder representatives on the supervisory board who are depending on Siemens  AG. 
 Restrictions on the Exercise of Voting rights for the Special Supervisory Board 
Member (§ 3)  
When electing, re -electing and voting on the removal of a supervisory board member (including a 
substitute member of that supervisory board member), the so -called special supervis ory board 
member ( besonderes Aufsichtsratsmitglied ), Siemens  AG and SBI  GmbH will only vote with a 
further reduced voting power. Under §  3.1 Siemens  AG and SBI  GmbH undertake to Siemens 
Energy AG to exercise the voting right attached to Siemens  AG's shares  only in the following 
manner: The voting right attached to Siemens  AG's shares may be exercised for not more than the 
"reduced maximum number of voting rights of Siemens  AG. " The reduced maximum number of 
voting rights of Siemens  AG is to be determined b y deducting from the other shareholders ' voting 
presence (i)  40 % of the votes of the other shareholders ' voting presence and (ii)  votes attached to 
shares that are present and that are deemed to be shares attributable to Siemens  AG. Therefore, a 
larger de duction is made compared to the provision in §  1.3. 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  253 § 3.2 clarifies that the special supervisory board member and, where applicable, a substitute 
member appointed for that special supervisory board member must not be a person depending on 
Siemens  AG (withi n the meaning of § 2.2).  
§§ 3.3 and 3.4 contain the modalities for determining the special supervisory board member from 
among all supervisory board members to be elected by the shareholders. In principle, the special 
supervisory board member is determined  by the supervisory board of Siemens Energy AG and is 
notified  to Siemens AG  by the 21st day prior to the relevant shareholders' meeting. If this has not 
been duly executed, the candidate from the supervisory board's election proposal who is not 
dependent on Siemens AG and who is the oldest in terms of age shall be deemed the special 
supervisory board member.  
 Share Transfer to Affiliated Companies (§  4) 
§ 4.1 clarifies that Siemens  AG and SBI  GmbH can still freely dispose of and transfer their shares 
in Sie mens Energy AG, both within the Future Siemens Group and to third parties.  
§ 4.2 imposes additional obligations for a transfer of shares in Siemens Energy AG within the 
Future Siemens Group. If, as a result of any such transfer, an affiliated company acqui res a direct 
participation of at least 10  % of the capital stock of Siemens Energy  AG, any such transfer is only 
permissible if that affiliated company accedes to the Deconsolidation  Agreement assuming the 
obligations incumbent upon Siemens  AG and SBI  GmbH . Separate acceptance by the other parties 
is not required for accession to the Deconsolidation  Agreement. As a matter of precaution, §  4.2 
further clarifies, that a mandatory accession of the SPT  e.V. to this Deconsolidation  Agreement 
shall in any case no t be required, even if it a cquires shares in the amount of 9.9  % in the capital 
stock of Siemens Energy AG in connection with the Spin -off. 
The provision in §  4.2 is supplemented by the provision in §  4.3. A transfer of shares to other 
affiliated companies  of Siemens  AG (Sections  15 et seqq.  AktG) is only permissible if, as a result 
of the transfer, the shares attributable to Siemens  AG (as defined in §  1.2) do not account for more 
than 15  % of the issued shares of Siemens Energy  AG. Affiliated companies of  Siemens  AG that 
hold shares in Siemens Energy  AG may, with the approval of Siemens  AG, accede to the 
Deconsolidation  Agreement at any time in accordance with §  4.2 sentence  2 of this Deconsolidation  
Agreement  at any time . Overall, the provisions in §§  4.2 and 4.3 are intended to ensure that Siemens 
AG could not control Siemens Energy AG via Shares only attributable to Siemens  AG (as defined 
in § 1.2).  
Under §  4.4. Siemens  AG undertakes to ensure that its affiliated compan ies including SBI  GmbH 
do not exercise their rights attached to the shares in Siemens Energy  AG to the extent that the non -
exercise of rights is required for Siemens  AG to fulfil its obligations towards Siemens Energy  AG 
under the Deconsolidation  Agreement .

 Shareholders ' Request for Compliance (§  5) 
Pursuant to §  5, shareholders of Siemens Energy  AG whose shares taken together represent a n 
amount in the capital stock of at least EUR  100,000 may request compliance with the obligations 
under the Deconsolidati on Agreement, and, if necessary, to enforce it in court. This ensures that 
Siemens AG in agreement with the managing board of  Siemens Energy AG  cannot  disregard the 
provisions of the Deconsolidation  Agreement and confirms that the parties have no such inte ntion 
either.  
 Applicability and Term (§  6) 
§ 6.1 contains the modalities for the term and ordinary termination of the Deconsolidation  
Agreement. The Deconsolidation  Agreement will take effect as of the Spin -off taking effect and is 
concluded for a term unt il the end of the fifth annual shareholders' meeting after such shareholders' 
meeting of Siemens Energy  AG following the Spin -off taking effect at which an election of 
shareholder representatives for Siemens Energy  AG's supervisory board was on the agenda.  Prior 
to the end of that term, no ordinary termination ( ordentliche Kündigung ) is possible. Thereafter, 
this Deconsolidation  Agreement will be renewed for the period leading up to the end of the fifth 
annual shareholders' meeting following thereafter, unl ess terminated by a party by giving at least 
three months ' notice prior to its expiry. The terms are selected in such manner that, in the event of 
a regular election of the shareholder representatives on the supervisory board, it is already certain 
that th e Deconsolidation  Agreement will still apply to the forthcoming re -election. This is intended 
to prevent supervisory board members from aligning themselves with the interests of Siemens AG 
already during their term of office due to concerns about their re -election and thereby endangering 
the effective de consolidation . 
§ 6.2 clarifies in compliance with binding law, that the right to terminate the Deconsolidation  
Agreement for good cause ( Kündigung aus wichtigem Grund ) remains unaffected. It also regulates 
a special case of termination of the Deconsolidation  Agreement for good cause: A sale of shares in 
Siemens Energy  AG by Siem ens AG or affiliated companies of Siemens  AG (including 
SBI GmbH) that results in Siemens  AG holding, directly or indirectly, taking into account the 
shares attributable to it pursuant to Section  16 (4) AktG, less than 15  % of the shares in Siemens 
Energy  AG shall constitute an extraord inary cause for terminating this Deconsolidation  Agreement; 
in this case, each Party may terminate this Deconsolidation  Agreement in writing at any time 
without notice ( fristlos kündigen ), as long as  the resepective  participation is not again above 15  % 
at the time of termination . 
§ 6.3 clarifies with regard to §  5, that only the Parties have a right to terminate or cancel this 
Deconsolidation  Agreement; the exercise of this right is not subject to the consent of the other 
shareholders of Siemens Energy  AG.

Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  255 
 Termination of the Deconsolidation  Agreement (§  7) 
The termination of this Deconsolidation  Agreement could result in Siemens  AG again gaining 
control or competitively significant influence as defined under merger control law over Siemens 
Energy  AG with th e consequence that clearance requirements under merger control law are 
triggered thereby. In this case, §  7 makes provision to ensure that any termination of the 
Deconsolidation  Agreement does not unintentionally lead to a cartel infringement. Termination of 
the Deconsolidation  Agreement shall only occur once the uncertainties under merger control law 
have been removed.  
 Miscellaneous (§  8) 
§ 8.1 regulates that the Deconsolidation  Agreement is governed by the laws of the Federal Republic 
of Germany, but excl uding its Private International Law  rules.  
§ 8.2 contains the standard clause on written form.  
§ 8.3 contains the standard provision for replacing any invalid or unenforc eable provisions of the 
Deconsolidation  Agreement (so -called severability clause).  
4. Group Separation Agreement (Annex  20 to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement)  
As described in Chapter  XIII.1.r) above, Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG have entered into a 
Group Separation Agreement simultaneously with the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement with the 
content as set out in Annex  20 to the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement. The Group Separation 
Agreement shall become effective upon the Spin -off taking effect . It essentially governs the legal 
relationships between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG for th e times from the effectiveness  
of the Spin -off and the associated separation of the Siemens Energy Business, including Siemens 
Energy AG, from the Siemens Group.  
The annex referred to herein is an annex to the Group Separation Agreement. Paragraphs without  
legal designation refer to paragraphs of the Group Separation Agreement. The main provisions of 
the Group Separation Agreement are explained below.  
 Establishment  of the Siemens Energy Business (§  1) 
On the basis of the establishment agreements , the Siemen s Energy Business has been or will be 
legally and organizationally bundled under the umbrella of Siemens Energy KG. Establishment 
agreements include all agreements concluded in respect of the legal and organizational bundling of 
the Siemens Energy Business  under the umbrella of Siemens Energy KG, in particular the Master 
Separation Agreement as well as the contribution agreements, LATAs and LSTAs as described in 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  256 more detail in Chapters V.1.b), V.1.c) and V.1.d) (" Establishment Agreements "). It is the 
common  understanding of the parties that the allocation of companies, activities, assets, liabilities 
and risks to the Siemens Energy Business made under and in connection  with the Establishment 
Agreements is conclusive and binding. This does not prejudice other  provisions set forth in the 
Establishment Agreements.  
§ 1.1 sets out the principle that the Establishment Agreements regulate the allocation of companies, 
activities, assets, liabilities and risks to the Siemens Energy Business  in a conclusive and binding  
manner . According to §  1.2, each p arty will procure that each of its group companies that is party 
to an Establishment Agreement shall perform such Establishment Agreement in accordance with 
the respective agreements made therein, unless otherwise provide d for in th e Group Separation 
Agreement. §  1.3 regulates the relationship between the Group Separation Agreement and the 
Establishment Agreements. The provisions of the Group Se paration Agreement come alongside to 
the provisions of the Establishment Agreem ents. The provisions set forth in the  Group Separation 
Agreement do not modify the provisions set forth in the individual Establishment Agreements. In 
the event that a provision agreed in the Group Separation Agreement substantially conflicts with 
an agree ment made in an Establishment Agreement, the agreement made in the Establishment 
Agreement shall take precedence (principle of precedence), unless a precedence of the provisions 
of the Group Separation Agreement is expressly agreed in the Group Separation Agreement 
(deviation from the principle of precedence). This conce rns certain tax provisions in §  5 and §  6, 
the confidentiality obligations in §  7 and the cooperat ion provisions in §  8. In such a case, each 
party shall ensure that its respective group com pany , which is a party to the respective 
Establishment Agreement , shall observe and appropriately implement this.  
§ 1.4 excludes from the scope of application of the Group Separation Agreement with regard to 
Future Siemens Energy Group Companies  certain ac tivities carried out based on agency agreements 
by the Future Siemens Group Companies (i) Siemens Spa (Algeria), (ii) Siemens A.E., 
Electrotechnical Projects and Products (Greece), (iii) Siemens Ltd., India, (iv) P.T. Siemens 
Indonesia (Indonesia) as well as (v) Siemens Pakistan Engineering Co. Ltd. (Pakistan).  
 Liability (§  2) 
§ 2 provides for mutual indemnity obligations of Siemens Energy AG and Siemens AG for 
liabilities incurred prior to the effectiveness  of the Spin -off. To the extent that claims are a sserted 
against Future Siemens Group Companies on the basis of statutory liability or non -contractual 
liability imposed under common law for liabilities, obligations or contingent liabilities established 
prior to the effectiveness  of the Spin -off, which , based on their origin or purpose, are attributable 
to the Siemens Energy Business, Siemens Energy AG must  indemnify Siemens AG or the 
concerned Future Siemens Group Companies from the respective liability. This provision applies 
mutatis mutandis  to the F uture Siemens Energy Group Companies. The provisions serve to prevent 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  257 the contractually agreed allocation from being undermined by liability provisions prescribed by 
statute or common law.  
 Admission to Stock Exchange Trading, Insurance, Allocation of Prosp ectus Liability 
(§ 3) 
§ 3.1 governs the admission of all Siemens Energy Shares to trading on the Regulated Market of 
the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and additionally in the sub -segment of the Regulated Market with 
further post -admission obligations (Prime Sta ndard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange immediately 
after effectiveness  of the Spin -off, as provided for in the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement. For the 
purposes of admission to stock exchange trading, Siemens Energy AG prepare and publish (or 
otherwise mak e available to investors in the context of the admission to stock exchange trading) a 
securities prospectus to be approved by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority 
(Bundesanstalt für Finanzdiensleistungsaufsicht) and further marketing material s and other 
documents. . The parties shall take out market -standard insurance for the risks typically associated 
with an admission to stock exchange trading.  
Pursuant to §  3.2, in the event of prospectus liability towards investors, damages in connection wi th 
the implementation of the admission to stock exchange trading shall be divided between Siemens 
AG and Siemens Energy AG at a ratio of 45  % and 55  %, respectively, provided that no insurance 
pursuant to §  3.1 has been taken out or if, despite such insura nce cover, in fact compensation for 
the damage cannot be obtained. This applies in particular to (i) the liability under warranty and 
indemnity obligations of Siemens Energy AG vis-à-vis the banks accompanying the transaction and 
(ii) costs and expenses (i ncluding charges) incurred by a party in the context of defending or 
asserting (counter -)claims in connection with prospectus liability, if and to the extent that these 
costs and expenses are necessary or adequate from the perspective of a prudent and cons cientious 
manager. §  3.2 contains a mutual indemnification of the parties at the ratio described above. All 
contributory negligence provisions (including Section  254 BGB), principles and objections are 
expressly excluded between the parties.  
 Accounting (§  4) 
In its consolidated financial statement , Siemens AG will, as from the effectiveness  of the Spin -off, 
recognize its participations in Siemens Energy AG as investments accounted for using the equity 
method (IAS  28), cf. §  4.1. In order to fulfil the corre sponding disclosure obligations, in particular 
pursuant to IFRS  12, and for the purpose of deconsolidating the Siemens Energy Business and the 
first-time application of the equity method, Siemens Energy AG undertakes to provide Siemens 
AG with all document s and information required or deemed appropriate by Siemens AG. The above 
shall also apply, upon request by Siemens AG, outside of the regular reporting of Siemens Energy 
AG, in particular for the purpose of timely responses to potential questions asked by  the German 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  258 Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel ( Deutsche Prüfstelle für Rechnungslegung ) regarding 
Siemens AG's participation in Siemens Energy AG (with the provisions in §  8.5 applying mutatis 
mutandis  in this regard).  
Conversely, §  4.7 provides for an  obligation of Siemens AG to provide information that Siemens 
Energy AG reasonably requires to fulfil disclosure obligations in connection with the shareholder 
status of Siemens AG.  
For the purposes of consistency, pursuant to §  4.2 the regular quarterly r eporting of Siemens Energy 
AG to Siemens AG shall be conducted in accordance with currently applied accounting and 
valuation principles and other accounting principles of Siemens AG, which shall be made available 
by Siemens AG. In addition , the parties agr ee to establish a procedure for the exchange of 
information regarding regulatory changes to the applicable accounting standards and potential 
changes of accounting principles.  
The scope and time limits of regular reporting are set out in Annex  4.4 to the G roup Separation 
Agreement . § 4.4 provides for a coordination obligation of both parties with regard to all 
circumstances relevant to reporting. Annex  4.4 shall be amended or supplemented by the 
contractual parties as appropriate.  
§ 4.3 provides for an obli gation of Siemens Energy AG to make available to Siemens AG all 
information that is reasonably required for reporting of expected earnings per share or substantial  
deviation therefrom in the context of Siemens AG's own financial reporting. Siemens AG shall  
publish information that at least indirectly allow conclusions as to the earnings situation of Siemens 
Energy AG either only after the publication of the relevant financial reports of Siemens Energy AG 
or following prior consultation with Siemens Energy A G. 
§ 4.6 governs a reimbursement obligation of Siemens AG for additional reasonable external costs  
incurred by Siemens Energy AG in connection with the fulfilment of the obligations specified in 
§ 4 as agreed between the parties and contingent on written p roof thereof.  
As provided for in §  4.8, the overall obligations of the parties under §  4 are subject to the condition 
that the disclosure  of the relevant information is legally permissible, in particular considering 
capital market and insider trading legal  provisions. These obligations shall apply pursuant to §  4.9 
only as long as Siemens AG holds a direct or indirect total participation of at least 20  % in the 
capital stock of Siemens Energy AG (without taking into account the participation of SPT e.V. in 
Siemens Energy AG). Only in this case a significant influence of Siemens AG within the meaning 
of IAS  28 can be assumed. If the 20  % threshold is not  / no longer reached, the parties undertake to 
come to an adequate and expedient agreement on forwarding th e relevant information.

 Tax Indemnifications (§  5) 
§ 5.1 sets forth a definition of "Taxes".  
§ 5.2 contains a list of the contributions of business assets within the meaning of Section  24 (1) 
UmwStG to Siemens Energy KG in the course of the bundling of the  Siemens Energy Business 
under Siemens Energy KG:  
 effective as of 1  January 2020, Siemens AG contributed a business unit (Teilbetrieb ) in 
exchange for the  increase of its partnership interest  (thereafter, the partnership interest was 
contributed to SBI Gmb H by Siemens AG, cf. also Chapter V.1.d)) ; 
 Siemens AG and Kyros 63 GmbH joined SBI GmbH  as new partners , which is treated 
under tax law as a  new foundation (Neugründung ) of the enlarged Siemens Energy KG, 
into which the former shareholders contribute their  shares; and  
 effective as of 31  March 2020, SBI GmbH contributed the 100  % corporate participations 
in Power Control GmbH, Trench Germany GmbH and Dresser -Rand do Brasil, Ltda. as 
business units in exchange for the  increase of its partnership interest . 
Siemens Energy AG undertakes to procure that Siemens Energy KG recognize s the business assets 
contributed in each case pursuant to Section  24 (2) sentence  2 UmwStG for tax purposes at their 
book values and will submit the book value application necessary for this purpose in each case in 
due time . In case of a violation of this obligation, Siemens Energy AG has a payment obligation 
towards Siemens AG or SBI GmbH, at the option of Siemens AG, to compensate Siemens AG or 
SBI GmbH for the taxes imposed on them and  for the reduction of corporate tax and trade tax loss 
carryforwards or, more specifically , deficits resulting from Siemens Energy AG's breach of 
obligation.  
In the course of the bundling of the Siemens Energy Business, SBI GmbH contributed partnership 
interests  in Siemens Energy KG into Siemens Energy AG in exchange for the granting of shares in 
Siemens Energy AG. Siemens Energy AG undertakes to recognize the business assets received for 
tax purposes at their book values and to submit the book value appli cation necessary for this 
purpose in due time. In case of a violation of this obligation, pursuant to §  5.3 Siemens Energy AG 
has a payment obligation towards Siemens AG or SBI GmbH, at the option of Siemens AG, to 
compensate Siemens AG or SBI GmbH for the  taxes imposed on them and for the reduction of 
corporate tax loss carryforwards resulting from Siemens Energy AG's breach of obligation.  
§ 5.4 provides for a list of shares subject to a blocking period ( sperrfrist behaft ete Anteile ) of 
Siemens AG and SBI GmbH in the connection with the bundling that have been or will be created 
due to the tax -neutral contribution of shares in Siemens Energy KG at book values according to 
Section  20 (2) sentence  2 UmwStG:  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  260  those shares granted to Siem ens AG (as transferring entity) in SBI GmbH (as receiving 
entity) for contributing partnership interests  in Siemens Energy KG;  
 those shares granted to SBI GmbH (as transferring entity) in Siemens Energy AG (as 
receiving entity) for contributing partnership  interests  in Siemens Energy KG.  
If Siemens AG, SBI GmbH or Siemens Energy KG were to be taxed for any contribution gain I 
(Einbringungsgewinn I ) in respect of  the Shares Subject to a blocking period pursuant to Section 
22 (1) UmwStG, (including as a conse quence of the occurrence of any alternative realization event 
(Ersatzrealisationstatbestand ) within the meaning of Section 22 (1) sentence 6 nos. 1 to 6 
UmwStG),  pursuant to §  5.5 the following applies:  
 To the extent that contribution gain I has been cause d by Siemens AG or SBI GmbH (for 
example by selling the shares subject to a blocking period), Siemens AG will pay to 
Siemens Energy AG an amount as compensation for the sum of the trade tax imposed on 
Siemens Energy KG or reduced trade tax deficit at Sieme ns Energy KG (insofar as their 
use has not been excluded by the transfer of the partnership interests in Siemens Energy 
KG from Siemens AG and SBI GmbH to Siemens Energy AG) resulting from the violation 
of the blocking period. The indemnification claim of Siemens Energy AG is reduced by a 
potential tax benefit that may apply to Siemens Energy AG and  / or Siemens Energy KG 
under the step -up approach pursuant to Section  23 (2) UmwStG (" Step-up Benefit "). The 
Step-up Benefit is to be calculated and deducted at  a flat rate not taking into account the 
facts and the actual tax situation of these two companies. To the extent that the Step-up 
Benefit exceeds the amount, which Siemens  AG would have to pay to Siemens  Energy AG 
without the deduction of the Step-up Benefit, Siemens  Energy AG is obliged to pay to 
Siemens  AG an amount equal to this difference. With regard to the exceeding amount, the 
calculation of the present value of the Step-up Benefit to be deducted and the amount to be 
paid by Siemens AG without th is Step-up Benefit assumes that Siemens  AG or SBI  GmbH 
have first disposed of such shares that include no or lower taxable hidden reserves as far as 
they can freely dispose of such shares; this does not apply if all shares are sold to a third 
party outside  the group or for good cause to an affiliated company in a single economic 
transaction. If shares are sold at a later stage within the relevant blocking period which 
have lower hidden reserves compared to the shares which have been sold previously, to 
determine the calculation of the exceeding amount, it is assumed for the calculation of the 
present value of the step -up benefit to be deducted and the amount to be paid by Siemens 
AG without this step -up benefit, that the shares with the higher hidden reserve s actually 
sold previously were only sold at this later point in time and that Siemens Energy AG will 
pay to Siemens AG the exceeding amount determined accordingly.  
 To the extent that contribution gain I is caused by Siemens Energy AG or Siemens Energy 
KG, Siemens Energy AG will pay to Siemens AG an amount equal to the sum of the 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  261 resulting corporate tax imposed on Siemens AG and on SBI GmbH (including solidarity 
surcharge)  or the nominal amount of the resulting reduction of corporate tax loss 
carryforwards at Siemens AG and SBI GmbH.  
 For the purposes of § 5.5. , the contribution gain I shall be deemed caused if it is triggered 
by the conduct of the relevant company or by an event within the sphere of risk of that 
company. No relevant conduct is deemed to exis t for this purpose if shareholder rights of 
Siemens AG or of SBI GmbH in their respective role as shareholder in Siemens Energy 
AG (e.g. voting rights at the shareholders' meeting or on the supervisory board) are or are 
not exercised.  
 To the extent that Si emens  Energy  AG is obliged to payment pursuant to §  5.5, the amount 
is payable in two installments, namely 50  % at once and 50  % 24 months after the due date 
of the first installment; in case of §  5.5b), the second installment shall bear interest at 2  % 
p.a. 
§ 5.6 defines the obligation of the parties to compensate the other party for tax losses in the form 
of taxes, the reduction of corporation tax loss carryforwards or of trade tax deficits which have 
arisen as a result of an action with retrospective ef fect under tax law taken by the party or its group 
company after effectiveness  of the Spin -off with respect to the other party or its group companies.  
§ 5.7 sets forth the legal consequences of a breach of the duty to cooperate in tax matters (§  6). 
Accordi ngly, the party who violates the duty to cooperate must compensate for the resulting losses 
under tax law.  
Pursuant to §  5.8, the party that, according to the preceding paragraphs of §  5, is obligated to make 
a payment must pay additionally an amount  to th e other party or that party's group company 
concerned,  that is necessary to place the other party or that party's group company such that in case 
of an after -tax assessment, it will receive in total the amount it would have retained without taxation 
of its  claim and  / or the payment made ( gross -up). If and to the extent that the reduction of corporate 
income tax loss carryforwards and  / or trade tax deficits  is to be reimbursed on the merits in 
accordance with §  5, as per §  5.9 the actual taxes that are subsequently payable because these loss 
carryforwards and  / or tax losses are not available will not have to be reimbursed additionally.  
§ 5.10 contains provisions on the due date of claims under §  5, while §  5.11 contains provisions on 
the statute of limi tations (six months after the underlying tax assessment has become final, but no 
earlier than after expiry of six months after effectiveness  of the Spin -off, and no later than eight 
years after effectiveness  of the Spin -off). Finally, §  5.12 establishes th e calculation principle of the 
prohibition of economic over - or undercompensation. According to this principle, claims under §  5 
must be calculated in such a way that the same facts are not taken into account more than once.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  262 
 Cooperation in Tax Matters (§  6) 
§ 6 of the Group Separation Agreement provides for a cooperation clause in tax matters. §  6.1 
generally provides for the obligation of both parties to cooperate with the purpose of reducing to 
the greatest extent possible the tax burden for both parties and, in particular, to provide each other 
with the essential records necessary to reach this purpose.  
Furthermore, according to §  6.2, Siemens Energy AG undertakes to provide the Future Siemens 
Group Companies, to the extent they are affected by a tax proc eeding relating to the Siemens 
Energy Business, with all pertinent information that enables the Future Siemens Group Companies 
to comply with their obligations under applicable tax law. The same applies accordingly for 
Siemens  AG if the opposite is the cas e. Pursuant to §  6.3, §  6.2 also applies accordingly to 
agreements that are part of the Siemens Energy Business but legally remain at one of the Future 
Siemens Group Companies. Continuing cooperation rights of Siemens AG on other legal grounds 
remain unaff ected hereby.  
§ 6.4 specifies the principle of the independent conduct of tax proceedings, notwithstanding §  6.2. 
At the same time, however, the obligation to cooperate is established for tax proceedings that 
formally concern one party but also affect the  other party, e.g. as a result of the contingent liabilities 
or a previously existing tax group status . Accordingly, the party who is formally conducting the tax 
proceedings shall ensure that mutual agreement with the other party on the course of action is  
sought . If the parties do not reach any agreement, the party who itself would owe more than 50  % 
of the relevant tax or would receive more than 50  % of the relevant tax refund decides.  If the 
relevant tax or tax refund is attributed in equal parts to both  parties, the party who is formally 
conducting the tax proceedings decides.  
In addition, pursuant to §  6.5, the parties shall ensure that the tax group status between any Future 
Siemens Energy Group Company  and any Future Siemens Group Company  that exists or existed 
in periods before the effectiveness  of the Spin -off remains effective for those periods  and, in the 
event of any objections by the tax authorities,  take any measures to remedy such objections . If these 
measures result in a shift of assets  between any Future Siemens Energy Group Company  and any 
Future Siemens Group Company , the parties will provide financial reimbursement therefor . 
If and to the extent internal or external advisory costs arise for the parties and  / or their group 
companies in connection with the fulfillment of the obligations set forth in §§  5 and  6, § 6.6 
stipulates that these costs are borne by each of the parties themselves respectively ; the provisions 
contained in any of the Establishment Agreements remain unaffected. According to  § 6.7, the party 
that has initiated a suspension of payment, a deferral or other similar postponement of the due date 
shall bear any interest in connection with such postponement and is responsible for any security to 
be provided. § 6.8 extends the requirements of §§  5 and 6 to the respective legal successors of the 
companies.  
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  263 § 6.9 closes with the obligation of Siemens Energy AG upon request of and in consultation with 
Siemens AG to appoint an internationally recognized tax advisory firm, to fu lfill the obligations of 
Siemens Energy AG provided for in §  6 for and on behalf of Siemens Energy AG.  
 Confidentiality (§  7)  
§ 7 contains standard confidentiality provisions with regard to information arising from the joint 
group affiliation of the businesses or from rights to information under the Group Separation 
Agreement or the Spin -off and Transfer Agreement. Furthermore, it is specified that the provisions 
of § 7 take precedence over possibly contradictory provisions in the Establishment Agreem ents. 
 Information Sharing, Rights to Documents and Cooperation Duties (§  8) 
§ 8 regulates the future information sharing between the parties. §  8.1 specifies the legitimate 
interests for the disclosure of information as well as its procedure.  
Pursuant to § 8.2, Siemens Energy AG and its group companies are entitled to receive all business 
records related to the Siemens Energy Business . At the same time , the Future Siemens Group 
Compan ies will be authorized to inspect these business records to the extent th at these records relate 
to the time of joint affiliation in the Siemens Group until the Spin -off taking effect . § 8.3 stipulates 
that all business records not covered by §  8.2 remain with Siemens AG and its group companies. 
The Future Siemens Energy Group Compan ies will be authorized to inspect these business records 
to the extent that there is a legitimate interest in such inspection. §  8.4 relates to the right to destroy 
business records  after the statutory retention periods expire.   
Pursuant to §  8.5, the parties shall be obliged to assist each other in compliance issues, 
administrative proceedings and legal disputes that relate to the fields of operation of the other party, 
whereby §  6 contains exhaustive provisions with regard to tax matters.  
In additi on, §  8.6 requires the parties to agree on appropriate provisions for the distribution of any 
costs arising under §  8. Finally, it is stated, that the provisions of §  8 take precedence over possibly 
contradictory provisions in the Establishment Agreements,  § 8.7. 
 Assertion and Fulfillment of Claims  (§ 9)  
Since the Group Separation Agreement also specifies entitlements and obligations of the parties at 
various points which affect group companies of the parties §  9.1 stipulates that the Group 
Separation Agre ement provides for the entitlements and obligations of the parties exclusively. In 
this respect, §  9.2 imposes an obligation on each party to ensure that its group companies comply 
with the provisions of the Group Separation Agreement. §  9.3 provides for a  non-assignment clause 
CONVENIENCE TRANSLATION – ONLY THE GERMAN VERSION IS AUTHORITATIVE  
Joint Spin -off Report of the managing boards of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and Siemens Energy AG  264 for claims  under the Group Separation Agreement with the exception of the assignments to group 
companies of the assigning party.  
 Dispute Resolution, Arbitration Clause (§  10) 
§ 10 governs the procedure to be followed in the event of disputes between the parties. In addition

Preamble
0.1 Siemens AG with its registered  offices  in Berlin  and Munich  is registered with the register 
of companies (Handelsregister) at the district court (Amtsgericht) of Charlottenburg under 
registration number HRB  12300  B and with the register of companies at the district court  
of Munich  under registration  number HRB 6684. The capital  stock of Siemens AG at the 
time of conclusion of this Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement amounts to 
EUR 2,550,000,000, divided into 850,000,000  shares of no par value (registered shares). 
Siemens AG holds 50,690,288 treasury shares  at the time of conclusion of this Spin-off 
and Transfer Agreement. Together with its current  direct and indirect  subsidiaries, Siemens 
AG forms a group of companies  (the "Siemens Group").
0.2 Siemens Energy AG with its registered  office in Munich  is registered with the register of 
companies at the district court  of Munich under registration number  HRB 252581. The 
capital stock of Siemens Energy AG at the time of conclusion of this Spin-off and Transfer 
Agreement amounts to EUR 100,000, divided  into 100,000 shares of no par value 
(registered shares).  At the time of conclusion of this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement, the 
sole shareholder  of Siemens  Energy  AG is Siemens AG.
0.3 Siemens AG has decided to legally separate the worldwide operations of Gas and Power  
of the Siemens  Group to be legally  separated and the shares held by the Siemens Group  in 
the amount of approximately  67 % in Siemens Gamesa Renewable  Energy, S.A. ("SGRE ") 
(together, the "Siemens Energy Business") under Siemens  Energy  AG, the shares of which  
are to be listed on the Frankfurt  Stock Exchange. Going  forward, Siemens Energy AG is 
to be managed as an entity that is legally  and organizationally  independent of Siemens AG. 
In that context, Siemens AG intends to retain a (direct and indirect) minority interest in the 
future listed Siemens Energy AG as its non-controlling  anchor  shareholder initially with a 
total share in its capital stock of 45 %, of which 9,9 % of the capital  stock shall be 
transferred to Siemens Pension-Trust e.V. in connection with the Spin-off. With the 
strategic and operational development of Siemens Energy AG, Siemens AG intends to 
reduce its stake  in the amount  of 35,1 % significantly in a timeframe of twelve to eighteen 
months after the spin-off  taking effect.  The remaining shares  in Siemens Energy AG are to 
be transferred to the shareholders of Siemens AG by way of a spin-off in accordance  with 
the German  Transformation Act (Umwandlungsgesetz). Immediately  after the spin-off 
takes effect, the shares  in Siemens  Energy AG are to be admitted to trading on the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange (the legal  separation of the Siemens Energy  Business under  Siemens 
Energy AG, the transfer of shares  to the shareholders of Siemens AG and the admission to 
stock exchange  trading,  altogether, are hereinafter referred to as the "Transaction").
50.4 In preparation  of the legal  separation,  the Siemens Energy Business has been and will be 
legally and organizationally consolidated  under  the umbrella  of Siemens Gas and Power 
GmbH & Co. KG with its registered office in Munich and registered with the register  of 
companies at the district court  of Munich under registration number  HRA 111200, to be 
renamed Siemens  Energy Global  GmbH & Co. KG ("Siemens Energy  KG"). The fixed 
capital (Festkapital) of Siemens Energy  KG amounts to EUR 174,908,333 at the time of 
conclusion of this Spin-off  and Transfer Agreement. A partnership interest 
(Kommanditanteil) representing a pro rata amount  of the fixed capital of EUR 153,892,732 
(approximately 87.98 % of the fixed capital) is held directly by Siemens AG. A partnership 
interest representing the remaining  pro rata amount  of the fixed  capital  of EUR 21,015,601 
(approximately 12.02 % of the fixed  capital) is held by Siemens Beteiligungen Inland 
GmbH with its registered office in Munich, registered  with the register of companies  at the 
district court  of Munich  under HRB 139644 ("SBI GmbH"), which  is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Siemens AG. The sole personally  liable  partner (general partner) of Siemens 
Energy KG, which holds no interest  in its fixed capital, is Siemens Gas and Power 
Management GmbH, a German limited liability company (GmbH), with its registered 
office in Munich, registered with the register of companies at the district court of Munich  
under HRB 241345 ("General Partner  GmbH").  At the time of conclusion  of this Spin-
off and Transfer  Agreement, the share  capital of General Partner GmbH amounts to 
EUR 25,000, divided into 25,000 shares, each with a nominal value of EUR 1.00. At the 
time of conclusion of this Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement,  approximately 87.98 % of this 
share capital (21,996 shares) is held by Siemens AG. The remaining approximately 12.02 
% of the share  capital (3,004 shares)  is held  by SBI GmbH.
0.5 The Transaction is to be  implemented  mainly by taking the following key steps:
0.5.1 Siemens AG will contribute  to Siemens Energy AG a partial partnership interest  
representing a pro rata amount  of the fixed  capital of Siemens Energy KG of 
EUR 57,693,148.85 (equivalent to approximately 32.98  % of the fixed capital) and its 
8,246 shares  in General  Partner GmbH bearing  the serial  numbers 13,751 through 21,996 
(equivalent to approximately  32.98 % of the share capital)  with economic effect as of the 
contribution effective date,  i.e. 1 April 2020, 0:00 hours (subject to a contractually agreed 
postponement of the contribution  effective date), in return for (i) the issuance of 
239,582,401 new shares  of no par value (registered shares) and (ii) a payment  by Siemens 
Energy AG to Siemens AG of a cash amount of EUR 175,746.41, plus any interest credited 
to bank accounts and group-internal settlement accounts  (Verrechnungskonten) of Siemens 
Energy AG between 1 April  2020 up to and including  day of the payment  or, as the case 
may be, less any interest  debited from such accounts during  this period.  In order to grant 
these shares to Siemens AG, Siemens Energy AG will increase its capital  stock  of 
6EUR 100,000 by EUR 239,582,401 to EUR 239,682,401  ("SAG  Capital Increase  in 
Kind").  
0.5.2 With economic effect as of 1 April 2020 (subject to a contractually agreed  postponement 
of the contribution effective date), SBI GmbH will contribute to Siemens Energy  AG the 
partnership interest held by it representing a pro rata amount  of the fixed capital  of Siemens 
Energy KG of EUR 21,015,601 (equivalent  to approximately 12.02 % of the fixed capital) 
and its 3,004 shares  in General Partner GmbH bearing  the serial numbers  21,997 through  
25,000 (equivalent to approximately  12.02 % of the share capital) in return for the issuance 
of 87,307,936 new shares of no par value  (registered  shares) in Siemens Energy AG. In 
order to grant  these  shares, Siemens Energy  AG, which  at this time is still a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Siemens AG, will increase  its capital  stock  by another  EUR 87,307,936 to 
EUR 326,990,337 ("SBI  Capital Increase in Kind "; the SBI Capital Increase  in Kind and 
the SAG Capital Increase in Kind together are hereinafter  referred to as the "Capital 
Increases in  Kind ").
0.5.3 The contributions in connection with the Capital Increases in Kind as set forth in nos. 0.5.1 
and 0.5.2 above  will be made in accordance with the contribution  agreement likewise 
notarized as of the date hereof and annexed to this Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement as 
Annex 0.5.3. The Capital Increases in Kind are to be carried  out prior to the spin-off taking 
effect. After the Capital Increases in Kind are carried  out, the only assets that Siemens 
Energy AG will hold will be a partnership interest in Siemens Energy KG representing a 
pro rata amount of its fixed  capital of EUR 78,708,749.85  (equivalent to 45 % of Siemens 
Energy KG's  fixed capital) and 11,250 shares in General Partner GmbH  (equivalent to 
45 % of General  Partner  GmbH's share  capital).  A partnership interest representing  the 
remaining 55 % of the fixed capital of Siemens  Energy KG and the remaining  55 % of the 
shares in General  Partner  GmbH will initially be held unchanged by Siemens AG.
0.5.4 Siemens AG's partial  partnership interest representing a pro rata amount of the fixed 
capital of Siemens Energy  KG of EUR 96,199,583.15 remaining  with Siemens  AG after 
the Capital Increases in Kind described  in nos. 0.5.1 through  0.5.3 (equivalent to 55 % of 
Siemens Energy  KG's fixed capital)  ("Spin-off Partnership Interest") and the shares in 
General Partner GmbH bearing the serial numbers 1 through 13,750 to still remain with 
Siemens AG (equivalent  to 55 % of the share capital)  ("Spin-off General Partner's  
Shares") are to be transferred to Siemens Energy AG in accordance with this Spin-off and 
Transfer Agreement  so that Siemens Energy AG will be the sole limited partner of Siemens 
Energy KG and the sole shareholder  of General Partner GmbH upon the spin-off taking 
effect (Siemens Energy  AG together  with its direct  and indirect subsidiaries  existing after 
the spin-off are hereinafter referred to as the "Future Siemens Energy Group"; the 
7Siemens Group without the companies of the Future Siemens Energy  Group  is referred  to 
as the "Future  Siemens Group"). 
0.5.5 As consideration for the spin-off, the shareholders of Siemens AG are to receive from  
Siemens Energy AG in proportion to their current shareholdings a total of 399,654,856 
shares of no par value  (registered  shares)  in Siemens Energy AG in accordance with this 
Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement. In order to carry  out the spin-off,  Siemens Energy  AG 
will increase  its capital stock from then EUR  326,990,337 by EUR 399,654,856 to 
EUR 726,645,193 (the "Spin-off Capital Increase").  The shares  to be granted to the 
shareholders of Siemens AG in order  to carry out the spin-off  will correspond to 55 % of 
the future capital stock of Siemens Energy  AG existing  after the Spin-off Capital  Increase 
and the Capital Increases in Kind (nos. 0.5.1 through 0.5.3 above). The remaining 45 % of 
the future capital stock of Siemens Energy AG will be held by Siemens AG and its wholly-
owned subsidiary SBI GmbH upon the spin-off taking  effect.
0.5.6 Immediately after the spin-off takes effect,  all shares in Siemens Energy AG are to be listed 
for trading in the Regulated Market  of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  and also in the sub-
segment of the Regulated Market  of the Frankfurt Stock exchange with additional post-
admission obligations (Prime Standard).
Now, therefore,  the Parties agree  as follows:
II.
Spin-off,  Spin-off  Effective Date, Spin-off  Statements of Financial  Position and Closing 
Statements  of Financial Position
§ 1
Spin-off
Siemens AG,  as the Transferring Entity, transfers by way of a spin-off  for absorption (Abspaltung 
zur Aufnahme) pursuant to Section 123 (2) no. 1 UmwG the portion of its assets specified in § 5.1 
of this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement  together  with all rights and duties (hereinafter, the "Spin-
off Assets ") in their entirety to Siemens Energy  AG as the Receiving Entity in exchange for the 
issuance of shares in Siemens  Energy AG to the shareholders of Siemens AG pursuant  to § 10 of 
this Spin-off  and Transfer Agreement (spin-off  for absorption preserving shareholding  
proportions). The items of the assets and liabilities  and other rights  and duties or legal  positions of 
Siemens AG  that are not to be allocated  to the Spin-off Assets under this Spin-off and Transfer 
Agreement or that are expressly  excluded from  the transfer under this Spin-off and Transfer 
Agreement will not be  transferred to Siemens Energy AG.
8§ 2
Spin-off Effective  Date  and Tax Transfer  Effective Date
2.1 The transfer of the Spin-off Assets will be effective as of 1 April  2020, 0:00 hours  in the 
relationship between Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG (the "Spin-off Effective  
Date").  Starting as of this point in time, the actions relating to the Spin-off Assets are 
deemed to have  been made for the account of Siemens Energy AG in the relationship 
between Siemens AG and Siemens  Energy  AG.
2.2 The tax transfer effective date for the spin-off is 31 March  2020, 24:00  hours (the "Tax

§ 3
Closing Statements of Financial Position and  Spin-off Statements of Financial Position
3.1 The closing  statements of financial position of the Transferring Entity under Sections 125 
sentence 1, 17 (2)  UmwG are the interim  statements of financial  position of Siemens AG 
as of 31 March  2020, 24:00  hours, prepared  in accordance with the provisions  on annual 
statements of financial  position and audits thereof, audited  by Ernst & Young GmbH  
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, which  was appointed  auditor of the closing 
statements of financial position by resolution of Siemens AG's shareholders' meeting of 
5 February 2020, issued with an unqualified  audit  certificate and approved by the 
supervisory board  of Siemens AG on 8 May 2020  (the "Closing  Statements of Financial 
Position").
3.2 The items of the assets and liabilities to be allocated to the Spin-off Assets are recognized 
in the spin-off statements of financial position as of 1 April  2020, 0:00 hours,  attached to 
this Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement  as Annex 3.2 (the "Spin-off Statements of 
Financial Position").  The Spin-off Statements of Financial  Position were derived from the 
Closing Statements of Financial Position  prepared as of 31 March 2020 (§ 3.1 of this Spin-
off and Transfer  Agreement), which  were  continued taking  into account  the contribution 
of a partial partnership interest  in the amount of EUR 57,693,148.85 in the fixed capital of 
Siemens Energy  KG and of the shares  in General Partner GmbH bearing the serial 
numbers 13,751 through 21,996  by Siemens AG into Siemens Energy AG as of 1 April 
2020, 0:00 hours, as described in no. 0.5 of  the Preamble. 
3.3 Siemens AG will reflect  the Spin-off Assets at book value in its Closing  Statements of 
Financial Position and at fair market value  in its tax Closing Statements  of Financial 
Position as of the Tax Transfer Effective  Date. Siemens  Energy  AG will reflect the Spin-
9off Assets  at book value in its commercial  statements of financial position.  Siemens Energy 
AG will include  the Spin-off Assets and in its tax statements of financial  position at the 
values contained  in the tax Closing  Statements of Financial Position  of Siemens AG as of 
the Tax Transfer Effective Date.
§ 4
Postponement of the Effective Dates
If the spin-off has not been registered  with the registers of companies  of the Transferring Entity at 
the district courts  of Charlottenburg  and Munich by the close of 31 October 2020, the Spin-off 
Effective Date is deemed  to be 1 October 2020, 0:00 hours, and the Tax Transfer  Effective  Date 
is deemed to be 30 September  2020, 24:00 hours, contrary to the above § 2 of this Spin-off and 
Transfer Agreement,  and the effective date of the Closing Statements of Financial  Position  of 
Siemens AG is deemed  to be 30 September 2020, 24:00 hours, contrary to the above § 3.1. In the 
event of any further delay of the registration  beyond  31 October of any subsequent year, the 
effective dates are  each postponed by one year in accordance with  the above  provision.
III.
Spin-off  Assets and  Modalities for the Transfer
§ 5
Spin-off  Assets
5.1 In the course of  the spin-off, Siemens  AG will transfer  to Siemens Energy AG
5.1.1 the Spin-off Partnership Interest along with all related rights  and duties, including the 
pertaining entitlement to all profits that have thus far not been withdrawn,  the balance on 
Siemens AG's  personal  account to be allocated  to the Spin-off Partnership Interest, and the 
pro rata amount in the jointly held reserve account (gesamthänderisch gebundenes 
Rücklagekonto) corresponding to the  pro rata  amount  of the fixed  capital; and  
5.1.2 the Spin-off  General Partner's Shares, including all related rights and duties, including the 
entitlement to  distribution of  all profits that have thus  far not been distributed.
5.2 Siemens Energy AG assumes the liability amount  of Siemens AG equivalent  to the pro 
rata amount of the fixed  capital represented  by the Spin-off Partnership Interest.
105.3 Existing  obligations  of Siemens  AG to make  contributions to Siemens Energy KG remain 
unaffected in its relationship  with Siemens Energy KG and will not be assumed by Siemens 
Energy AG in the  internal relationship either.
5.4 The Parties  will make  all declarations, issue all documents, and take all other  actions that 
may still be necessary  or appropriate in connection with the transfer  of the Spin-off Assets.
§ 6
Taking Effect, Closing  Date
6.1 The transfer  of the Spin-off Assets occurs with in rem effect (dinglich) upon the spin-off  
taking effect through its registration  with the registers of companies  of Siemens AG at the 
district courts of Charlottenburg  and Munich, with the later registration  being 
determinative (the  "Closing  Date "). 
6.2 Siemens AG undertakes to ensure  that no shareholder resolution  will be adopted on or 
before the Closing  Date  under  which the fixed  capital of Siemens Energy KG existing  at 
the time of conclusion  of this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement or the share capital  of 
General Partner GmbH is changed. Siemens AG also undertakes  to ensure that no 
withdrawals from  Siemens  Energy KG or distributions of profits  of General Partner GmbH  
are made on or before  the Closing Date. Siemens  AG will ensure  that the Spin-off Assets 
are managed  and disposed of only in the ordinary course  of business  and with the diligence 
of a prudent  businessman and in compliance with the requirements of this Spin-off and 
Transfer Agreement  during  the period  between  the conclusion  of this Spin-off and Transfer 
Agreement and the  Closing Date.  
§ 7
Catch-all  Provisions
7.1 If and to the extent that the Spin-off Assets do not already pass to Siemens Energy  AG by 
force of law upon  the registration  of the spin-off, Siemens AG will transfer  those  assets to 
Siemens Energy AG. In exchange, Siemens  Energy AG is obliged  to consent to the transfer.  
The Parties will treat each other in the internal relationship as if the transfer had also 
occurred in the  external relationship  as of the Spin-off  Effective Date.
7.2 In connection with a transfer under  § 7.1 of this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement, the 
Parties will initiate  all necessary or appropriate measures and legal acts and cooperate  in 
them in order  to transfer  the Spin-off Assets.
11§ 8
Protection for  Creditors  and Internal  Compensation
To the extent  no other allocation of burdens and liabilities under  or in connection with the Spin-
off Assets  results under  this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement, the following provisions apply:
8.1 If and to the extent that claims  are asserted against Siemens AG based  on the provisions in 
Section 133 UmwG or other  provisions on the protection of creditors for liabilities, 
obligations or contingent  liabilities that are being transferred to Siemens Energy AG in 
accordance with the provisions of this Spin-off  and Transfer  Agreement,  Siemens Energy 
AG must  indemnify Siemens AG from  the relevant  liability or obligation  on first demand.  
This also applies  in the event that such creditors assert  claims against Siemens AG for the 
provision of security.
8.2 If and to the extent that claims are asserted against Siemens Energy  AG on the basis of the 
provisions in Section 133 UmwG or other provisions by creditors  for Siemens AG’s  
liabilities, obligations or relationships  involving liability  that are not being transferred to 
Siemens Energy  AG in accordance with this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement, 
Siemens AG must indemnify  Siemens Energy AG against  the relevant liability or 
obligation on first demand. This also applies in the event  that such creditors  assert claims  
against Siemens Energy  AG for the  provision of security.
8.3 If and to the extent that the personal liability of Siemens AG is triggered for liabilities of 
Siemens Energy  KG because the liable contribution made by Siemens AG to Siemens 
Energy KG is deemed  to be paid back  to Siemens  AG, or one of the other  measures  
specified in Section 172  (4) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code 
(Handelsgesetzbuch, "HGB ") has been  taken, after the Closing  Date without the liable  
contribution having been  returned  in fact to Siemens AG or one of its affiliated companies, 
Siemens Energy  AG must indemnify Siemens  AG against  the relevant liability or 
obligation on first demand. This applies  in particular  in the event that the notice  of 
succession (Rechtsnachfolgevermerk) of Siemens  Energy AG is not registered,  or is not 
registered in time, with the  register  of companies.
§ 9
Warranties
9.1 Siemens AG warrants as of the Closing  Date  that it is the holder of the Spin-off  Partnership 
Interest and of the Spin-off  General Partner's Shares and that Siemens AG can freely 
dispose of the Spin-off Partnership Interest and the Spin-off General Partner's  Shares and 
12that they are not encumbered with rights of third  parties. Aside from this, no quality of the 
Spin-off Assets, especially specific features or a value of the business  of Siemens Energy 
KG, are agreed.
9.2 To the extent  legally permissible,  all rights and warranties relating to the quality of the 
Spin-off Assets that might exist in addition to those  in § 9.1 of this Spin-off and Transfer 
Agreement under  statutory  provisions or otherwise  are excluded.  The provision in this § 9.2 
of this Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement  applies  to all rights and warranties, regardless of 
the legal nature  (contractual or pre-contractual rights, rights under tort or other rights),  and 
especially also to those rights that could result in the cancelation or unwinding of this Spin-
off and Transfer  Agreement  or any  similar legal  effect.
IV.
Consideration and  Corporate Actions; Special Rights and  Benefits
§ 10
Issuance of Shares, Trustee and Capital Measures
10.1 As consideration for the transfer of the Spin-off  Assets to Siemens Energy AG, the 
shareholders of Siemens AG  will receive  one (1) share  of no par value (a registered share) 
in Siemens Energy AG for every  two (2) shares  of no par value  (registered shares) in 
Siemens AG at no charge  in accordance with their present participation (preserving the 
proportionate shareholdings). Altogether,  399,654,856  shares of no par value (registered 
shares) in Siemens Energy AG will be issued  to the shareholders of Siemens AG. In this 
context, it was taken  into consideration that, pursuant to Section 131 (1) no. 3 sentence 1 
UmwG, the shares held by Siemens AG as treasury shares are not entitled to allocation. 
Siemens AG will make  sure that the number  of the total issued shares in Siemens AG minus 
the treasury  shares which are not entitled  to allocation  under Section 131 (1) no. 3 sentence 
1 UmwG will be exactly 799,309,712 on the Closing Date.  The shares in Siemens Energy 
AG to be granted pursuant  to § 10.1 of this Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement are the new 
shares to be created by means  of the capital increase pursuant  to § 10.3 of this Spin-off  and 
Transfer Agreement.
10.2 The shares to be granted by Siemens Energy  AG are entitled  to participate in profits  for the 
fiscal years starting on 1 October 2019. If the Spin-off Effective Date  is postponed  pursuant  
to § 4 of this Spin-off  and Transfer Agreement to 1 October 2020, the date as of which the 
shares to be granted will be entitled  to participate in profits  will be postponed  accordingly 
to 1 October 2020. If the Spin-off  Effective  Date is postponed  further  pursuant  to § 4 of 
13this Spin-off  and Transfer Agreement,  the date as of which the shares  to be granted will be 
entitled to participate in profits will be postponed accordingly by one year.
10.3 In order to carry out the spin-off, Siemens Energy AG will increase its capital  stock by 
EUR 399,654,856 to EUR 726,645,193 by issuing  399,654,856 shares of no par value 
(registered shares)  in Siemens Energy AG. A pro rata amount of the capital stock of 
EUR 1.00 is  attributable to each new  share.  No additional premium (agio) is owed.
10.4 The contribution in kind will be rendered by means of the transfer  of the Spin-off Assets. 
To the extent  that the value  at which the contribution  in kind rendered by Siemens AG is 
recognized (for accounting purposes) by Siemens Energy AG, i.e. the book value under  
commercial law of the Spin-off Assets as of the Spin-off Effective  Date,  exceeds the 
amount of the increase  in the capital stock specified  in § 10.3 of this Spin-off and Transfer  
Agreement, this amount will be allocated to the capital reserve of Siemens Energy AG in 
accordance with Section 272 (2)  no. 1 HGB.
10.5 Siemens AG appoints  Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt am Main,  as the trustee for receiving 
the shares in Siemens Energy  AG to be  issued and  for disbursing them to the shareholders 
of Siemens  AG. Possession  of the shares to be issued will be granted to the trustee prior  to 
the registration  of the spin-off  and the trustee  will be instructed to provide the shareholders  
of Siemens  AG with the shares  after registration  of the spin-off with the registers  of 
companies of  Siemens AG.
§ 11
Granting of Special Rights
11.1 Siemens AG and its group companies  have made, or will make upon or before the spin-off 
taking effect, various  commitments  to provide shares  of no par value (registered shares)  in 
Siemens AG to members  of the managing board and employees of Siemens AG, as well as 
to members  of the corporate  bodies  and employees of Siemens Group,  including members 
of the corporate bodies and employees of the Future Siemens Energy Group  (together, for 
purposes of this § 11 of this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement,  the "Beneficiaries "), in the 
context of stock-based compensation programs  or, as the case may be, employee  
participation programs; these  commitments are listed in Annex 11.1 (together, the "Stock 
Entitlements").
11.2 The Stock Entitlements  existing as of the Closing Date  will be adjusted or compensated for 
with effect as of  the Closing Date  as follows:
1411.2.1 The rights under Stock Entitlements granted to Beneficiaries  who continue to be employed 
in the Future Siemens Group after the spin-off takes effect or who are otherwise not 
covered by § 11.2.2 of this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement  will be adjusted according to 
the provisions as described in Annex 11.2.1.
11.2.2 Compensation will be provided  for the rights under Stock Entitlements  granted to 
Beneficiaries of the Future Siemens Energy  Group who leave the Siemens Group  upon the 
spin-off taking effect in accordance with the provisions  as described  in Annex 11.2.2, 
unless otherwise  described  in § 12.4 of this Spin-off and  Transfer Agreement .
11.2.3 To the extent that any Party bears joint and several liability under applicable law for the 
fulfillment of obligations of the other Party under Stock  Entitlements,  § 8 of this Spin-off 
and Transfer Agreement applies directly or, where applicable, accordingly.
11.3 As of the time this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement is executed, Siemens AG has issued 
neither convertible  bonds nor bonds with warrants. 
11.4 Aside from  this, no rights are granted  for individual shareholders or holders of special 
rights within the meaning of Section 126 (1)  no. 7 UmwG  and no measures in the sense of 
this provision  are intended for such persons  either.
§ 12
Granting of Special Benefits
12.1 The Parties  intend  to take out market-standard insurance for the risks typically associated 
with an admission to stock exchange  trading in connection  with the listing of the shares  of 
Siemens Energy  AG. The insurance coverage is also to cover the members of the managing 
boards and the supervisory boards of Siemens AG and of Siemens Energy AG. The Parties 
will agree on the personal  and factual scope of the insurance coverage, the amount of the 
coverage, the insurance premium and  the internal allocation thereof. 
12.2 After the spin-off takes effect,  the current  chairman of the managing  board of Siemens AG, 
Joe Kaeser, and the member of the managing board Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas shall assume 
positions in the supervisory  board  of Siemens Energy AG; namely, Joe Kaeser is to be 
proposed as chairman  of the supervisory  board of Siemens Energy AG and Prof. Dr. Ralf 
P. Thomas as chairman of the audit  committee.  Pursuant to the future articles of association  
of Siemens Energy  AG (pursuant  to § V.13.1 of this Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement and 
annex 13.1), the members of the supervisory board receive – in addition to any committee 
remuneration – a fixed  annual remuneration  of EUR 120,000  per member, which  increases 
15by EUR 120,000 for the chairman of the supervisory board. The chairman of the audit 
committee additionally receives EUR 120,000. In its meeting on 8 May 2020, the 
supervisory board of Siemens  AG decided that the remuneration of Joe Kaeser and of Prof. 
Dr. Ralf P. Thomas as supervisory board member  of Siemens Energy AG is not to be 
deducted from their remuneration as members  of the managing board  of Siemens  AG.
12.3 Prior to the spin-off, the members  of Siemens Energy AG's managing board were promised 
a spin-off incentive by General Partner  GmbH. Accordingly,  depending  on the target 
achievement, amounts ranging from 100 % to 200 % of a target  amount individually 
determined for each member of the managing board  can be paid. The target amount  is 
EUR 1,500,000 for Dr.-Ing.  Christian Bruch and EUR 750,000 each for Dr.-Ing. Jochen  
Eickholt, Maria  Ferraro  and Tim Oliver Holt. The target amount  will be paid out if certain 
target values for the effects  of the spin-off  or the market value are achieved upon the spin-
off taking effect  and within  the first 120 days after the spin-off taking effect, based  on the 
average volume-weighted price of the share of Siemens Energy AG. If these target values  
are not achieved,  no spin-off incentive will be granted. If the target values are exceeded, a 
maximum of up to 200 % of the target amount will be paid out. Values between 100 % and 
200 % are determined by linear interpolation. The members  of the managing board are 
obliged to reinvest  the net profits from the spin-off  incentive  in shares of Siemens Energy 
AG. It is intended  that the obligation to pay managing board remuneration, including the 
spin-off incentive, will be transferred to Siemens Energy AG after the spin-off takes effect. 
12.4 General Partner GmbH has promised to the members of the management of the General 
Partner GmbH due to their activities  as members of the managing board of Siemens 
Energy AG commitments to receive  shares without own additional payment after a vesting 
period (stock awards) in addition  to their other remuneration. Thereby, a part of the 
remuneration shall be structured for the long term in that the achievement of financial and 
non-financial targets  over a four-year period  is measured (for details regarding  stock-based  
compensation and employee participation option plans for other members of executive 
bodies and employees  of the Future Siemens  Energy Group,  see § 16.6 of this Spin-off and 
Transfer Agreement below).  A specific target  amount  is set for each member of the 
managing board.  This target amount is EUR 1,920,000 for Dr.-Ing. Christian  Bruch and 
EUR 960,000 for Dr.-Ing.  Jochen Eickholt,  Maria Ferraro and Tim Oliver Holt,  
respectively. This target  amount is multiplied in each case by a provisional  maximum  target  
achievement rate of 200 %.  For this amount,  each member of the managing board is yearly, 
for the first time in the fiscal year 2021, granted forfeitable stock awards, the specific 
number of which is calculated on the basis of the share price on the grant date, less 
discounted estimated dividends during  the vesting  period. After  a vesting period of four 
years, each managing board  member  will be granted one share in Siemens Energy AG for 
16each stock award, whereby  the number of stock  awards finally granted  depends  on the 
actual achievement of the following  targets  during the assessment period:  total shareholder 
return of the share  in Siemens Energy  AG compared to competitors, i.e. change in the stock 
exchange price of the shares in Siemens Energy  AG plus dividends paid in comparison to 
the change in value of comparative indices  (40 %), earnings per share measured against 
previously set targets (40 %) and achievement  of sustainability targets according to a 
specific Environmental, Social & Governance  criteria (20 %). The degree of target 
achievement of the individual components may range from 0 % to 200 %.  The overall 
target achievement corresponds to the weighted  average target achievement  of the 
individual components. If the actual degree  of overall  target achievement is less than 200 % 
after the four-year  vesting period, a corresponding portion of the stock  awards lapses 
without replacement and a smaller number  of shares is allocated. The shares in Siemens 
Energy AG allocated at the end of the vesting period are limited to 250 % of the target 
amount. Any excess stock awards will lapse without replacement. If commitments to 
receive shares in Siemens AG without an additional payment after the expiration of a 
vesting period (stock  awards) have  been or will be made to the members of the managing 
board of Siemens Energy AG for the fiscal year in which  the spin-off takes effect, these 
commitments will expire without replacement upon the spin-off taking effect. If 
commitments to receive  shares in Siemens Energy AG without an additional payment after 
the expiration of a vesting period  (stock awards) have  been or will be made to the members 
of the managing board of Siemens Energy  AG for a fiscal year in which the spin-off will 
not yet take effect,  such commitments will expire  at the end of the respective fiscal year 
without replacement. Both the bonus and the stock awards  shall be subject to penalty  
(malus) and clawback provisions that allow  variable remuneration  which  can be reduced 
or reclaimed under  certain conditions, e.g. in the event of a determined  compliance 
violation. It is intended that the obligation to pay managing board  remuneration, including 
the commitment to grant stock awards,  will be transferred from the General Partner GmbH  
to Siemens Energy AG after the spin-off takes  effect.
12.5 For the members of the managing  board of Siemens AG, the stock-based compensation 
programs (as described in § 11 of this Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement) will be adjusted. 
The present spin-off may therefore impact these  programs, as they are based  on, inter alia, 
the development of the stock exchange  price of Siemens AG and the stock  exchange price  
of Siemens AG might develop differently as a  result  of the spin-off. 
12.6 Beyond that, no special benefits  within the meaning of Section  126 (1) no. 8 UmwG are 
being granted to members  of the managing boards and supervisory boards of the companies 
involved in the spin-off  or to an auditor  of the financial  statements or a spin-off auditor. 
The provisions of § 11 of this Spin-off  and Transfer  Agreement remain unaffected.

14.1 Siemens AG and Siemens  Energy AG will ensure that, to the extent legally  permissible, all 
declarations are made, all documents are issued and all other actions  are taken that are 
necessary or useful in order  to ensure  that the Capital Increases in Kind described  in no. 0.5 
of this Spin-off  and Transfer Agreement are implemented  before  the spin-off described in 
§ 1 of this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement is effected by means of its registration in the 
registers of companies of Siemens AG  at the district court of Munich and at the district 
court of Charlottenburg.
14.2 Siemens AG undertakes to ensure  that no further  capital  increases or any capital decreases

AG (including the existing shares, the shares  created in the course of the Capital  Increases  
in Kind and the shares created in the course of the Spin-off Capital Increase)  are admitted 
to trading on the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and also in the sub-
segment of the Regulated Market of the Frankfurt  Stock Exchange with additional post-
admission obligations (Prime Standard)  immediately  after the spin-off  taking  effect.
VI.
Consequences of the Spin-off for the Employees and their Representative Bodies
§ 16
Consequences of the Spin-off for the Employees'  Individual Rights
16.1 The employment relationships of the employees of Siemens AG will not be affected by the 
spin-off.
16.2 Siemens Energy AG is to date not acting operationally and is not employing any employees  
of its own. Therefore, the spin-off  has no consequences  for the employees of Siemens 
Energy AG.
16.3 The spin-off  also has – unless presented below – no consequences for the individual rights  
of the employees  of the Future Siemens Energy  Group, which  will be created, when the 
spin-off takes  effect  with Siemens Energy  AG as the new parent  company. The employees  
remain with their respective companies at which they are employed; their employment 
relationships will not be affected by the spin-off. This also applies to participation in the 
company pension plan and the pension commitments  made by the relevant companies with 
which the employees  are employed. 
1916.4 To the extent that employees participate in the stock-based compensation programs or, as 
the case may be, employee participation  programs existing  in the Siemens Group, the 
corresponding Stock Entitlements  will be adjusted  or compensation will be provided  for 
them as a consequence of the  spin-off as presented in  detail below. 
16.4.1 In the case of employees who will be employees of the Future  Siemens Group after the 
spin-off takes  effect,  the adjustment will be made – except for the Beneficiaries  under  the 
Siemens Group UK Share Incentive Plan ("UK  Plan ") – such that, upon the relevant Stock 
Entitlements falling due, each of these employees receives a cash payment  for the notional 
number of shares  in Siemens Energy  AG derived by taking  the number  of shares in Siemens 
AG due from the allotment  ratio of 2:1 as a basis, in addition  to the number  of shares in 
Siemens AG for which there is an entitlement on the due date (even  if cash compensation 
is provided for such an entitlement after discretionary  decisions or in accordance with the 
applicable rules). In the case of the Beneficiaries under  the UK Plan, an adjustment  going 
beyond the provisions  set forth in the UK Plan is not necessary because the Beneficiaries  –
 like all other  Siemens shareholders  as well – will receive shares in Siemens Energy AG 
for the shares  held by the trustee.  With regard  to further details  and special cases, reference 
is made to § 11 of this Spin-off and  Transfer  Agreement and  the corresponding annexes. 
16.4.2 Employees  of the Future Siemens Energy Group  who leave the Siemens Group  upon the 
spin-off taking effect  – except for the Beneficiaries  under the UK Plan – will receive cash 
compensation or a cash payment  for their entitlements  to shares in Siemens AG pursuant 
to the terms and conditions of the relevant stock-based compensation program  or, as the 
case may be, employee  participation program  after the spin-off takes effect. With regard to 
further details  and special cases,  reference  is made to § 11 of this Spin-off and Transfer 
Agreement and the corresponding annexes. Under the provisions of the trustee and 
custodial agreement entered into with the relevant custodian bank  commissioned by the 
Siemens Group, these employees are entitled  within a certain period of time after the end 
of the Closing Date  to sell or transfer to a private  account or a new securities account those  
shares in Siemens AG that they have acquired  for purposes of stock-based compensation 
programs or, as the case may be, employee  participation programs  and that are held in safe 
custody by the custodian bank  commissioned  by the relevant Siemens group company. If 
this is not done  within a reasonable time period, the shares in Siemens AG may be sold by 
the custodian bank for the account of the employee.  The Beneficiaries under the UK Plan 
will receive  no cash compensation;  instead, all of the shares held by the trustee  for the 
Beneficiaries – without any reduction on a pro rata temporis basis – are to be transferred 
to the Beneficiaries or sold for their  account.  
2016.5 To have  the members of the managing  board and other executives  and employees of the 
Future Siemens Energy  Group participate  in the long-term and sustainable success of the 
business, and to carry on the ownership culture  as lived  at Siemens Group,,  stock-based 
compensation programs and employee participation programs shall be implemented  in the 
Future Siemens Energy Group.
16.6 In particular,  the introduction of a share matching program, the granting  of stock  awards 
and commitments to grant jubilee  shares are planned and commitments  to a one-time spin-
off incentive have  been  granted or are planned.
Under the share matching program, members  of executive bodies and employees of the 
Future Siemens Energy Group, with the exception of members of the managing board  of 
the Siemens  Energy AG, may invest part of their income in shares in Siemens Energy  AG, 
whereby they will receive – to the extent  that they are employed  as of certain predetermined 
effective dates by Siemens Energy AG or any other  company of the Future  Siemens Energy  
Group with registered office in Germany participating in the programs  – in respect of an 
investment of EUR 100 for every  acquired  share in Siemens Energy AG, additionally two 
further shares (matching  shares) and, in the case of a further  investment  of EUR 160 for 
every acquired share  in Siemens Energy AG, additionally one further matching share;  the 
acquired and the additional matching shares  are not subject to any holding or vesting  
period. In respect of any investment beyond that and in respect of members of corporate  
bodies and employees who are employed on the relevant effective dates by companies of 
the Future  Siemens Energy Group with registered office abroad participating in the 
programs, they will receive additionally  one further  matching share  for every three shares 
in Siemens  Energy AG acquired; in this regard, both the acquired  and the additional  
matching shares are subject to a vesting period  of one year. 
Certain senior executives of Siemens Energy  AG – as well as the members of the managing 
board of Siemens Energy AG (see in this regard  § 12.4 of this Spin-off and Transfer 
Agreement above) – are to receive  a part of their remuneration as long-term stock-based 
compensation (stock awards) that will be subject  to a four-year  vesting period. After 
expiration of the vesting period, the senior  executives will receive for their stock awards 
shares in Siemens Energy AG, the number of which is to be determined based on the 
development of the company on the capital  market relative to competitors, the financial 
development of Siemens  Energy  AG and the performance  of Siemens Energy  AG 
regarding environmental,  social and governance criteria.
16.7 It is also planned to allocate stock awards as remuneration  components for the further 
members of senior management  and for other  selected members of executive  bodies  and 
21employees or to make special allocations  for special  achievements or projects that can be 
granted to all members of executive  bodies and employees of the Future Siemens Energy 
Group, with the exception of the members of Siemens Energy  AG's managing board, 
several times throughout a fiscal  year. These stock awards are fulfilled one quarter each 
after the first year, the second year, the third year and the fourth year,  respectively. 
Fulfillment does not depend on the achievement of certain targets. 
For members of executive bodies and employees who will be employed  by any company 
within the Siemens  Energy Group with its registered office in Germany,  a jubilee  share 
program is to be launched under  which  eligible  employees will receive  jubilee shares at 
certain service anniversaries. The service periods in the Siemens Group  will be taken into 
account for the  purposes  of this  program.
Subject to the successful and timely spin-off  and the initial stock  exchange listing,  certain 
members of executive bodies and employees  of the Future Siemens Energy Group who 
have materially contributed to the successful  spin-off received a one-time spin-off  
incentive, which – unlike  the spin-off incentive for the members  of the managing board of 
Siemens Energy AG – is structured as follows (as regards the organization  of the spin-off 
incentive for the members of the managing board of Siemens Energy AG, see § 12.3 of this 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement). The spin-off incentive consists of two elements; a short-
term cash component (bonus), which will be paid after the spin-off has taken  effect and 
which corresponds to 25 % of the target  amount,  and a long-term  stock-based component 
corresponding to 75 % of the target amount, which will be due after a vesting period of 
three years after the spin-off has taken  effect.  The target amount corresponds to a certain 
percentage of the basic remuneration  of the beneficiary. The long-term stock-based 
component depends – in the positive as well as in the negative – on the development of the 
share price of the share in Siemens  Energy AG in the first three years  after the initial listing  
and is in general fulfilled in form  of shares in Siemens Energy AG. If the share price 
doubles during this period, it can lead to a maximum total amount of 4.75 times the target 
amount from  the spin-off incentive. In general, the prerequisite is that the respective 
Beneficiary is employed by the Future  Siemens Energy Group at the time of performance.  
In relation to all Beneficiaries, this can presumably lead to a total inflow of a maximum  of 
approximately EUR 100 million.  
In addition, the Future Siemens Energy  Group plans to grant commitments to other  
members of corporate bodies and employees  of the Future Siemens Energy Group to 
receive shares as part of a one-time spin-off  incentive on the occasion of the listing. The 
target amount  for this spin-off incentive  equals  3 % of the gross annual  income  of the 
respective Beneficiary  with 100 % target achievement. The number of shares to be granted 
22is dependent on the development of the share  price of the Siemens Energy  share in the three 
years following the IPO. The maximum value of Siemens Energy shares granted is six 
times the target amount  if the share  price doubles. In general, the prerequisite  is that the 
respective Beneficiary is employed by the Future  Siemens Energy Group  at the time of 
performance. In relation to all Beneficiaries,  this can presumably lead to a total inflow of 
a maximum of approximately EUR 680 million.
16.8 In connection  with the preparation  of the Transaction, service agreements have  been 
entered into between companies  of the Future Siemens Group  and of the Future Siemens 
Energy Group under  which employees of the Future Siemens Group  will provide services 
after the spin-off takes  effect  for a certain, usually one-year, transitional period. Going 
forward, these  services will be performed by employees of the companies of the Future  
Siemens Energy  Group. It is therefore currently being considered that the relevant 
employees of the Future Siemens Group will be transferred to the Future  Siemens Energy  
Group by way of a transfer of business (Betriebsübergang) or on an individual  contractual 
basis. 
16.9 The spin-off will not result in personnel-related changes. However,  the business  operations, 
including, but not limited to, the organization, the portfolio and the positioning of the 
Future Siemens  Energy Group  will be monitored  on an ongoing  basis. In the event that 
adjustments are to be made  to German establishments  based on the relevant business  plan 
approved from time to time and on the further development of the business, the 
organizational and/or  personnel-related changes as well as the consequences for the 
employees will be coordinated with the competent co-determination bodies in good time 
and negotiations pursuant  to Sections 111 et seqq. BetrVG will be  started in  due course.
16.10 Apart  from the consequences described in § 16 and § 18 of this Spin-off and Transfer  
Agreement, no further  consequences for the employees'  individual rights  will arise  from 
the spin-off and  no further  measures are planned in this  respect either.
§ 17
Consequences of the Spin-off  for the Representative Bodies of the Employees  under  Works  
Constitution  Law ; Shop  Agreements  and Collective Bargaining  Agreements
17.1 Works  Councils,  Youth and Trainee Bodies  and Handicapped Representative Bodies
17.1.1 The establishments of Siemens AG and the further establishments of the Future  Siemens 
Group are not affected by the spin-off.  The existence, composition and terms of office of 
the existing works councils  and general works councils,  the existing  youth and trainee 
23representative bodies and the general  youth and trainee representative bodies as well as of 
the handicapped representative  bodies and the general handicapped representative bodies 
remain unaffected.
17.1.2 The group works council, the group handicapped representative body and the group youth  
and trainee representative body in the Siemens Group  will also continue  to exist after the 
spin-off takes effect. However, Siemens Energy AG and the other  companies  of the Future 
Siemens Energy  Group will leave the Siemens Group when  the spin-off takes effect, and 
Siemens Energy  AG will form  its own group together with its dependent  companies. This 
will lead to personnel changes  in the composition of the group works council  and the group 
youth and trainee representative body at Siemens AG. Accordingly,  those members of the 
group works council and the group youth and trainee representative  body who are 
employees of the Future Siemens  Energy Group will leave  those  bodies  when the spin-off 
takes effect. This currently concerns five members  of the group works council and 
five members  of the group youth and trainee representative  body. The vacant  positions  will 
be filled  with employees  of the Future Siemens Group  in accordance  with the applicable  
statutory provisions.
17.1.3 The European works council  in the Siemens Group (Siemens Europe  Committee) existing 
under the agreement in the version dated 24 March 2020 will also continue to exist after 
the spin-off takes  effect. As a result of the departure  of the establishments of the Future  
Siemens Energy  Group from the Siemens Group when the spin-off takes effect,  however, 
there will also be personnel  changes  in the composition of that body. Accordingly, those  
members of the Siemens Europe  Committee who are employees of the Future  Siemens  
Energy Group will leave  that body when the spin-off takes  effect.  This currently concerns 
seven members  of the Siemens Europe  Committee, who will be replaced by substitute 
members of the Future Siemens Group  in accordance with the agreement  in the version 
dated 24 March  2020. 
17.1.4 Since Siemens Energy AG is to date not acting  operationally and is not employing any 
employees of its own, it has neither a works  council  nor a youth  and trainee representative  
body nor a handicapped representative body.  The spin-off will not directly  change this 
situation. After  the spin-off takes effect, however, Siemens Energy  AG will be the parent 
company of the Future Siemens Energy  Group. Thus, the prerequisites for establishing a 
group works council  will basically exist at Siemens Energy AG pursuant  to 
Section 54 BetrVG. If such a group works council is established, the prerequisites for 
establishing a group handicapped  representative body exist pursuant to Section 180 (2) of 
the German Code of Social Law Ninth Book (Sozialgesetzbuch  Neuntes Buch). 
Furthermore, the prerequisites for establishing a group youth and trainee representative  
24body will in principle also exist after the spin-off takes  effect  in accordance with 
Section 73a BetrVG. 
17.1.5 In the event that a group works council  is established, group shop  agreements existing in 
the Siemens Group at the time of the spin-off  will continue to apply as group shop 
agreements of the Future Siemens Energy Group or otherwise as general  shop agreements 
or as shop agreements  in the companies of the Future Siemens Energy Group that are no 
longer part of  the Siemens Group after  the spin-off.
17.1.6 In addition,  the prerequisites for establishing a European works council will in principle 
also exist in the Future Siemens  Energy  Group after the spin-off takes effect.
17.1.7 The establishments  of the companies of the Future Siemens Energy Group are not affected 
by the spin-off.  The existence,  composition and terms of office of these existing  works 
councils and general works councils, youth and trainee representative bodies and general 
youth and trainee  representative bodies as well as handicapped representative bodies  and 
general handicapped  representative bodies remain  unaffected.
17.2 (General  and Group) Committees  of Spokespersons of  the Senior Executives
17.2.1 The existence, composition and terms of office of the committees of spokespersons and of 
the general committees  of spokespersons of the senior executives  at Siemens AG will not 
be affected by the spin-off.
17.2.2 The group committee of spokespersons in the Siemens Group will also continue to exist 
after the spin-off takes effect. However, Siemens  Energy AG and the other companies of 
the Future Siemens Energy Group will leave the Siemens  Group when the spin-off takes 
effect, and Siemens  Energy  AG will form the Future  Siemens Energy Group  together with 
its controlled companies. This will lead to personnel changes  in the composition of the 
group committee of spokespersons of Siemens AG. Accordingly, those members of the 
group committee of spokespersons who are employees of Siemens Energy AG or any of 
the other companies of the Future  Siemens Energy Group  will leave that body when the 
spin-off takes  effect.  This currently concerns  two members of the group committee of 
spokespersons. They  will be replaced  by employees  of the Future Siemens Group in 
accordance with the applicable  statutory provisions.
17.2.3 Since Siemens Energy AG currently  has no business  operations,  there is no committee of 
spokespersons of senior executives.  The spin-off will not directly change this situation 
either. However,  after the spin-off takes  effect, the prerequisites  for establishing a group 
25committee of spokespersons in the Future Siemens Energy Group will in principle exist 
pursuant to Section 21 of the German  Act on the Committees of Spokespersons of Senior  
Executives (Gesetz  über Sprecherausschüsse der leitenden  Angestellten – 
Sprecherausschussgesetz).
17.2.4 The committees  of spokespersons of the companies of the Future Siemens Energy Group  
will not be affected by the spin-off  in terms  of their  existence and composition.
17.3 Economic Committees
17.3.1 The economic  committees existing at Siemens AG and the other companies of the Siemens 
Group will continue to exist  without any change  even after the  spin-off.
17.3.2 Since Siemens Energy  AG currently is not acting operationally and is not employing any 
employees of its own, it has no economic committee. The spin-off will not change this 
situation either.
17.3.3 The economic committees currently existing in the companies of the Future  Siemens 
Energy Group will continue  to exist unchanged after the spin-off.
17.4 Collective Bargaining Agreements
17.4.1 The spin-off  will not affect  the applicability of collective bargaining agreements to 
companies of  the Siemens Group or of  the Future  Siemens Energy Group.
17.4.2 Siemens AG will continue to be a member  of the employers'  associations  of which it 
currently is  a member.
17.4.3 Siemens Energy KG is a member  of the following  employers' associations: Verband  der 
Bayerischen Metall-  und Elektro-Industrie  e.V., Südwestmetall Verband der Metall-  und 
Elektroindustrie Baden-Württemberg e.V.,  Verband der Metall- und Elektroindustrie in 
Berlin und Brandenburg e.V., Essener Unternehmensverband e. V., Unternehmerverband 
der Metallindustrie Ruhr-Niederrhein e.V., Hessenmetall - Verband der Metall-  und 
Elektro-Unternehmen Hessen e. V., VSME Verband der Sächsischen  Metall- und 
Elektroindustrie e.V.,  Nordmetall Verband der Metall- und Elektroindustrie e.V., VMET 
Verband der Metall-  und Elektroindustrie  in Thüringen e.V. Siemens Energy AG is 
currently not a member  of any employers' association  but currently  has no employees  
either.
2617.5 No Other Measures with Respect  to the Representative Bodies of the Employees 
under Shop Constitution Law
The spin-off has no further consequences  for the employees' rights  under works 
constitution law other than those  described in this § 17 of this Spin-off and Transfer  
Agreement and  no further  measures are planned in this respect either. 
§ 18
Consequences of the Spin-off for  
Corporate  Co-Determination/the Supervisory Board
18.1 Siemens AG has an equally  co-determined  supervisory board in accordance with the 
provisions of the MitbestG. The spin-off has no effect  on the existence and the size of the 
supervisory board  of Siemens AG as well as the terms of office of its members.  
Siemens AG will continue to be a company  with an equally co-determined supervisory 
board with twenty members  in accordance  with the provisions of the MitbestG (ten 
supervisory board members  representing the shareholders  and ten supervisory board 
members representing the employees). The employee  representatives on the supervisory 
board of Siemens AG are elected by the employees  of all companies/establishments of the 
Future Siemens Group located in Germany. Siemens  Energy  AG and the other  companies 
of the Future  Siemens  Energy  Group will no longer be group companies of Siemens AG 
after the spin-off takes  effect  so that employees of Siemens Energy  AG and the other 
domestic companies  of the Future Siemens Energy Group  will no longer be entitled  to elect 
members and to be elected as a member  of the supervisory board  of Siemens AG, and 
instead will be entitled to elect members and to be elected  as a member of the supervisory 
board of Siemens Energy  AG. Currently,  one employee  of the Future  Siemens Energy 
Group is a member  of the supervisory board  of Siemens  AG, who will no longer be eligible 
for election and will leave the supervisory board  of Siemens AG. The vacant  position will 
be filled  with an employee of the Future  Siemens Group  in accordance with the applicable  
statutory provisions. It is intended to have a successor appointed by a court for the period  
after the vacancy  begins until a successor  is elected.
18.2 Since Siemens  Energy AG does not have any employees to date, it currently has no 
supervisory board that is subject  to statutory employee co-determination. After  the spin-
off takes effect,  however,  Siemens Energy AG will establish an equally co-determined 
supervisory board  under  the provisions of the MitbestG  because it will be the controlling  
company of the Future Siemens  Energy Group and, accordingly, will have  more than 2,000 
employees in Germany  based  on the provision on attributing employees pursuant to 
Section 5 (1)  sentence  1 MitbestG. The managing board  of Siemens Energy  AG will 
27conduct so-called status proceedings pursuant  to Sections  97 et seqq. AktG after the spin-
off takes  effect. The Parties believe that, under  the provisions of the MitbestG,  normally  
more than 20,000 employees will be deemed to be employees of Siemens Energy AG after 
the spin-off takes effect and that, accordingly,  the supervisory  board  will consist  of twenty 
members pursuant  to Section 7 (1) sentence  1 no. 3 MitbestG,  of which ten members  will 
represent the shareholders and ten members  will represent the employees.
18.3 The ten supervisory board  members representing the shareholders  will be elected by the 
shareholders' meeting of Siemens Energy  AG prior to the spin-off taking  effect. They will 
be initially elected  for the period  beginning no later than the spin-off taking  effect until the 
registration with the register  of companies  of the amendment of the articles  of association 
in order to adjust the composition  of the supervisory  board so as to comply  with the 
provisions under  German  co-determination law after completion of the status  proceedings 
pursuant to Sections  97 et seqq.  AktG. Simultaneously, the same  supervisory board 
members representing the shareholders will be elected  subject to the condition precedent 
of registration of this amendment of the articles of association  with the register  of 
companies for a term of office  ending upon conclusion  of the next following shareholders' 
meeting. This serves the purpose  of facilitating a new election by the future shareholders 
of Siemens Energy  AG of the supervisory  board members representing the shareholders  to 
be elected by the shareholders' meeting. The supervisory board  members  representing  the 
employees will initially be appointed  by a court for a period after the registration with the 
register of companies of the amendment of the articles of association in order to adjust the 
composition of the supervisory board  so as to comply  with the provisions under  German 
co-determination law after completion  of the status  proceedings pursuant  to Sections 97 et 
seqq. AktG until the supervisory  board members representing the employees are elected by 
the employees. The spin-off  has no effects on the existence and composition of the 
supervisory boards of General  Partner GmbH, Siemens  Gamesa Renewable  Energy 
Management GmbH and Maschinenfabrik Reinhausen  GmbH. The supervisory  board  of 
General Partner  GmbH will continue to be composed of twenty supervisory board  
members, ten members  representing the shareholders  and ten members representing  the 
employees. The supervisory board of Siemens Gamesa  Renewable Energy 
Management GmbH will continue  to be composed of twelve supervisory board members, 
six members  representing the shareholders and six members  representing the employees. 
The supervisory board of Maschinenfabrik Reinhausen GmbH will continue to be 
composed of 12 supervisory  board members, six representing  the shareholders and six 
representing the employees.
28VII.
Additional Agreements
§ 19
Termination of the Controlling  Influence
Siemens AG, Siemens Energy AG and SBI GmbH have entered into the Deconsolidation 
Agreement attached hereto as Annex 19, which in particular provides for a restriction of 
the exercise  of the voting rights by Siemens AG and SBI GmbH  at the shareholders' 
meeting of Siemens Energy AG. The validity of the Deconsolidation Agreement is subject 
to the condition precedent of the spin-off  taking effect. As a consequence,  upon the spin-
off taking  effect,  Siemens AG will neither directly  nor indirectly exert any controlling  
influence within  the meaning of Section 17 AktG on Siemens  Energy AG. 
§ 20
Group  Separation Agreement
Siemens AG and Siemens  Energy AG hereby  enter into the Group Separation Agreement  
attached hereto as  Annex 20.
VIII.
Miscellaneous
§ 21
Costs and  Transaction Taxes
21.1 The Parties  assume that, as regards the entering into and implementation of this Spin-off 
and Transfer Agreement, no value  added  tax (Umsatzsteuer ) will arise because the transfer 
of the Spin-off Assets is either not subject  to tax or tax-exempt.  None of the Parties  will 
waive any tax exemption  of the services rendered  under this Spin-off and Transfer 
Agreement. If the tax authorities  take the view  that value  added tax arises in connection 
with any of these events,  the Parties undertake  to take all lawful  and reasonable measures  
to prevent such an assessment of value added tax and, if necessary,  the unappealability 
(Unanfechtbarkeit ) of such assessment. If value added tax is assessed  nevertheless against  
Siemens AG, Siemens Energy AG is not obligated to pay any additional amount  to Siemens 
AG as regards  the value added  tax; however, to the extent that Siemens Energy  AG has the 
right to deduct  input tax (Vorsteuerabzug) as regards the value  added  tax, Siemens Energy 
AG will pay to Siemens AG an amount equal to the input tax deduction, provided that 
Siemens Energy  AG may also fulfill this payment obligation  by effectively  assigning any 
29refund claim  against the tax office. Insofar  as value added  tax is nevertheless assessed 
against Siemens  Energy AG and Siemens Energy  AG is not entitled to deduct input tax 
with regard to value added tax, Siemens AG shall indemnify  Siemens Energy AG against 
value added tax  and any interest  thereon.
21.2 Siemens AG bears the costs that have arisen and will arise at the level of Siemens AG and 
Siemens Energy  AG in connection with the preparation, conclusion and implementation  of 
this Spin-off  and Transfer Agreement  on or before the Closing Date (including the costs of 
each shareholders' meeting and the costs of the filings for registration and of the 
registrations with the registers of companies, of the joint spin-off report,  of the spin-off 
audit and of the audits in connection with the Capital Increases in Kind and the post-
formation acquisition and of the planned admission to stock  exchange  trading and the 
respective costs for advisors, banks and insurers assigned  by Siemens Energy AG) and any 
transaction taxes  (Verkehrsteuer ) (with the exception of value added tax, which is provided  
for specifically  in § 21.1 of  this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement). 
§ 22
Final Provisions
22.1 This Spin-off and Transfer Agreement is subject to the condition precedent of approval of 
the shareholders'  meetings  of the Parties.
22.2 Siemens AG's managing board will ensure that the spin-off does not take effect  until after 
implementation of the Capital  Increases in Kind has been registered with the register of 
companies.
22.3 In the event that the spin-off has not taken  effect by the end of 31 March 2021 pursuant  to 
§ 6.1 of this Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement, each of the Parties  may withdraw from this 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement  by written  declaration  to the other Party.  
22.4 Siemens AG will grant Siemens Energy AG access  to all business  records related or 
allocable to the items of  the Spin-off Assets. 
22.5 Any disputes arising between the Parties  under or in connection with this Spin-off and 
Transfer Agreement or with regard to its validity,  including any disputes relating to the 
termination hereof or any subsequent amendment hereto,  will be finally decided by an 
arbitral tribunal  in accordance  with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber 
of Commerce ("ICC") in the relevant  valid version, and recourse to the jurisdiction of the 
state courts is excluded (except  for measures involving preliminary relief). A decision of 
30the arbitral tribunal regarding the validity  of this arbitration clause is legally binding. The 
place of arbitration is Munich.  The number of arbitrators is three.  Each Party appoints one 
arbitrator to be confirmed by the ICC. These two arbitrators appoint  the third arbitrator 
within 30 days of their appointment.  If the two arbitrators cannot agree on the third 
arbitrator within this period of time, the third arbitrator will be appointed by the ICC. The 
language of the proceedings is German.  An order for the presentation of documents is 
permitted only to the extent that any of the Parties refers explicitly to the documents  in its 
written submissions.  The consolidation of several arbitration proceedings pending at the 
ICC into singular arbitration proceedings is permitted only with the consent of both Parties. 
The Emergency Arbitrator  Provisions  do not apply. 
22.6 The annexes to this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement are part of  this Agreement.
22.7 Any claims under this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement  become statute-barred upon 
expiration of 31 December 2030, to the extent not otherwise provided for in this 
Agreement.
22.8 Amendments and supplements to this Spin-off and Transfer Agreement, including any 
amendment to or contracting-out of this provision, require written form  unless stricter 
requirements of form  must be complied with.
22.9 If one or more provisions in this Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement are or become  
completely or partially void, invalid or impracticable,  the validity  of this Spin-off and 
Transfer Agreement  and its other  provisions  will not be affected thereby. In such case, the 
void, invalid or impracticable provision will be deemed replaced by a provision that comes 
as close as possible  to what was originally intended  by the Parties in terms of form, content, 
time, measure and scope  of applicability  in accordance with the commercial intent  and 
purpose of the void, invalid  or impracticable  provision.  This applies  accordingly  if this 
Spin-off and Transfer Agreement  lacks  any provisions.

Preamble
0.1 Siemens AG with its registered  offices  in Berlin  and Munich  is registered with the register 
of companies (Handelsregister) at the district court (Amtsgericht) of Charlottenburg under 
registration number  HRB  12300  B and with the register  of companies  at the district court 
of Munich under registration number  HRB  6684. Siemens Beteiligungen  Inland GmbH  
with its registered  office in Munich is registered with the register of companies  at the 
district court  of Munich under  registration  number  HRB 139644 and is a wholly-owned 
direct subsidiary  of Siemens AG.
0.2 Siemens Energy AG with its registered  office in Munich  is registered with the register of 
companies at the district court  of Munich under registration  number HRB 252581. The 
capital stock of Siemens Energy  AG at the time of the conclusion of this Contribution 
Agreement amounts to EUR 100,000, divided  into 100,000 shares of no par value 
(registered shares).  The sole  shareholder  of Siemens  Energy AG is Siemens AG.
0.3 Siemens AG has decided to legally separate the worldwide operations of Gas and Power  
of the Siemens  Group to be legally  separated and the shares held by the Siemens Group  in 
the amount of approximately 67 % in Siemens  Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. ("SGRE 
S.A.") (together, the "Siemens Energy Business")  under Siemens Energy AG. For 
purposes of this legal separation, the Siemens Energy Business  is to be transferred  to 
Siemens Energy  AG through a combination  of a spin-off  pursuant  to the German 
Transformation Act (Umwandlungsgesetz, "UmwG")  and contributions, in each case in 
exchange for the granting of new shares.  The shares of Siemens Energy AG are to be listed 
on the Frankfurt  Stock Exchange.  Going forward,  Siemens Energy AG is to be conducted  
as an  entity that  is legally  and organizationally independent of Siemens AG. 
0.4 In preparation  of the legal  separation,  the Siemens Energy Business has been and will be 
legally and organizationally consolidated  under  the umbrella  of Siemens Gas and Power 
GmbH & Co. KG with its registered office in Munich and registered with the register  of 
companies at the district court  of Munich under registration number  HRA 111200, to be 
renamed Siemens  Energy Global  GmbH & Co. KG ("Siemens Energy  KG"). The fixed 
capital of Siemens Energy  KG amounts  to EUR 174,908,333 at the time of conclusion  of 
this Contribution Agreement. A partnership interest representing a pro rata amount  of the 
fixed capital of EUR 153,892,732 (approximately 87.98 % of the fixed capital) is held 
directly by Siemens AG. A partnership interest representing  the remaining  pro rata amount 
of the fixed capital of EUR 21,015,601 (approximately  12.02 % of the fixed  capital) is held 
by SBI GmbH. The sole personally liable  partner (general  partner) of Siemens Energy KG, 
– Convenience Translation – only the  German  version is binding –
Annex 0.5.3 to the Spin-Off  and Transfer  Agreement
3which holds no interest in its fixed capital,  is Siemens Gas and Power Management GmbH,  
a German  limited liability  company (GmbH), with its registered  office in Munich,  
registered with the register of companies  at the district court of Munich under HRB 241345 
("General Partner GmbH"). At the time of conclusion of this Contribution Agreement, 
the share capital of General Partner GmbH amounts to EUR 25,000, divided into 25,000 
shares, each with a nominal value  of EUR 1.00. At the time of conclusion of this 
Contribution Agreement,  approximately 87.98 % of that share  capital  (21,996 shares  
bearing the serial  numbers 1 through  21,996) are held by Siemens AG. The remaining 
approximately 12.02 % of the share  capital (3,004 shares bearing the serial numbers  21,997 
through 25,000)  is held  by SBI GmbH.
0.5 The majority interests in Siemens Energy  KG and General  Partner GmbH  are to be 
transferred by way of a spin-off  by absorption (Abspaltung zur Aufnahme ) pursuant  to the 
German Transformation Act from Siemens AG as the transferring entity to Siemens 
Energy AG as the receiving  entity (the "Spin-off").  As consideration, the shareholders of 
Siemens AG are to receive  new shares  in Siemens  Energy AG. For this purpose, Siemens 
Energy AG and Siemens AG are entering into a spin-off and transfer agreement in this 
same deed as of the date hereof. The Spin-off  takes economic effect as of 1 April 2020, 
0:00 hours (the "Spin-off Effective Date "). The tax transfer effective date of the Spin-off 
is 31 March 2020,  24:00 hours (the "Spin-off Tax Transfer Effective Date"). The Spin-
off takes legal  effect through its registration  with the registers of companies  of Siemens 
AG, with the later registration  being  determinative. If the Spin-off has not been registered 
with the registers  of companies of Siemens AG by the close  of 31 October 2020, the Spin-
off Effective Date  is deemed to be 1 October 2020, 0:00 hours, and the Spin-off Tax 
Transfer Effective Date  is deemed to be 30 September  2020, 24:00  hours. In the event of 
any further delay  of the registration beyond  31 October of any subsequent year, the Spin-
off Effective Date  and the Spin-off Tax Transfer Effective  Date are each postponed  
accordingly by one year.
0.6 Siemens AG intends not to completely  separate itself from  the Siemens Energy  Business 
in connection with the Spin-off, but, as a non-controlling anchor shareholder, would 
initially like to retain a (direct and indirect) minority participation  in Siemens  Energy  AG, 
which will be listed on the stock exchange  in the future, with a total participation  of 45 % 
of the share capital, of which 9,9 % of the share  capital shall be transferred  to Siemens 
Pension-Trust e.V. in connection with the Spin-off.  With the strategic and operational 
development of Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG, Siemens AG intends to reduce its 
stake in the amount  of 35,1 % in Siemens Energy AG significantly in a timeframe of twelve 
to eighteen months after the Spin-off  taking effect. To create such a participation, Siemens 
– Convenience Translation – only the  German  version is binding –
Annex 0.5.3 to the Spin-Off  and Transfer  Agreement
4AG, as the sole shareholder, intends to adopt the following  resolutions at the shareholders' 
meeting of Siemens Energy AG:
0.6.1 The capital stock of Siemens Energy  AG will be increased from  EUR 100,000 by 
EUR 239,582,401 to EUR 239,682,401 in return for the issuance  of 239,582,401 shares of 
no par value  (registered shares), each representing a pro rata amount of the capital stock 
of EUR 1.00. Siemens AG is to be permitted to subscribe for the new shares of no par 
value. The capital stock is to be increased  in return for contribution in kind,  which will be 
a mixed consideration.  In return  for the issuance of 239,582,401  new  shares  of no par value 
(registered shares)  in Siemens Energy  AG, Siemens AG will transfer  to Siemens Energy 
AG a partial  partnership interest in Siemens  Energy KG in the amount  of 
EUR 57,693,148.85 and 8,246 shares in General  Partner GmbH  bearing the serial 
numbers 13,751 through 21,996; in addition to the shares of no par value  to be granted, 
Siemens Energy  AG will pay to Siemens AG further consideration in the amount of 
EUR 175,746.41 plus interest  credited to bank accounts and intercompany clearing 
accounts of Siemens Energy AG from 1 April  2020  up to and including the date of 
disbursement or minus interest debited during  this period (referred to as a mixed 
contribution in kind). 
0.6.2 The capital  stock of Siemens Energy AG will additionally be increased from 
EUR 239,682,401 by EUR 87,307,936 to EUR 326,990,337  in return  for the issuance  of 
87,307,936 shares  of no par value (registered  shares), each representing a pro rata amount  
of the capital stock of EUR 1.00, under exclusion of the existing  shareholder's subscription 
right. SBI GmbH is to be permitted  to subscribe  for 87,307,936 new shares of no par value. 
In return  for the issuance  of the new shares  of no par value  in Siemens Energy AG, SBI 
GmbH will transfer to Siemens Energy  AG its partnership interest in Siemens Energy KG 
in the amount of EUR 21,015,601 and its 3,004 shares in General Partner GmbH  bearing 
the serial numbers 21,997 through  25,000. Additional  consideration  in the form of a cash 
payment is not intended.
0.7 The economic  effective date and the tax transfer date of the contributions in kind are to 
correspond to the Spin-off Effective  Date and the Spin-off Tax Transfer Effective Date. In 
the event of a postponement  of the Spin-off  Effective Date, these dates are to be postponed 
accordingly.
0.8 Siemens AG and SBI GmbH will make  the contributions  in kind in accordance with this 
Contribution Agreement. Only  the partial partnership interest remaining with Siemens  AG 
thereafter and the shares in General  Partner GmbH remaining  with Siemens AG thereafter 
will then be the subject  matter of the Spin-off.

Siemens AG's Mixed Contribution in Kind
§ 1
Subject of the  Contribution; Transfer
1.1 From  its partnership interest in Siemens Energy KG representing a pro rata amount of the 
fixed capital (capital account I)  of Siemens Energy  KG of EUR 153,892,732, Siemens AG 
contributes to Siemens Energy  AG a part thereof representing  a pro rata amount of the 
fixed capital  of EUR 57,693,148.85 (in words: fifty-seven  million six hundred ninety-three  
thousand one hundred  forty-eight  euros and eighty-five  euro cents)  ("Partnership Interest 
to be contributed by Siemens AG") as a contribution in kind.  In addition, Siemens AG 
contributes 8,246 (in words: eight thousand  two hundred  forty-six) shares in General  
Partner GmbH, which are listed in the latter's list of shareholders (Gesellschafterliste) with 
the serial  numbers 13,751 through 21,996, ("General  Partner  Shares  to be contributed

hereinafter together also referred to as "Siemens AG’s  Contribution in Kind")  to Siemens 
Energy AG as a  contribution in kind.
1.2 The Partnership Interest to be contributed  by Siemens AG is transferred  along with all 
related rights and duties, including the pertaining entitlement to all profits  that have thus 
far not been  withdrawn,  the balance on Siemens  AG's private account to be allocated on a 
pro rata basis to the Contributed  Partnership  Interest  to be contributed by Siemens AG, 
and the pro rata amount in the jointly held reserve account  (gesamthänderisch gebundenes 
Rücklagekonto) corresponding  to the pro rata amount  of the fixed  capital. The General  
Partner Shares to be contributed  by Siemens AG are transferred along with all related rights  
and duties,  including the entitlement to distribution  of all profits  that have  thus far not been 
distributed.
1.3 Existing  obligations  of Siemens  AG to make  contributions to Siemens Energy KG remain 
unaffected in its relationship  with Siemens  Energy KG and are not assumed by Siemens 
Energy AG in the  internal relationship.
1.4 From  its entire  partnership interest in Siemens Energy KG, Siemens AG hereby assigns  a 
part thereof in an amount  equivalent to EUR 57,693,148.85  (in words: fifty-seven million 
six hundred ninety-three thousand one hundred forty-eight euros and eight-five euro cents)  
of the fixed capital of Siemens Energy  KG (the Partnership Interest to be contributed  by

the ordinary course  of business and with the diligence of a prudent businessman  and in compliance  
with the requirements of this  Contribution  Agreement. 
§ 9
Indemnification  from Limited Partner Liability
If and to the extent that the personal  liability of Siemens AG is triggered  for liabilities of Siemens 
Energy KG because the contribution to liability capital  (Hafteinlage ) made by Siemens AG to 
Siemens Energy  KG is deemed to be paid back  to Siemens AG or one of the other measures 
specified in Section 172 (4) sentence 2 HGB has been taken  after the transfer in rem of the 
Partnership Interest to be contributed by Siemens AG without the liability capital  contribution 
having been returned in fact to Siemens AG or one of its affiliated companies, Siemens Energy  
AG must indemnify  Siemens AG against the relevant liability  or obligation  on first demand. This 
applies in particular in the event  that Siemens Energy  AG's notice  of succession  to specific rights  
– Convenience Translation – only the  German  version is binding –
Annex 0.5.3 to the Spin-Off  and Transfer  Agreement
11and obligations is not registered, or is not registered  in time, with the register of companies.  The 
same applies  if and to the extent that the personal  liability of SBI GmbH  is triggered for liabilities 
of Siemens Energy KG because  the contribution to liability  capital  made  by SBI GmbH to Siemens 
Energy KG is deemed  to be paid back to SBI GmbH or one of the other measures  specified  in 
Section 172 (4) sentence 2 HGB has been taken after the transfer  in rem of the Partnership Interest 
to be contributed  by SBI GmbH without the liability capital contribution having been  returned  in 
fact to SBI GmbH  or one of its affiliated  companies.
§ 10
Application  for Registration with the Register  of Companies
The Parties commit themselves to mutual cooperation in order to procure  the registration of the 
transfer of Siemens  AG's  Contributed  Partnership Interest and SBI GmbH's Contributed 
Partnership Interest to Siemens  Energy  AG with the register  of companies  of Siemens Energy KG 
promptly after this Contribution Agreement takes  effect pursuant  to § 13 of this Contribution 
Agreement. The registration of the transfer is to be accompanied by a notice  of succession to 
specific rights and obligations;  the Parties undertake to make all declarations necessary  for that 
purpose, including in particular  declarations regarding the payout of the liability capital  
contribution that has not taken place (negative compensation assurance (negative  
Abfindungsversicherung)).
§ 11
Waiver  of Conditions
Siemens AG may waive the condition precedent set forth in § 1.5 of this Contribution Agreement  
by notarized notice to Siemens  Energy  AG, which will result  in the assignments taking  effect 
immediately upon  receipt  of the notice  by Siemens Energy AG; Siemens Energy AG hereby agrees  
to this waiver of the condition precedent. SBI GmbH may also waive the condition precedent set 
forth in § 3.5 of this Contribution  Agreement by notarized notice to Siemens Energy  AG; in this 
respect as well,  Siemens Energy AG hereby agrees to this  waiver of the condition precedent. 
§ 12
Costs and  Transaction Taxes
12.1 The Parties assume that, as regards the entering into and implementation  of this 
Contribution Agreement, no value  added  tax (Umsatzsteuer) arises  because the transfer of 
Siemens AG’s Contribution in Kind and the transfer of SBI GmbH’s Contribution in Kind 
are either not subject to tax or are tax-exempt.  None of the Parties will waive any tax 
exemption of the services rendered under  this Contribution Agreement. If the tax 
– Convenience Translation – only the  German  version is binding –
Annex 0.5.3 to the Spin-Off  and Transfer  Agreement
12authorities take the view  that value added tax arises in connection with any of these events, 
the Parties  undertake  to take all lawful and reasonable measures  to prevent  such an 
assessment of value added tax and, if necessary, the unappealability (Unanfechtbarkeit) of 
such assessment. To the extent  that value  added tax is assessed nevertheless against 
Siemens AG and/or SBI GmbH,  Siemens Energy  AG is not obligated  to pay any additional 
amount to Siemens AG or to SBI GmbH as regards value added tax; however, to the extent 
that Siemens Energy AG has the right to deduct input tax (Vorsteuerabzug) as regards the 
value added  tax, Siemens Energy AG will pay to Siemens  AG and/or to SBI GmbH  an 
amount equal to the input tax deduction, provided that Siemens Energy AG may also fulfill 
this payment  obligation  by effectively  assigning any refund claim  against the tax office.  To 
the extent that value added tax is nevertheless  assessed against Siemens Energy  AG and 
Siemens Energy AG does not have  the right to deduct input tax, Siemens AG shall 
indemnify Siemens  Energy AG against value added tax and any interest thereon.
12.2 The costs of the notarization of this Contribution Agreement bears  Siemens AG. Siemens 
AG bears the other  costs that have  arisen or will arise for Siemens AG and Siemens Energy  
AG in connection with the notarization of this Contribution Agreement  and its 
implementation until the point in time of registration with the register of companies 
(including the costs for the audit of the contribution in kind and the post-formation audit  
as well as the corresponding  costs for advisors, the costs for the shareholders' meeting of 
Siemens Energy AG and the costs for filing for registration with the register  of companies) 
and any transaction taxes  (Verkehrsteuer)  (with  the exception of value added  tax, which  is 
provided for specifically  in § 12.1). SBI GmbH  bears  the other costs that have arisen  or 
will arise for SBI GmbH in connection with the notarization of this Contribution 
Agreement and its implementation.
§ 13
Effectiveness
This Contribution Agreement takes  effect when
(1) the shareholders'  meeting  of Siemens Energy AG has approved this Contribution 
Agreement as a  post-formation agreement and

Final Provisions
14.1 The Parties  will initiate  all necessary  or appropriate measures and legal acts and cooperate 
in them in order  to meet the obligations and implement the measures  set forth  in this 
Contribution Agreement.
14.2 In the event that the capital increases pursuant  to § 6 of this Contribution Agreement have  
not taken effect  by 31 March  2021 in each case, each of the Parties may withdraw from  
this Contribution  Agreement  by written declaration to the other Party.
14.3 Any disputes arising between the Parties  under or in connection with this Contribution 
Agreement or with regard to its effectiveness will be finally decided  by an arbitral tribunal 
in accordance with the Rules  of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce 
("ICC") in the relevant valid version, and recourse to the jurisdiction of the state courts is 
excluded (except  for measures involving preliminary  relief).  A decision of the arbitral 
tribunal regarding the validity of this arbitration  clause is binding. The place of arbitration 
is Munich. The number  of arbitrators is three. Each  Party  appoints one arbitrator to be 
confirmed by the ICC.  These  two arbitrators appoint  the third arbitrator within 30 days of 
their appointment. If the two arbitrators cannot  agree on the third arbitrator within this 
period of time, the third arbitrator  will be appointed  by the ICC. The language  of the 
proceedings is German.  An order for the presentation of documents is permitted  only to the 
extent that any of the Parties  refers explicitly  to the documents  in its written  submissions. 
The consolidation of several  arbitration proceedings pending at the ICC into singular  
arbitration proceedings is permitted  only with the consent of both Parties. The Emergency  
Arbitrator Provisions do not apply.
14.4 Amendments and supplements to this Contribution Agreement, including any amendment  
to or contracting-out of this provision, require  written  form unless stricter  requirements of 
form must be complied with.
14.5 Should any provision of this Contribution Agreement be or become  invalid or infeasible, 
the validity or feasibility of the other provisions of this Contribution Agreement will not 
be affected thereby. The invalid  or infeasible provision is deemed replaced by a legally  
valid provision  that comes as close as possible in economic  terms or otherwise to what the 
Parties had intended or would have intended based on the meaning and purpose of this 
Contribution Agreement  had they been aware  of the potential invalidity or infeasibility  of 
such provision. The same  applies to any unintended gap in  this Contribution  Agreement.

Annex  11.2.1 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
1Adjustment of Stock Entitlements (Aktienzusagen) Granted to Beneficiaries who Continue  
to be Employed in the Siemens Group  After the Spin-off Takes  Effect or who are Otherwise 
not Covered by § 11.2.2
The Stock Entitlements  listed in Annex 11.1 to the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement granted  to 
Beneficiaries who continue to be employed in the Siemens  Group  after the spin-off  takes  effect  or 
who are otherwise not covered by Section 11.2.2 will be adjusted as follows pursuant to 
Sections 23, 125, 133 of the German Transformation Act (Umwandlungsgesetz, "UmwG")  in 
conjunction with any provisions that are applicable  in the case of a spin-off and other provisions 
applicable under the relevant Stock Entitlements:  
1. Upon the Stock  Entitlements becoming  due (regularly  or early), the Beneficiary will 
receive, in addition to the number of shares  in Siemens AG to which the Beneficiary has a 
claim when the entitlements  become due (even if this claim  is compensated in cash under  
a discretionary decision  or under regular terms)  (the "Due Siemens Shares"),  in each case 
a cash payment for the notional  number  of shares of Siemens  Energy  AG which results  
from the ratio established in § 10.1 of the Spin-off  and Transfer Agreement based  on the 
number of Due Siemens Shares.  The amount of the cash payment will be determined  in 
accordance with the underlying provisions  of the relevant Stock  Entitlement  that would 
apply to a cash compensation or a cash settlement of Due Siemens Shares, subject to the 
proviso that the relevant price of the shares  of Siemens AG shall be replaced by the 
prevailing stock exchange price of the shares  of Siemens Energy AG. If, according to the 
underlying provisions of a Stock  Entitlement,  a cash payment is made to compensate for 
an additional notional number  of Siemens shares in lieu of delivering Due Siemens Shares 
upon a specific target achievement level being exceeded, that notional number of Siemens 
shares will be added  to the number  of Due Siemens  Shares for the purpose of determining 
the notional number of shares of  Siemens Energy  AG. 
2. The provision in no. 1 also applies  in the event that application of the adjustment provision  
in no. 1 results in a claim for cash payment for a (notional) fractional right to shares in 
Siemens Energy  AG. The amount of the cash payment corresponds  to the (commercially  
rounded) portion of the amount of the cash payment that results  under no. 1 for an entire 
share in Siemens Energy  AG corresponding  to the portion of the (commercially rounded)  
fractional right to a  share in Siemens Energy AG.
3. To the extent that the underlying  provisions of the Stock Entitlements, for example  for the 
SMP 2018, require an investment in shares  of Siemens  AG, no adjustment  will be made 
with respect to this investment.  To the extent that, after the spin-off has taken  effect,  the 
Beneficiaries receive  shares  of Siemens Energy AG as a result  of such investment or on 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  11.2.1 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
2the basis of any other investment in shares in Siemens AG, these shares in Siemens  Energy 
AG will not be subject  to a holding obligation.
4. If the number  of shares to be granted or, as the case may be, the specific claim under a 
Stock Entitlement  based  on the underlying provisions of a Stock Entitlement, for example 
the MA Stock Awards 2017, depends on achieving  certain targets  and the target  
achievement is influenced, at least partially, by how the stock  exchange price of the shares  
of Siemens AG or the relative  yield on shares develops during  the vesting period of the 
relevant Stock Entitlement,  after expiration of the relevant  vesting period, an adjustment  
of the parameters for the target achievement will be made  to the extent necessary in order  
to ensure equivalence among the Stock Entitlements (within the meaning of Sections 23, 
125 UmwG) for  the Beneficiaries before  and after  the spin-off.
5. The above  provisions do not apply to Stock Entitlements for jubilee shares, i.e., no 
adjustment will be made  for these  Stock Entitlements.
6. Under the UK Plan, shares in Siemens AG acquired by the Beneficiaries  ("Investment 
Shares") as well as shares  transferred  in this context by the relevant  company  ("Matching 
Shares") and/or shares  acquired  by re-investment of dividends ("Dividend Shares ") will 
be held by a trustee  on behalf  of the Beneficiaries (as beneficial owners)  in accordance 
with the provisions under the UK Plan. Therefore, the Beneficiaries will receive – as with 
all other  Siemens shareholders  – shares  in Siemens Energy AG for their Investment Shares, 
Matching Shares and any Dividend  Shares in the ratio specified in § 10.1 of the Spin-off 
and Transfer Agreement.  These shares in Siemens Energy AG will be subject to the same  
provisions under  the UK Plan, for example as regards  holding periods, that apply to the 
relevant Investment Shares, Matching  Shares and/or Dividend Shares that constitute  the 
bases for receiving the shares  in Siemens Energy AG. No further adjustment going  beyond 
the provision set forth in the  UK Plan will be made.
7. Aside from this, the other underlying  provisions of the Stock  Entitlements remain  
unaffected by the spin-off taking  effect.  This also applies to any reservations provided  for 
in the provisions of the Stock Entitlements  relating to settling or compensating claims for 
shares in Siemens AG in cash.
8. An adjustment under the above  provisions does not take place  due to the spin-off to the 
extent that an adjustment has been excluded or an agreement to the contrary has been made 
in the individual case or if an adjustment is not made in light of regulatory requirements in 
jurisdictions outside of Germany. 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  11.2.1 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
3The adjustments described above  will be made  in each case by the company that is the obligor  
under the relevant Stock Entitlements  upon the spin-off taking  effect.  Agreements made between 
companies of the Siemens Group (including the future Siemens Energy  Group)  about the technical 
processing of adjustments  or the internal allocation  of the burden will remain unaffected. 
The above adjustments apply accordingly in the event that further  stock entitlements  are granted 
in the period between  the signing date of the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement  and the effective 
date of the spin-off  which  are comparable in terms  of their structure with the Stock  Entitlements  
specified in Annex  11.1 to the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement and do not provide for any special 
arrangements applicable in the event of this spin-off.

1Adjustment of the Rights Under Stock Entitlements Granted  to Members of Corporate 
Bodies and Employees of the Future Siemens Energy Group  who Leave the Siemens Group 
upon the Spin-off Taking Effect
The Stock Entitlements granted to Beneficiaries  in the future  Siemens Energy Group  who leave 
the Siemens Group upon the spin-off taking effect  as listed  in Annex 11.1 to the Spin-off and 
Transfer Agreement  will be compensated  as follows in accordance with Sections 23, 125 of the 
German Transformation Act (Umwandlungsgesetz, "UmwG")  in conjunction with the provisions 
of the relevant Stock Entitlements that are applicable in the case of a spin-off and/or the departure 
from the Siemens Group:  
1. The claims of the Beneficiaries under the Stock Entitlements cease to exist upon the spin-
off taking effect  and will be compensated or settled in cash after the spin-off has taken  
effect in accordance with nos.  2 to 4 below.
2. As regards the MA-Stock-Awards-2017, MA-Stock-Awards-2018, MA-Stock-Awards-
2019, MA-Stock-Awards-2020,  MA-Stock-Awards-SZ-2017, MA-Stock-Awards-SZ-
2018, MA-Stock-Awards-SZ-2019/1,  MA-Stock-Awards-SZ-2019/2,  MA-Stock-Awards-
SZ-2020, MA-Hi-Tech-Mendix (performance-oriented),  MA-Hi-Tech-Mendix,  MA-Hi-
Tech-Business-2019 and  MA-Hi-Tech-Business-2020, the following applies: 
The amount of the cash payment  for each Siemens Stock  Award corresponds  to the closing 
price of the Siemens shares in Xetra trading  on the closing date of the spin-off, less the 
present value  of the dividend  expected  to be distributed up until the end of the relevant 
vesting period.
3. As regards SMP-2018, SMP-2019,  SMP-2020, BAP-2018, BAP-2019,  BAP-2020, the 
following applies: 
The amount of the cash compensation  for each matching  share corresponds to the portion 
of the closing price of the Siemens shares in Xetra  trading on the closing date of the spin-
off equal to the proportion that the holding period up until the closing date of the spin-off 
bears to the  entire duration  of the relevant holding period.
4. As regards the  UK Plan, the following applies: 
After the initial listing  of Siemens Energy AG on the stock exchange, the UK Plan will be 
dissolved as soon as possible in accordance with the applicable provisions. All the shares 
(i.e., investment  shares,  matching shares and, if applicable, dividend shares, as well as the 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  11.2.2 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
 
2relevant shares in Siemens Energy  AG that the Beneficiaries – as well as all other  
shareholders of Siemens  AG – receive with respect to their investment shares, matching 
shares and, if applicable, dividend shares) which are held by the trustee on behalf  of the 
Beneficiaries are either to be transferred to the relevant Beneficiary or to be sold for the 
account of the relevant  Beneficiary. The number of matching shares will not be reduced 
irrespective of  the early termination of the  UK Plan. 
For the group of persons  that is the subject of this Annex, there are no Stock  Entitlements relating 
to Siemens  jubilee  shares for the time after the spin-off has taken effect.  No adjustments need to 
be made to the VS-Stock-Awards-2017, VS-Stock-Awards-2018, VS-Stock-Awards-2019, VS-
Stock-Awards-2020 as no managing board member of Siemens AG will leave  the Siemens Group  
upon the spin-off taking  effect. 
No settlement or compensation  payment  pursuant  to the above provisions will be made to the 
extent that such payment has been  excluded or an agreement to the contrary  has been made in the 
individual case. Taxes and duties payable on the cash settlement  or the cash compensation  are to 
be borne  by the Beneficiary  subject to the provisions of  the Stock Entitlements.
The settlement and compensation payments  described above will be made  in each case by the 
company that is the obligor under the relevant  Stock Entitlements upon the spin-off taking effect.  
Agreements made between companies of the Siemens Group (including the future Siemens Energy 
AG Group) about the technical processing  of adjustments or the internal allocation of the burden 
will remain unaffected.
The above adjustments apply accordingly in the event that further  stock entitlements  are granted 
in the period between  the signing date of the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement  and the effective 
date of the spin-off  which  are comparable in terms  of their structure with the Stock  Entitlements  
specified in Annex 11.1 to the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement, provided that they do not include 
any special  arrangements applicable in the event of this spin-off.

hundred twenty-six million six hundred forty-five thousand one hundred  ninety-three 
Euro).
(2) The capital stock is divided into 726,645,193  shares of no par value.  The shares shall be

Company’s share  register,  the Company’s shareholders  shall provide all information as 
legally required.
(3) The right of shareholders  to have their ownership interests  evidenced by document shall 
be excluded, unless such evidence is required by law or under the regulations  of a stock 
exchange on which the shares  are listed. The Company  is entitled to issue  share

2025, with the approval  of the Supervisory Board, by up to EUR 363.322.596 nominal 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version is  binding  –
Annex 13.1 to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement
4through the issuance of up to 363.322.596 no-par value shares registered in the name of 
the holders against contributions in cash and/or in kind. The authorization may be used 
once or multiple  times, and all at once or in installments. The new shares shall 
participate in profits  from the beginning of the fiscal  year in which  they have been  issued. 
To the extent  permitted  by law, the Managing Board, with the approval of the 
Supervisory Board,  can stipulate in deviation from the above and Section 60 (2) of the 
German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) that the new shares shall participate  in 
profits from the beginning  of a fiscal  year that has already ended and for which  no 
resolution on appropriation  of the net income has been  adopted by the Annual 
Shareholders’ Meeting at the time the shares are issued. With the approval of the 
Supervisory Board, the Managing Board shall be authorized to determine  the further 
details of the share  rights and the conditions of the issuance of shares (Authorized 
Capital 2020).  The new shares  must generally be offered to the shareholders  for 
subscription; they can also be assumed by credit  institutions or enterprises within the 
meaning of Section  186 (5) sentence 1 of the German Stock  Corporation  Act 
(Aktiengesetz) with the obligation that they must be offered to the shareholders for 
subscription. However, with the approval  of the Supervisory Board, the Managing Board 
is authorized to exclude shareholders’  subscription rights in the event of capital 
increases against  contributions in cash:
- in order to grant  shares  to the employees of the Company and its affiliates 
(employee shares). Such new shares can also be issued through  a credit  institute 
or a company within the meaning of Section 53 (1) sentence 1 or Section 53b (1) 
sentence 1, or Section  53b (7) of the Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz),  which at 
first assumes the shares  for the exclusive offer to employees  of the Company 
and its affiliates. As far as permitted by law, the employee shares  may also be 
issued by covering  the contribution to be made for them from the part of the 
annual net profit  which the Managing  Board and the Supervisory Board  are 
permitted to incorporate into other retained  earnings pursuant  to Section 58 (2) of 
the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz),
- in as far as this is necessary for fractional amounts resulting from the subscription 
ratio,
- in order to grant holders/creditors of conversion or option rights  on the 
Company’s shares  or of respective conversion obligations from bonds issued or 
guaranteed by the Company or any of its consolidated  subsidiaries subscription  
rights as compensation  against  effects  of dilution  to the extent to which  they 
would be entitled  upon exercising such conversion  or option  rights  or fulfilling 
such conversion  obligations,
- Convenience Translation – only the German version is  binding  –
Annex 13.1 to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement
5- provided  that the issue price  of the new shares is not significantly lower than the 
stock exchange  price of the Company’s  listed shares.  The calculated  proportion  
of the capital stock  to be allocated to the shares  issued in accordance with 
Section 186 (3) sentence  4 of the German Stock Corporation  Act (Aktiengesetz) 
against contributions in cash under exclusion of the subscription  rights must not 
exceed 10 % of the capital stock. Applicable in this case  is the capital stock at the 
time this authorization becomes  effective or, if this amount is lower, at the time at 
which this authorization is used.  This limit shall include shares  issued or divested  
in direct or mutatis mutandis application  of these provisions during the term of 
this authorization  up to the time of it being  used. Likewise included are shares 
that have been  issued or granted  or are to be issued  or granted  on the basis  of a 
convertible bond  or warrant bond  issued during  the term of this authorization, with 
shareholders’ subscription  rights excluded in accordance with Section  186 (3) 
sentence 4 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz ),
- through  the implementation of a so-called share  dividend, in which the 
shareholders are given the opportunity  to contribute to the Company their 
dividend claim  (either entirely  or partially) as a contribution  in kind in exchange for 
the grant  of new shares  from the Authorized Capital 2020.
The calculated proportion of capital stock to be allocated to the shares issued under  
exclusion of the shareholder  subscription  rights may not exceed  EUR 72.664.519  
nominal. Included in the calculation of this capital  limit shall be the capital stock that is 
allocated to those new shares, which for the duration of this authorization under 
exclusion of subscription rights  are issued or are to be issued on the basis of 
conversion/option rights or conversion obligations  under bonds,  to the extent that such 
bonds were issued under exclusion of shareholder  subscription rights during the term of 
the authorization.
(6) The capital stock is conditionally increased by up to EUR 72.664.519 (Conditional 
Capital 2020). The conditional capital  increase  shall be implemented  through  issue of up 
to 72.664.519  no-par value shares registered in the name of the holders only insofar  as 
the holders and/or creditors of convertible  bonds or of option warrants  from option  
bonds, which are issued by Siemens Energy  AG or one of its consolidated subsidiaries  
up until the end of 31. July 2025  on the basis of the authorization of the Managing Board 
through the General Meeting of [] 2020, exercise  their conversion/option  rights  or 
perform their conversion obligation  and no other forms  of fulfillment are used to service 
these rights. The issue of the new shares shall be made at the conversion/option  prices 
to be determined, subject to the above  authorization resolution, in the terms and 
conditions of the bonds or options. The Managing Board  is authorized to decide on the 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version is  binding  –
Annex 13.1 to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement
6further details of the implementation of the conditional capital increase. The issued 
shares shall participate  in profits from the beginning of the fiscal  year in which they have 
been issued; to the extent permitted by law, the Managing  Board  can stipulate in 
deviation from the above and Section 60 (2) of the German  Stock Corporation  Act 
(Aktiengesetz) that the new shares shall participate in profits  from the beginning of a 
fiscal year that has already ended.

SUPERVISORY  BOARD
§ 7
Composition, Elections, Term of Office
(1) The Supervisory Board shall have twenty members, ten elected by the Shareholders’ 
Meeting, and ten elected  in accordance  with the provisions of the German 
Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz).
(2) Unless otherwise specified at the time of their election, the term of office of the members  
of the Supervisory Board shall expire at the close  of that Shareholders’ Meeting  which  is 
called upon  to ratify the acts of the Supervisory  Board for the fourth fiscal year after the 
beginning of their term of office.  From  this calculation shall be excluded the fiscal year 
during which such term of office  begins.  An election to replace a member that leaves the 
Supervisory Board prior to the expiry  of his or her term of office  shall – unless otherwise 
specified at the time of the election - continue for the remainder  of the term of office of 
the member who has left the Supervisory Board.  The same shall apply should  a 
replacement election become  necessary because the original election was contested.
(3) The General Meeting  may, simultaneously with the election of the Supervisory Board  
members, appoint replacement  members, who shall replace, in a sequence to be 
determined upon  the election, any Supervisory Board  members  of the shareholders who 
leave office prematurely or due to a contestation of the election. If a replacement  
member replaces a member who has left the Supervisory Board, his or her office shall 
expire at the end of the General Meeting during which a replacement election pursuant 
to § 7 (2) above  takes place, at the latest, however,  upon  expiry of the term of office of 
the Supervisory Board  member who has left. Should the replacement  member  who has 
left office after a replacement election  have been appointed as a replacement member 
for several Supervisory Board members,  his or her status as a replacement  member 
shall be renewed.  The election of replacement members with respect  to the Supervisory 
Board members  of the employees  shall occur pursuant  to the German  Codetermination 
Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz).
(4) Any Supervisory Board  member and replacement member may resign his or her office,  
also without cause,  by giving one month’s written notice to the chairman  of the 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version is  binding  –
Annex 13.1 to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement
8Supervisory Board - or, if the chairman wishes to resign, to his or her deputy pursuant  to 
§ 8 (1) 1 below. The chairman or, if the Chairman wishes  to resign, the deputy chairman, 
shall be free to reduce the period of notice or waive compliance with the period of notice. 
§ 8
Chairman and Deputy Chairman
(1) From among  its members, the Supervisory  Board shall elect  in accordance with the 
German Codetermination  Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz)  a chairman and a deputy 
chairman. The Supervisory  Board may elect one or several other deputy chairmen and 
Section 27 of the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz) does not apply 
to such election.  The election should  take place after the General Meeting during which  
the Supervisory Board members to be elected by the General Meeting were  newly 
elected; a separate invitation to this meeting is not required.
(2) The term of office of the chairman and the deputy chairman shall, unless a shorter period 
of office is determined at the time of the election, correspond to their term of office as 
members of the Supervisory Board.
(3) Should  the chairman or the deputy  chairman leave office prematurely, a new election for 
such position shall take place immediately. A revocation of the election of the chairman 
or the deputy  chairman is only permitted  for sufficient cause. The ongoing inability of the 
chairman or the deputy  chairman to discharge the duties of office shall be deemed to 
constitute sufficient cause. For the revocation of the election of the chairman or the 
deputy chairman, the relevant provisions of the German  Codetermination Act 
(Mitbestimmungsgesetz) with respect to their election are accordingly applicable. 
(4) A deputy chairman performing the duties of the chairman when  the latter  is unable  to act 
shall be vested with all the powers  of the chairman, except for the second vote accorded 
to the chairman pursuant to the German Codetermination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz) 
or these Articles of Association.
(5) Declarations  by the Supervisory  Board shall be made on behalf of the Supervisory Board 
by the chairman or, if he or she is unable to act, by the deputy  chairman. The chairman 
or, if he or she is unable to act, the deputy chairman  shall have the right to accept 
declarations on behalf of the Supervisory Board.

(1) The Supervisory Board shall have all rights and duties assigned  to it by law and by these 
Articles of Association.
(2) The Supervisory Board shall determine in the rules  of procedure for the Managing Board 
or for the Supervisory Board or by a resolution that specific transactions or types of 
transactions are only permitted with the Supervisory Board’s  approval.
(3) The Supervisory Board may grant approval in advance  for a certain group of 
transactions, subject to revocation, in general or in case that the relevant  individual  
transaction satisfies certain requirements.
(4) The Supervisory  Board may pass resolutions on amendments to the Articles  of

Annex 13.2 to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement
1Authorization to Acquire and Use Treasury Shares pursuant to Section 71 (1) No. 8 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, "AktG") and to Exclude  Subscription  and 
Tender Rights
a) The company  is authorized to acquire until the end of 31 July 2025 for any permissible 
purpose treasury shares in an amount of up to 10 % of the capital stock  existing at the time 
this authorization takes effect or – if this amount  is lower – of the capital stock existing  at 
the time the authorization is exercised.  The shares acquired  under  this authorization together 
with other  shares  of the company  already  acquired and still held by the company or which 
are attributable to it pursuant to Sections 71d and 71e AktG, must not, at any time, represent 
more than 10 %  of the relevant  capital  stock.
b) Shares in Siemens  Energy AG ("Siemens Energy Shares ") will be acquired, at the option 
of the managing  board,  (1) by purchase via the stock  exchange, (2) by means of a public 
purchase offer or (3) through a public  offer  to swap  Siemens Energy Shares for shares in a 
listed company  within the meaning  of Section 3 (2) AktG. Offers  pursuant to nos. (2) and 
(3) above may also be made by means of an  invitation  to submit offers.
(1) In the case of acquisition of the Siemens Energy Shares via stock exchange,  the 
purchase price  per Siemens Energy Share (without  ancillary  costs for the acquisition)  
paid by the company on the stock  exchange  must not exceed  the price per Siemens 
Energy Share  determined by the opening auction in Xetra trading (or in a comparable 
successor system) on the stock exchange  trading day by more  than 10 % or fall below 
such price by more  than 20 %.
(2) In the case of acquisition of the Siemens Energy Shares via public  purchase  offer, 
the purchase price  paid per Siemens Energy Share (without ancillary costs for the 
acquisition) must not exceed the average closing  price  per Siemens Energy Share  in 
Xetra trading (or in a comparable  successor system) on the fourth, third and second 
stock exchange  trading day preceding the decision of the managing board on the offer 
or on the acceptance of offers of the shareholders  by more than 10 % or fall below 
such price by more  than 20 %.
(3) In the case of acquisition of the Siemens Energy Shares through a public  offer to 
swap Siemens Energy  Shares for shares  in a listed  company  within the meaning of 
- Convenience  Translation  – only  the German version is binding –
Annex 13.2 to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement
2Section 3 (2) AktG ("Swap Shares"), the swap price paid by the company per 
Siemens Energy Share  (in the form of one or several Swap Shares,  any fractional  
shares and any cash component) (without ancillary costs for the acquisition) must  not 
exceed the applicable  value of a Siemens  Energy Share by more than 10 % or fall 
below such value by more than 20 %. The basis for calculating the applicable value 
will in each case be the average closing  price  of each Siemens Energy Share  and of 
each Swap Share in Xetra trading (or in a comparable  successor system) on the 
fourth, third and second stock exchange trading  day preceding the decision of the 
managing board on the offer or on acceptance of the offer of the shareholders. If the 
Swap Shares are not traded in Xetra trading, the applicable closing price will be the 
closing price  on the stock exchange  where there  was the highest trading  volume in 
the Swap Shares in the preceding calendar year  expired.
The managing  board will determine the further details of the relevant acquisition process. If 
the number  of Siemens Energy Shares tendered  or offered for purchase  or swap exceeds the 
total volume  of shares the company  intends  to acquire, the shareholders' tender right may be 
excluded such that the acquisition will be made based on the proportion of the number of 
Siemens Energy Shares  tendered or offered per shareholder. The acquisition process may 
provide for a preferred acquisition  or acceptance respectively of small numbers of up to 150 
Siemens Energy Shares tendered or offered per shareholder as well as a rounding  according 
to commercial principles. 
If, following the publication of an offer, there are deviations  from the price or, as the case 
may be, from a price  range determined  in the context  of the invitation to submit offers  which  
may be significant as regards the success  of the offer, the price  or the price range  may be 
adjusted during the offer  period or until acceptance of the offer. In this case,  the relevant 
10% and 20% thresholds for exceeding or falling below  the relevant price are based on the 
corresponding closing  price  of the Siemens Energy Share or of the Swap  Shares as the case 
may be on the last stock exchange trading  day prior to the final decision by the managing 
board on the adjustment.
c) The managing board is authorized to use the treasury  shares acquired  on the basis of this 
authorization in addition to selling them  for any permissible purpose via the stock exchange 
or by means of an offer  to all shareholders proportionately  according to their shareholding 
and, in particular,  as follows:
- Convenience  Translation  – only  the German version is binding –
Annex 13.2 to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement
3(1) The shares can be cancelled without  the cancellation or its implementation  requiring 
any further resolution by the shareholders' meeting. The cancellation  will result in a 
reduction of capital; in this case,  the managing board is authorized to reduce the 
capital stock  by the pro rata amount of the capital stock  attributable to the shares 
cancelled and the supervisory board is authorized to amend the number  of shares and 
the capital stock specified  in the articles of association accordingly.  By decision of 
the managing board, the cancellation may also be implemented in accordance with 
Section 237 (3) no. 3 AktG without a capital reduction  by adjusting  the pro rata 
amount of the remaining  shares  of no par value in the capital  stock of the company 
in accordance with Section 8 (3) AktG. In this event, the managing board is 
authorized to amend  the number  of shares  of no par value in the articles  of 
association.
(2) The shares may be used as part of remuneration and/or employee stock-based 
compensation programs  of the company or its affiliated companies and may be issued 
to persons  who are or were employed  with the company  or any of its affiliated 
companies as well as to members of corporate bodies  of affiliated companies of the 
company. They  may be offered for sale, awarded or transferred to the aforesaid  
persons and members  of corporate bodies (against  consideration or not) provided that 
the employment or service  relationship or membership  must still exist at the time of 
the offer, award  or transfer.
(3) With the approval of the supervisory  board,  they may be sold against cash payment 
if the sales price  is not significantly below  the stock  exchange price of a Siemens 
Energy Share. The notional pro rata amount of the capital stock  attributable to shares  
used in this way must not exceed 10 % of the capital stock. Applicable  in this case is 
the capital stock  at the time the authorization becomes effective or, if this amount is 
lower, at the time when the authorization is used. When  calculating  the 
aforementioned limit, shares have  to be taken  into account that are issued during the 
term of this acquisition authorization  in direct  or analogous application of 
Section 186 (3) sentence  4 AktG until the point in time of its use. Likewise included 
are shares  that are to be issued or granted on the basis of a convertible bond or warrant 
bond issued during the term of this authorization, with shareholders’ subscription 
rights excluded  in accordance  with Section 186 (3) sentence  4 AktG .
- Convenience  Translation  – only  the German version is binding –
Annex 13.2 to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement
4(4) The shares can be used to service or secure obligations or rights to acquire Siemens 
Energy Shares specifically  under  or in connection with convertible  bonds  and warrant  
bonds issued by the company  or its group companies.  Furthermore, the managing 
board is authorized  to exclude the subscription right in order to grant 
holders/creditors of conversion or option rights in respect  of shares of the company 
or corresponding  conversion  obligations subscription rights as compensation against  
the effects of dilution in the amount in which  they would  be entitled to such rights  
upon exercising these rights or after fulfilling  these obligations and to use treasury 
shares to service such  subscription rights.
(5) They  may be used to float shares  of the company on foreign  stock exchanges on 
which they are currently  not listed. The price at which  these  shares are floated on 
foreign stock exchanges must not be more than 5 % lower than the arithmetic  mean 
of the prices  (without ancillary  costs for the acquisition)  of the shares of no par value 
of the company  in the closing auction  in Xetra trading  (or in a corresponding 
successor system)  on the Frankfurt  Stock Exchange during the last three stock 
exchange trading  days prior  to the shares being floated on the foreign stock exchange.
d) The supervisory board  is authorized to use the treasury shares acquired  on the basis of this 
authorization as follows: 
The shares  can be used to service obligations or rights  to acquire Siemens Energy Shares  
that have been or will be agreed with members  of the managing board of Siemens  Energy 
AG in the context  of the provisions on compensation for the managing board. They may 
specifically be offered for purchase, awarded or transferred to the members of the managing  
board of Siemens  Energy AG provided  that the service relationship of that member or the 
board membership must  exist at the time of  the offer, award or transfer.
e) The authorizations included in this resolution may be exercised in each case independently 
of each other,  once  or several  times, individually or collectively, in their entirety or partially 
also by group companies  or by third parties  acting for the account  of the company or its 
group companies.  Furthermore, treasury shares acquired may also be transferred to group 
companies.
f) The subscription right of the shareholders  with respect to treasury  shares  acquired is 
excluded to the extent  that these shares  are used in accordance  with the above authorizations 
under lit. c) nos. (2) to (5) and lit. d). In the case of an offer to acquire treasury shares made 
- Convenience  Translation  – only  the German version is binding –
Annex 13.2 to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement
5to all shareholders, the subscription right of shareholders  may also be excluded for fractional 
amounts.
This resolution comes into force (condition precedent)  only upon the taking  effect of (the 
implementation of) the increase of the capital stock  of Siemens Energy AG for the 
implementation of the spin-off of the participations in Siemens Gas and Power  GmbH & Co. 
KG and in Siemens Gas and Power Management  GmbH from Siemens Aktiengesellschaft  
to Siemens Energy AG.

1Authorization to Issue  Convertible Bonds/Warrant Bonds, to Exclude the Subscription  
Right for these  Convertible Bonds/Warrant Bonds  as well as the Authorization for the 
Supervisory Board  to Amend  § 4 para. 1, para 2 sentence 1 and para. 6 of the Articles of 
Association 
(1) General Provisions;  Thresholds; Issuance Against Contribution in Cash or in Kind and 
Through Group Companies;  Limitation in Time  of the Authorization
The managing board is authorized to issue once  or several times, also simultaneously 
in various tranches, subordinated or unsubordinated  convertible bonds/warrant bonds 
(together with all the bond structures possible under this resolution hereinafter referred  
to as the "Bonds")  in the total nominal amount of up to EUR 4,000,0000,000 and, in 
this context, to grant/impose  conversion  and/or  option rights and conversion obligations 
in respect of registered shares of no par value  in Siemens Energy AG ("Siemens Energy  
Shares") representing  a pro rata amount in its capital  stock  totaling up to 
EUR 72,664,519 (" Maximum Pro Rata  Amount of the Capital Stock ").
The Bonds may also be issued by a group company of Siemens Energy AG. The 
authorization also covers  the option to assume guarantees for the Bonds issued through  
group companies of the company,  to grant  the holders or creditors of such Bonds  
conversion and/or option rights or impose conversion obligations upon them in respect 
of Siemens Energy shares within  the scope of the Maximum  Pro Rata Amount of the 
Capital Stock, and to make (all) further  declarations and take (all) further  actions 
required for a successful issuance. 
The Bonds may be issued for financing purposes (raising of debt or equity  capital), but 
also for other  purposes such as the optimization of the company's capital structure.
The Bonds  may be issued against contribution in cash and/or in kind.  Warrant bonds 
may be issued against contribution in kind to the extent that the terms and conditions  of 
the warrants provide for full payment  in cash of the option price  per Siemens Energy 
share upon exercise.  The nominal amount  of the Bonds or an issue price  of the Bonds 
below the nominal amount may also be chosen  such that it corresponds to the pro rata 
amount of the capital  stock  represented by the shares to be issued in accordance with 
the terms and conditions of the Bonds  or the warrants, respectively (hereinafter the 
"Terms  and Conditions of the Bonds"), i.e., the relevant nominal amount or issue 
price need  not necessarily exceed such amount.
The authorization for the issuance of Bonds expires  on the end  of 31 July 2025.
- Convenience Translation – only  the German version is binding –
Annex 13.3 to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement
2(2) Conversion Obligation, Issuer's Right to Grant Shares in Lieu of Repayment of the 
Bonds
The terms and conditions  of convertible bonds may also stipulate a conversion 
obligation upon maturity  (or at an earlier time or when a specific event occurs). The 
terms and conditions may also stipulate the right of the issuer, upon final maturity of a 
Bond with warrants,  conversion rights or obligations attached  (this also includes 
maturity due to termination), to grant  the holders  or creditors shares of no par value in 
the company  or in another listed company instead of paying, in whole or in part, the 
monetary amount due upon maturity.
(3) Conversion/Option Price per  Share
In the case of warrant  bonds, each individual bond (unit) has option rights  attached to 
it (specifically in the form of one or more warrant(s))  that entitle the holder  or creditor  
to receive Siemens Energy shares,  in accordance with the Terms  and Conditions of the 
Bonds.
In the case of convertible bonds, the holders/creditors of the convertible bonds are 
granted the right  and/or  are obliged to convert their convertible bonds  into Siemens 
Energy shares in accordance with the Terms  and Conditions of the  Bonds.
In all cases,  the conversion or exchange or subscription ratio is obtained by dividing  the 
nominal amount or the lower issue price of a convertible bond or, upon exercise of a 
warrant, the amount owed under  the warrant terms, by the respective conversion or 
option price stipulated for  one Siemens  Energy  share.
The pro rata amount  of the capital  stock represented by the shares subscribed for on 
the basis of a convertible bond or, in the case of trade-in, of a warrant bond, must not 
exceed the nominal amount or the  lower issue price of  the Bonds.
The relevant  conversion/option price per share  at the time of issuance must not,  except 
where there  is a conversion obligation,  fall below 80 % of the price of the Siemens 
Energy share in Xetra trading (or in a comparable  successor  system). The average 
closing price on the ten stock exchange  trading  days prior  to the final decision of the 
managing board on the issuance of the Bonds or, following  a public solicitation to 
submit subscription offers,  on the  company's acceptance of such offers.
Alternatively, if the shareholders' subscription right  has not been excluded,  the price on 
the stock exchange trading days during the subscription period  may be used as a basis 
(excepting those days of the subscription period  that are necessary to announce the

Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz, "AktG").
In the case of Bonds with a conversion  obligation, the conversion price may at least 
either equal the minimum price  set out above or correspond to the volume-weighted 
average price of the Siemens Energy  share  on at least the three trading days in Xetra  
trading (or in a comparable  successor  system) immediately preceding  the determination  
of the conversion price in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds, even 
if this average price and the relevant  conversion  price derived therefrom are below the 
minimum price (80%) set out above.  Section 9 (1) AktG and Section 199 (2) AktG  
remain unaffected.
(4) Dilution  Protection, Adjustments and Further  Structuring Possibilities
The authorization also provides for the option to grant protection against dilution or 
make adjustments  in certain cases  in accordance with the respective Terms and 
Conditions of the Bonds. Protection against dilution or adjustments may especially be 
contemplated in the event that there are changes  in the capital of the company during 
the term of the Bonds or the warrants (for example,  in the event  of a capital increase or 
reduction in capital or a share split), but also in connection  with dividend payments,  the 
issuance of additional convertible bonds/warrant bonds, transformation  measures as 
well as in the case of other events affecting the value of the option or conversion rights  
or the conversion obligation occurring during the term of the Bonds  or the warrants (for 
example, in the event of acquisition of control  by a third party).  Protection  against 
dilution or adjustments can especially be provided  by granting  subscription rights,  by 
changing the conversion/option price and by changing or granting cash  components. 
The managing board is authorized to determine  the conditions  of issue and the 
additional Terms and Conditions  of the Bonds  or to do so in consultation with the 
respective group company  issuing the Bonds.  The Terms and Conditions of the Bonds  
can especially also provide  for and stipulate the following:  
- whether and, if so, under  what  conditions – for example based on an election 
right of the issuer or of Siemens Energy  AG, as applicable, – the Bonds may be 
serviced from  conditional  capital (in particular from  Conditional Capital 2020 
to be created under  the present  authorization),  from  authorized capital  already  
existing or still to be created, from holdings of treasury  shares already  existing 
or still to be acquired, or – in lieu of delivery of Siemens Energy  shares – 
settlement may be made  by way of a corresponding cash payment or delivery of 
other securities negotiable on another trading  venue within the meaning of 
- Convenience Translation – only  the German version is binding –
Annex 13.3 to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement
4Section 2 (22) of the German Securities Trading Act 
(Wertpapierhandelsgesetz),
- whether the  Bonds  or warrants  be issued in bearer or registered  form,
- number and design  of the warrants  (which  may be designed differently) to be 
attached to each individual bond (unit) and whether these  will be detachable 
upon or after issuing,
- coupon and term to maturity – including unlimited or deviating terms - of the 
Bonds or  warrants,
- structure and design of the bond component which may specifically  comprise 
so-called hybrid  bonds,
- whether, in the case of warrant bonds, payment of the option price may be made 
in whole or in part  by way  of transfer of  individual bond  units  (trade-in), 
- whether the conversion  price(s)/option  price(s) or the conversion, subscription 
or exchange ratios are to be determined upon issuing  the Bonds  or during  the 
term of the Bonds or warrants,  and how these  prices/ratios are to be determined  
in each case (stating any minimum  and maximum  prices and variable designs or 
stipulating a determination on the basis of future stock  exchange prices); the 
requirements pursuant to no.  3 above remain  unaffected,
- whether and  how  there  will be  rounding to a full share conversion ratio,
- whether an additional payment  to be rendered  in cash or cash compensation will 
be established,
- how the details of the exercise,  the performance of obligations or rights, the 
deadlines and the setting of the conversion prices/option prices  are to be 
determined in the case of mandatory  conversion obligations,
- whether the Bonds  will be issued in euros or in other legal currencies of OECD  
countries. For the purpose of determining the maximum  aggregate  nominal 
amount of this authorization  in the case of issues in foreign currencies, the 
nominal amount of the Bonds shall in each case be converted into euros on the 
day when the  decision on the issue thereof  is taken.

5(5) Subscription Right, Authorization to Exclude the Subscription Right
Generally, the Bonds  must be offered for subscription to the shareholders. They may 
also be issued  to credit institutions or to companies  operating pursuant  to Section 53 (1) 
sentence 1 or Section 53b (1) sentence  1 or (7) of the German Banking Act (Gesetz über 
das Kreditwesen, "KWG") with the obligation to offer  them  for subscription to 
shareholders. However, the managing board is authorized, with the consent of the 
supervisory board, to exclude the  subscription right
- provided that the Bonds are issued against cash payment  and the issue price of 
a Bond  is not significantly  lower than its theoretical  market price computed in 
accordance with generally accepted actuarial  methods. The notional share in the 
capital stock  attributable to shares to be issued or granted  under the Bonds that 
were issued based  on this authorization  under exclusion of the subscription right 
pursuant to Section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG  must not exceed 10% of the capital 
stock. Applicable in this case is the capital  stock  at the time this authorization 
becomes effective or, if this amount is lower, at the time at which  this 
authorization is used. When calculating  the aforementioned  limit,  shares have 
to be taken into account  that are issued or disposed of in direct or analogous 
application of Section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG during the term of this 
authorization until the point in time of its use. Likewise included  are shares that 
have been issued  or granted or are to be issued  or granted  on the basis of a 
convertible bond or warrant  bond issued during the term of this authorization, 
with shareholders’ subscription rights excluded in accordance with Section 186 
(3) sentence 4  AktG, 
- to the extent necessary for fractional  amounts  resulting from  the subscription 
ratio,
- in order to grant holders/creditors of conversion or option rights  to shares  of the 
company or of conversion  obligations under Bonds issued  or guaranteed  by the 
Siemens Energy AG or any of its group companies subscription rights as 
compensation against effects of dilution in the amount  in which they would be 
entitled to such rights upon exercising  such conversion or option rights  or 
fulfilling any conversion obligations.
The notional pro rata amount in the capital stock attributable, in aggregate, to shares to 
be issued or granted under bonds  that are issued based on this authorization  under 
exclusion of the subscription  right must not exceed EUR 72,664,519 (nominal). When  
calculating the aforementioned capital limit, the portion of the capital stock  has to be 
taken into account  that is attributable to the new shares that are issued during the term 
- Convenience Translation – only  the German version is binding –
Annex 13.3 to the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement
6of this authorization under  exclusion  of the subscription right, or that are to be issued 
to fulfil conversion or option rights or conversion obligations under bonds, provided 
that the Bonds have been issued during the term of this authorization under exclusion 
of the shareholders' subscription right. 
The supervisory board is authorized to amend  § 4 para. 1, para 2 sentence 1 and para.  6 
of the articles of association of the company  in accordance  with the respective use of 
Conditional Capital  2020. This applies accordingly if, after the expiration  of the 
authorization period, the authorization to issue convertible bonds/warrant  bonds has not 
been used as well as if, after all deadlines for exercising  conversion rights/warrants have 
expired, Conditional  Capital 2020 has not or not fully been used.

2Preamble
0.1 Siemens AG with its registered offices in Berlin and Munich  is registered with the 
register of companies (Handelsregister) of the district court (Amtsgericht) of 
Charlottenburg under registration number  HRB 12300 B and with the register of 
companies of the district court  of Munich under registration number HRB 6684. 
Siemens AG holds all shares in SBI GmbH with its registered office in Munich,  
registered with the register  of companies  of the district court of Munich under registration  
number HRB 139644. Further, Siemens  AG currently  still holds all shares in Siemens 
Energy AG with its registered office in Munich, registered with the register  of companies 
of the district  court of Munich under registration number HRB  252581. The capital  stock  
of Siemens Energy  AG at the time of conclusion  of this Deconsolidation Agreement 
amounts to EUR 100,000,  divided into 100,000 no-par-value shares (registered shares 
(Namensaktien )).
0.2 Siemens AG intends to bundle  the worldwide Gas & Power operations of the Siemens 
group that are to be separated and the shares held by the Siemens group in the amount  of 
approximately 67 % in Siemens Gamesa Renewable  Energy, S.A. (together, the 
"Siemens Energy Business ") in Siemens Energy AG. Going forward, Siemens 
Energy AG shall be managed as an entity that is legally and organizationally  independent 
of Siemens AG; its shares  shall be admitted  to trading  at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. 
Siemens AG intends to retain a direct minority shareholding  and an indirect minority 
shareholding held via SBI GmbH in the amount of initially 45 % of the future shares in 
Siemens Energy AG. The remaining  shares in Siemens Energy AG are to be transferred 
to the Siemens shareholders  by way of a spin-off (Abspaltung) of the partnership interests 
in Siemens  Gas and Power GmbH & Co. KG and its general partner  (Komplementärin) –
being the company to which the Siemens Energy Business was transferred  beforehand  – 
to Siemens  Energy  AG. The spin-off will take effect upon its registration with the 
registers of companies of Siemens AG at the district court  of Charlottenburg and at the 
district court  of Munich (the day of the later of these  two registrations is hereinafter 
referred to as the "Closing  Date "). In the context of the spin-off, shares in Siemens 
Energy AG in the amount of about  9.9 % of the capital stock  out of the directly and 
indirectly retained shareholding  of 45 % of the future  shares held by Siemens AG shall be 
transferred to  Siemens Pension-Trust e.V.
0.3 After the Closing  Date and transfer  of shares to Siemens  Pension-Trust e.V., the shares in 
Siemens Energy AG will be  held as follows: 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  19 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
 
3 Siemens AG: 167,744,527 shares  (corresponding  to approximately 23.08 % of the 
capital stock); 
 SBI GmbH: 87,307,936  shares (corresponding to approximately 12.02 % of the 
capital stock); 
 Siemens Pension-Trust e.V.: 71,937,874 shares (corresponding to 9.9 % of the 
capital stock);
 Shareholders of Siemens  AG: the remaining  399,654,856 shares (corresponding to 
55 % of the capital stock). 
0.4 Following  the Closing Date  and completion of status  proceedings (Statusverfahren) 
(pursuant to Sections 97 et seqq.  of the German Stock  Corporation  Act (Aktiengesetz, 
"AktG")), Siemens Energy AG will constitute an equally co-determined supervisory 
board (paritätisch mitbestimmter Aufsichtsrat) in accordance with the provisions of the 
German Co-Determination  Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz, "MitbestG"). The supervisory 
board will have 20 members  (Section 7 (1) sentence 1 no. 3 MitbestG), one half of which  
is to be elected as shareholder representatives by the shareholders' meeting of Siemens 
Energy AG. 
0.5 The Siemens Energy Business shall be managed by Siemens Energy  AG autonomously  
and independently of Siemens AG. Siemens AG does not intend  to exert, directly  or 
indirectly, controlling influence on Siemens Energy  AG. As a consequence, Siemens 
Energy AG will be able to evolve  as an autonomous and independent company which 
should have – in the opinion of the members of the managing  boards of Siemens  AG and 
Siemens Energy  AG – a positive effect  on the market valuation of the shares of 
Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG. It is intended that, after the spin-off has taken 
effect, the Siemens Energy  Business will no longer be fully consolidated  in 
Siemens AG's consolidated financial statements.
0.6 Given  the fact that there is no majority shareholding within the meaning  of 
Section 16 AktG, it will not be assumed  that Siemens Energy AG is still controlled by 
Siemens AG pursuant to Section 17 (2) AktG after the Closing Date. In the event, which  
cannot be completely  ruled  out, that Siemens AG directly and indirectly,  specifically via 
the shares held by SBI GmbH,  will hold the majority  of the shares entitled to vote and 
represented at future shareholders' meetings of Siemens Energy  AG, Siemens AG and 
SBI GmbH do not  intend to exert controlling influence on Siemens Energy AG.

Annex  19 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
 
40.7 In order to illustrate the entrepreneurial autonomy of Siemens Energy  AG and its 
independence from Siemens  AG,  and to provide from the outset for legal certainty  
irrespective of future shareholder  presence at shareholders' meetings of Siemens 
Energy AG, the Parties intend to ensure this by entering into a contractual agreement on 
the non-exercise of control. 
Now, therefore,  the Parties agree  as follows:
§ 1
General Restrictions  on the Exercise of Voting Rights 
1.1 Siemens AG and SBI GmbH undertake  to Siemens Energy  AG, with regard to the 
resolutions at shareholders' meetings of Siemens Energy AG on 
a) the appointment and removal  of the supervisory board members;
b) management measures pursuant to Section 83, Section 111 (4) sentences 3 to 5, 
Sections 111b (4), 119 (2) or 179a AktG;
c) the discharge of the members of the managing and supervisory boards 
(Entlastung) and a vote of no confidence (Vertrauensentzug) in respect of 
managing board  members;
d) the remuneration of the supervisory  board members (Section 113 (3) AktG) and 
the remuneration system for the managing  board members  (Section 120a  AktG) 
including a possible reduction of the remuneration under  Section 87 (4) AktG; and 
e) the approval of the annual financial  statements if the shareholders' meeting 
resolves on such approval (Section  173 AktG),
to exercise their voting rights attached to their shares of Siemens Energy AG, subject to 
the provisions  on the Special Supervisory Board Member in § 3 of this Deconsolidation 
Agreement, only up to the maximum number of votes of Siemens AG (as defined in § 1.3 
of this Deconsolidation Agreement).
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  19 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
 
51.2 Prior to a resolution pursuant to § 1.1 of this Deconsolidation Agreement, the number of 
votes held by the other  shareholders present  or represented at the relevant  shareholders' 
meeting is to be determined  (hereinafter the "Other Shareholders’ Voting  Presence ") 
based on the last presence of the shares  entitled to vote at the shareholders'  meeting 
which is determined  prior to the vote, including shares for which the voting rights were  
cast by postal vote (the "Presence "). For this purpose, Siemens AG's shares in Siemens 
Energy AG and the shares in Siemens  Energy  AG attributable to Siemens AG shall be 
deducted from the Presence. All present  shares  in Siemens Energy AG held by 
Siemens AG or any affiliated  company of Siemens AG that is a Party to this Agreement 
shall be deemed "Siemens  AG's  Shares". The following present shares  in Siemens 
Energy AG shall be  deemed " Shares Attributable  to Siemens AG" : 
a) shares held by companies that are controlled by Siemens AG within the meaning 
of Section 17 AktG or held by subsidiaries as defined  in the International  
Financial Reporting  Standard IFRS 10 (Appendix  A) (hereinafter "IFRS 10") to 
the extent that they are not deemed to be Siemens AG's Shares,
b) shares held by Siemens Pension-Trust e.V.  or other pension schemes, pension 
funds, support funds or investment  funds that serve  the purpose of providing 
company pension or implementing  remuneration  and participation  programs for 
employees of Siemens AG and/or its affiliated companies (Sections 15 et seqq. 
AktG),
c) shares held by members of the managing board of Siemens AG or members of 
SBI GmbH's board  of managing  directors,  and
d) shares in respect of which the voting right is exercised at Siemens Energy AG’s 
shareholders' meeting  by members of the managing  board of Siemens AG or 
members of  SBI GmbH's board  of managing directors. 
1.3 The voting rights attached  to Siemens AG's  Shares  may be exercised by Siemens AG and 
SBI GmbH for resolutions pursuant to § 1.1 of this Deconsolidation  Agreement only for 
up to the "Maximum Number of Siemens AG's  Voting  Rights".  The Maximum 
Number of Siemens AG's  Voting Rights shall be determined by deducting  from the Other 
Shareholders’ Voting Presence (i) votes corresponding to 10 % of the Other 
Shareholders’ Voting Presence and (ii) votes attached  to present shares that are deemed  
Shares Attributable to Siemens AG.

6§ 2
Maximum Number of Representatives of Siemens AG on 
the Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy AG
2.1 Siemens AG and SBI GmbH undertake to Siemens Energy AG to ensure that at all times 
no more than three supervisory board  members depending on Siemens AG are members 
of Siemens Energy  AG’s supervisory board  representing  the shareholders.
2.2 The following  persons  shall  be deemed persons "Depending on Siemens AG"  
a) persons who are or have  been  in the past two (2) years, counting  as from the date 
of the respective  shareholders' meeting,  members of the managing  board of 
Siemens AG, management  of SBI GmbH or the managing body of any other 
subsidiary within the meaning of IFRS 10 (Appendix A)  or of an affiliated  
company of Siemens AG within the meaning of Sections  15 et seqq. AktG, of an 
associate (as defined in no. 3 of the international accounting  standards IAS 28 or 
the respective  successor provision – hereinafter "IAS 28") of Siemens AG or of a 
joint venture (as  defined  in IAS 28 no. 3)  of Siemens AG;
b) persons who are or have  been  in the past two (2) years, counting  as from the date 
of the respective  shareholders'  meeting,  in an employment relationship with 
Siemens AG or an affiliated  company (pursuant to Sections 15 et seqq.  AktG) of 
Siemens AG; 
c) persons who are relatives (as defined in Section 15 of the German  Fiscal Code 
(Abgabenordnung , "AO"))  of a current  managing board  member of Siemens AG;  
or
d) persons who, based on a decision adopted  by the supervisory board of Siemens 
Energy AG in accordance with its duties, cannot  be considered as independent, 
because 
(i)they may currently have personal or business relations with Siemens AG, or 
an affiliated  company of Siemens AG, that may cause  a substantial and not 
merely temporary  conflict of interests  (within the meaning  of Section  C.9 of 
the 2020 German  Corporate  Governance  Code),
(ii)the supervisory board of Siemens Energy AG therefore believes that the 
supervisory board  member  (or a candidate  for membership on the supervisory 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  19 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
 
7board) is not independent (within the meaning  of the 2020 German Corporate 
Governance Code) of Siemens AG; and
(iii) the supervisory board of Siemens Energy AG has made this view  public in an 
election proposal  (Wahlvorschlag), in a declaration of conformity 
(Entsprechenserklärung) with the German Corporate Governance Code or in 
comparable publications.
2.3 In order  to achieve  the aim specified in § 2.1 of this Deconsolidation Agreement, 
Siemens AG and SBI GmbH will, in particular,
a) in the event of an election  of the supervisory  board, not vote for candidates that 
are Depending on Siemens AG to the extent that, as a consequence of their 
election, more  than three  shareholder representatives  on the supervisory board  of 
Siemens Energy  AG would  be Depending  on Siemens  AG; 
b) not submit  to the shareholders' meeting  of Siemens Energy AG election  proposals 
of their own for elections to the supervisory board and will ensure  that affiliated 
companies of Siemens AG  (Sections 15 et seqq.  AktG)  do not submit election  
proposals to the extent that, assuming that these election proposals and 
furthermore the election proposals of the supervisory board  of Siemens 
Energy AG are accepted,  as a consequence  and following their election,  there 
would be more than three  shareholder representatives  on the supervisory board of 
Siemens Energy  AG who are Depending on Siemens AG; 
c) in the event of a court appointment of supervisory board members pursuant  to 
Section 104 AktG, not exercise  the shareholders’  rights such that, as a result of the 
court appointment,  there  will be more than three shareholder representatives on 
the supervisory board of Siemens Energy AG who are Depending on 
Siemens AG; and
d) exert influence  on members  of management bodies or on employees of 
Siemens AG or its affiliated  companies,  e.g. by refusing a required  approval for 
the assumption of a secondary  function, such that these members  will not accept a 
mandate as supervisory board  member if otherwise  there would be more than 
three shareholder  representatives on the supervisory  board  who are Depending on 
Siemens AG.

8§ 3
Restrictions on the Exercise of Voting rights for the 
Special Supervisory Board Member  
3.1 Siemens AG and SBI GmbH undertake  to Siemens  Energy AG to exercise the voting 
right attached to Siemens AG's  Shares (as defined  in § 1.2 of this Deconsolidation 
Agreement) in Siemens Energy  AG for the election,  re-election  and vote on the removal  
of a supervisory board member and, where applicable, a substitute  member  of that 
supervisory board  member (hereinafter "Special  Supervisory Board Member") only in 
compliance with the following restriction. The voting  right attached to Siemens AG's  
Shares may be exercised for the passing of resolutions pursuant to sentence 1 above for 
not more than the "Reduced  Maximum  Number  of Voting  Rights of Siemens AG." 
The Reduced Maximum Number of Voting Rights of Siemens AG is to be determined by 
deducting from the Other Shareholders’  Voting Presence  (i) votes corresponding to 40 % 
of the Other  Shareholders’  Voting Presence and (ii) votes  attached to shares that are 
present and  that are  deemed to be  Shares Attributable to  Siemens AG.
3.2 The Special Supervisory Board Member  and, where applicable, a substitute  member 
appointed for that supervisory board  member must  not be a person Depending on 
Siemens AG (within the meaning of § 2.2 of this Deconsolidation Agreement). 
3.3 Siemens Energy AG’s supervisory  board  shall inform Siemens AG in due time before  the 
first shareholders' meeting  after the Closing Date  where  shareholder representatives are to 
be elected for the supervisory board,  of the name of the candidate from the supervisory 
board’s election proposal who is to be elected  as Special Supervisory Board Member. 
This applies mutatis mutandis if, at a later point  in time, the Special Supervisory Board  
Member elected and, where applicable,  his/her (substitute  as) successor in office, leaves 
office, is no longer available for re-election or has by that time become  a person 
Depending on Siemens AG.  
3.4 To the extent that Siemens Energy  AG’s supervisory board has not designated  the Special  
Supervisory Board Member  to Siemens AG and if Siemens Energy AG’s supervisory  
board does not inform Siemens AG of the name  of the Special Supervisory Board 
Member by the twenty-first (21st) day before  the start of the relevant  shareholders' 
meeting at which a supervisory board election is to be held, or if the candidate whose 
name has been notified is a person Depending on Siemens AG, that candidate on the 
supervisory board’s election proposal who is not Depending on Siemens AG and who is 
the most  senior member (in age) will be deemed to be the Special Supervisory Board 
Member.

9§ 4
Share Transfer  to Affiliated Companies
4.1 The free transferability of the shares  held by Siemens AG and SBI GmbH  is not restricted 
by this agreement.  This also applies  to the transfer of shares to other companies that are 
affiliated companies of Siemens AG (Sections 15 et seqq. AktG). 
4.2 If, as a result of any such transfer, an affiliated company  acquires a direct participation of 
at least 10 %  of the capital stock of Siemens  Energy  AG, any such transfer is only 
permissible if that affiliated  company accedes to this Deconsolidation Agreement 
assuming the obligations incumbent  upon Siemens AG  and SBI GmbH. For accession to 
this Deconsolidation Agreement,  the affiliated  company has to send an accession 
declaration to Siemens Energy  AG;  separate acceptance  by the other Parties to this 
Deconsolidation Agreement  is not required for accession to this Deconsolidation 
Agreement. Accession of the Siemens Pension-Trust  e.V.  to this Deconsolidation  
Agreement pursuant to sentence 1 above  is not required.
4.3 Furthermore, a transfer of shares  to other affiliated companies of Siemens  AG 
(Sections 15 et seqq. AktG)  is only permissible if, as a result of the transfer, the Shares 
Attributable to Siemens AG (as defined  in § 1.2 of this Deconsolidation Agreement) do 
not account for more than 15 % of the issued shares of Siemens Energy AG. Affiliated 
companies of Siemens AG  that hold shares  in Siemens Energy AG may,  with the 
approval of Siemens AG, accede to this Deconsolidation  Agreement at any time in 
accordance with § 4.2 sentence 2 of this Deconsolidation Agreement.
4.4 Siemens AG undertakes to ensure that its affiliated companies  (Sections 15 et seqq. 
AktG) including SBI GmbH do not exercise  their rights  attached  to the shares in Siemens 
Energy AG to the extent that the non-exercise of rights is required for Siemens AG to 
fulfil its obligations towards Siemens Energy AG under  this Agreement.
§ 5
Shareholders’ Request for Compliance
Besides Siemens Energy AG, other shareholders  of Siemens Energy  AG whose shares 
taken together represent  an amount in the capital stock  of at least EUR 100,000 may 
request compliance with the obligations under  this Deconsolidation Agreement.

10§ 6
Applicability and Term
6.1 This Agreement will take effect  as of the Closing Date  and is concluded  for a term until 
the end of the fifth annual shareholders'  meeting after the shareholders'  meeting of 
Siemens Energy  AG following  the Closing Date at which an election of shareholder 
representatives for Siemens  Energy AG’s supervisory  board  was on the agenda. Prior to 
the end of that term, no ordinary termination (ordentliche  Kündigung) is possible. 
Thereafter, this Deconsolidation  Agreement will be renewed for the period leading up to 
the end of the fifth annual  shareholders'  meeting following  thereafter, unless terminated 
by a Party by giving at least  three months’ notice prior  to its expiry.
6.2 The right to terminate  this Agreement for good cause  (Kündigung  aus wichtigem Grund) 
remains unaffected.  A sale of shares in Siemens Energy  AG by Siemens AG or affiliated  
companies (Sections 15 et seqq. AktG) of Siemens AG (including SBI GmbH) that 
results in Siemens  AG holding, directly or indirectly, taking  into account  the shares 
attributable to it pursuant  to Section  16 (4) AktG  ("Participation"),  less than 15 % of the 
shares in Siemens Energy AG shall  constitute an extraordinary cause for terminating this 
Deconsolidation Agreement; in this case,  each Party may terminate this Deconsolidation 
Agreement in writing at any time without notice (fristlos kündigen), until the 
Participation is again above 15 %.
6.3 Only the Parties have a right  to terminate  or cancel this Deconsolidation Agreement; the 
exercise of this right is not subject to the consent of the other shareholders of Siemens  
Energy AG.
§ 7
Termination of this Deconsolidation Agreement
7.1 The termination of this Deconsolidation  Agreement could  result in Siemens AG again 
gaining control or competitively significant  influence as defined under merger control 
law over Siemens Energy AG with the consequence that clearance requirements under  
merger control  law are triggered thereby. The termination  of this Deconsolidation 
Agreement is therefore subject  to the condition precedent that all regulations under  
merger control law applicable  in the relevant  jurisdictions  have been complied with so 
that the termination of this Deconsolidation Agreement can be implemented  under the 
merger control regulations  applicable in each case.  This is the case, in particular,  if 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  19 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
 
11a) the competent competition authority (Kartellbehörde) has granted clearance as

Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
Preamble
(A) The following Group Separation  Agreement is an annex to the Spin-off and Transfer 
Agreement between  Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG entered into on the date hereof. 
Defined terms  used in the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement  have the same meaning when 
used in this Group Separation Agreement,  unless otherwise defined herein.  
(B) Upon the spin-off taking effect,  55 % of the respective participation  in each Siemens  
Energy KG and General Partner GmbH will be transferred to Siemens Energy AG in 
accordance with the provisions  of the German  Transformation Act (Umwandlungsgesetz ). 
Prior to that, the remaining 45 % of the respective participation  in each Siemens Energy  KG 
and in General Partner GmbH will be transferred by Siemens AG and SBI GmbH to Siemens 
Energy AG as contributions in kind pursuant to the Contribution Agreement in exchange for 
the granting of shares. 
(C) Upon the spin-off taking effect,  the shareholders of Siemens AG will hold 55 % in total of 
the capital stock  of Siemens Energy AG. The remaining 45 % of Siemens Energy AG's 
capital stock will be held in part directly  by Siemens AG and in part indirectly via 
SBI GmbH. All shares of Siemens Energy  AG will be admitted to trading  on the Regulated 
Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and also on the sub-segment of the Regulated 
Market of the Frankfurt  Stock Exchange with additional post-admission obligations (Prime 
Standard).
(D) The worldwide  operations  of Gas and Power of the Siemens Group that are to be separated 
and the shares held by the Siemens Group in Siemens  Gamesa  Renewable  Energy,  S.A. 
(together, the "Siemens Energy Business") have  been or will be legally  and organizationally 
consolidated in Siemens Energy  KG on the basis of agreements that have already been 
entered into (together, the "Establishment Agreements",  individually the "Establishment 
Agreement").
(E) Upon the spin-off  taking effect, Siemens Energy AG and the companies  directly or indirectly 
transferred to it will leave the Siemens Group.  Siemens  Energy  AG will conduct the Siemens 
Energy Business  then held by it such that it is legally and organizationally  independent of 
Siemens AG.
(F) Although Siemens  AG will hold a (direct and indirect) participation of 45 % in Siemens 
Energy AG, based on the Deconsolidation  Agreement that has been entered  into, Siemens 
Energy AG will no longer be a dependent company of Siemens AG within the meaning of 
Section 17 AktG upon the spin-off  taking  effect. Siemens AG will not exert controlling  
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
influence on Siemens Energy  AG. Upon the spin-off taking  effect, the Siemens Energy 
Business will no longer be fully consolidated but the participation in Siemens Energy AG 
will be included  at equity in the consolidated financial statements  of Siemens AG.
(G) Upon the spin-off  taking effect, Siemens  Energy AG as the group parent company together  
with Siemens Energy   KG, which will then be held by Siemens  Energy  AG as sole 
shareholder, and its subsidiaries  will form a group of their own. Upon the spin-off taking 
effect, Siemens AG as the group parent company  will continue to conduct the remaining 
Siemens business. 
(H) With this Group  Separation Agreement, the Parties wish  to regulate their legal relationships 
for the time as of the spin-off taking effect  and the resulting separation of Siemens Energy  
AG and its group  companies from the Siemens Group. Unless expressly provided for 
otherwise in this Group  Separation Agreement, group companies of a Party  are companies  
(i) that,  upon the spin-off taking effect, are that Party's group companies within the meaning 
of Section  18 AktG or (ii) that become that Party's group companies after the spin-off taking 
effect based on Establishment  Agreements entered  into prior to  the spin-off taking  effect.
Now, therefore,  the Parties agree  as follows: 
§ 1
Establishment  of the  Siemens Energy Business
1.1 On the basis of the Establishment Agreements, the Siemens Energy  Business has been  or 
will be legally  and organizationally  bundled under the umbrella of Siemens  Energy KG. It 
is the common understanding  of the Parties that the allocation of companies, activities, 
assets, liabilities and risks  to the Siemens Energy Business made under and in connection 
with the Establishment Agreements  is conclusive and binding. This does not prejudice 
other provisions set forth in  the Establishment  Agreements.
1.2 Each Party will procure that each of its group  companies that is party to an Establishment 
Agreement shall perform such Establishment  Agreement in accordance with the respective 
agreements made  therein,  unless otherwise provided for in this Group Separation 
Agreement.
1.3 The provisions set forth in this Group  Separation Agreement do not modify the provisions 
set forth in the individual Establishment  Agreements.  The Parties  agree that in the event 
that a provision agreed  in this Group Separation  Agreement  substantially conflicts with an 
agreement made  in an Establishment Agreement, the agreement made in the Establishment 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
Agreement shall take precedence (principle of precedence), unless a precedence of the 
provisions of the Group Separation Agreement is expressly agreed in this Group  Separation 
Agreement (deviation from the principle  of precedence).  In such a case, each Party  shall 
ensure that its respective group company  which is a party to the respective Establishment 
Agreement shall observe and appropriately implement this. 
1.4 On the basis of so-called agency  agreements,  certain operations are conducted  on behalf of 
group companies of Siemens Energy  AG by the following group companies of 
Siemens AG: (i) Siemens Spa (Algeria),  (ii) Siemens  A.E., Electrotechnical Projects and 
Products (Greece),  (iii) Siemens  Ltd. (India), (iv) P.T.  Siemens Indonesia (Indonesia) and 
(v) Siemens Pakistan Engineering  Co. Ltd. (Pakistan).  Exclusively  the provisions set forth 
in the agency agreements apply to those operations. The provisions set forth in this Group 
Separation Agreement  do not apply to these  operations.  
§ 2 
Liability
2.1 To the extent that claims are asserted  against  Siemens AG or any of its group  companies  
on the basis of a statutory liability  or non-contractual liability imposed under common  law 
for liabilities, obligations or contingent  liabilities  incurred or established  prior to the spin-
off taking effect  that, based  on their origin or purpose, are attributable  to the Siemens 
Energy Business,  Siemens Energy AG must indemnify  Siemens AG or the group  company 
concerned from the respective  liability.
2.2 To the extent that claims  are asserted against Siemens Energy  AG or any of its group 
companies on the basis of a statutory liability  or non-contractual liability  imposed under 
common law for liabilities, obligations or contingent liabilities incurred or established  prior 
to the spin-off taking effect  that, based  on their origin or purpose, are attributable to the 
remaining Siemens business, Siemens AG must indemnify Siemens Energy AG or the 
group company  concerned from  the respective liability.
§ 3
Admission to Stock Exchange Trading, Insurance, Allocation of Prospectus Liability
3.1 It has been agreed in the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement that all shares of Siemens 
Energy AG are to be admitted to trading on the Regulated  Market of the Frankfurt Stock  
Exchange and also on the sub-segment of the Regulated  Market of the Frankfurt Stock  
Exchange with additional  post-admission  obligations  (Prime Standard)  immediately  after 
the spin-off taking  effect. Prior to that, for the purpose of admission to stock  exchange 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
trading, Siemens  Energy AG will, among other  things, prepare and publish (or otherwise 
make available  to investors in the context of the admission to stock exchange trading) a 
securities prospectus to be approved  by the German Federal Financial  Supervisory 
Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht)  and further  marketing 
materials and other documents. The Parties intend to take out market-standard insurance 
for the risks  typically associated with an admission to stock exchange trading  in connection 
with the listing of the  shares of Siemens Energy AG.
3.2 In the event that no insurance is taken out for the risks typically  associated with an 
admission to stock exchange  trading or if and to the extent that, despite such insurance, a 
Party does not in fact obtain compensation, all damage  in connection with the 
implementation of the admission  to stock  exchange  trading and other financial losses  
incurred because the securities  prospectus and/or  the further marketing materials  and other 
documents actually or allegedly contain  information that is incorrect, incomplete or 
otherwise misleading  (so-called prospectus  liability)  will be divided between Siemens AG 
and Siemens Energy  AG at a ratio  of 45 % and  55 %. 
This distribution applies, in particular, to the liability under warranty and indemnity  
obligations of Siemens Energy AG vis-à-vis  the banks accompanying the transaction. It 
also applies to costs and expenses (including  charges) incurred by any Party for purposes 
of examining, defending  against or settling prospectus liability (including filing counter-
claims and counter-actions and asserting claims  against third parties) if and to the extent 
that these costs and expenses are necessary or adequate from the perspective of a prudent 
and conscientious manager whose  company  would have to bear such costs and expenses. 
Accordingly, the Parties will mutually indemnify  one another according to the distribution 
described above. Section  254 of the German  Civil Code  (Bürgerliches  Gesetzbuch , 
"BGB ") and all comparable  provisions and principles of law of any kind whatsoever shall 
not apply in the relationship  between the Parties and any defense or objection  raised by any 
Party in this regard against  the other Party is hereby expressly excluded.
§ 4
Accounting
4.1 In its accounting, i.e. in the consolidated annual financial  statements and in the half-year 
and quarterly financial reporting, Siemens  AG will, as of the spin-off taking effect, 
recognize the (direct and indirect) participation in Siemens Energy AG, which will 
continue to be held by it, in its statements of financial position as a participation in 
accordance with the equity  method  (IAS 28). Siemens AG will comply with corresponding 
disclosure obligations, including those pursuant to IFRS  12. To facilitate this, Siemens  
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
Energy AG will forward  to Siemens  AG all documents necessary for this and will disclose  
information. In the context of the deconsolidation of the Siemens Energy  Business and the 
first-time application of the equity method following the spin-off taking effect, Siemens 
Energy AG will make available to Siemens AG the necessary documents and information.
4.2 Quarterly reporting of Siemens Energy  AG to Siemens AG ("regular  reporting") will 
correspond in all material aspects  to the balance-sheet  accounting and valuation principles  
and the other accounting principles  of Siemens  AG as applicable  from time to time. 
Therefore, Siemens AG will make available  to Siemens Energy  AG at least once  per year 
the current key accounting principles  of Siemens AG and will additionally support Siemens 
Energy AG in all other respects with a view to the transmission of the necessary documents 
and the disclosure  of the necessary information. Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG will 
establish a procedure  for the exchange  of information  regarding regulatory  changes of the 
applicable accounting standards  and potential changes of accounting principles in order to 
be able to take relevant changes into account as early as possible.
4.3 Furthermore, Siemens Energy AG will make available to Siemens AG all information  that 
Siemens AG reasonably requires  in order to report the expected earnings per share  or, as 
the case may be, substantial  deviations  in the context of its own mandatory  financial  
reporting. Siemens AG will publish  communicated information  that (directly or indirectly) 
allows conclusions as to the earnings situation  of Siemens Energy AG only after the 
publication of the relevant  financial  reports  of Siemens Energy AG or with the prior 
consent of Siemens Energy AG.
4.4 Siemens AG and Siemens  Energy  AG have mutually agreed on the scope and time limits 
of the regular reporting as set out in Annex 4.4. Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG will 
consult with each other regarding  all circumstances  relevant to regular reporting (e.g. an 
intended change in the process  of preparing  financial  statements)  and will adjust the 
contents of Annex 4.4 accordingly in the scope of what  is necessary  and reasonable.  To 
the extent that this is necessary and reasonable, Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG will 
widen the scope  of regular  reporting in Annex 4.4 (e.g. regarding  regular reporting  for 
business transactions after  the date  of a statement of financial  position). 
4.5 Siemens Energy AG and Siemens AG will assist each other in the context of the timely 
response to questions, if any, asked  by the German  Financial Reporting  Enforcement Panel 
(Deutsche  Prüfstelle für Rechnungslegung ) regarding Siemens AG's participation  in 
Siemens Energy  AG. In  this regard, the provisions in § 8.5 apply mutatis  mutandis .
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
4.6 Siemens AG will reimburse Siemens Energy  AG for additional reasonable external costs 
incurred when complying with  the obligations specified in § 4 (e.g. for additional 
actuarial reports  and additional  audit fees) after prior  consultation and  submission of 
written proof. 
4.7 To the extent that Siemens Energy AG reasonably requires information  from Siemens AG 
to comply with disclosure  obligations  in connection with Siemens AG's shareholder status  
(e.g. in the context  of related  party  transactions),  Siemens AG will provide such 
information to Siemens Energy AG. 
4.8 All of the obligations of the Parties under this § 4 are subject  to the condition that the 
disclosure of the information is legally permissible  and that – as regards inside information 
within the meaning of Art. 7 MAR or other applicable  provisions under capital market laws 
– in particular the applicable insider trading  regulations are adhered to.
4.9 The above provisions of this § 4 only apply for as long as the participation  of Siemens AG 
enables it to (directly and indirectly) exert significant influence on Siemens Energy AG 
within the meaning  of IAS 28. As a rule, this is to be assumed  for as long as the (direct and 
indirect) participation of Siemens AG in Siemens  Energy AG's capital stock  amounts in 
total to at least 20 %. If these conditions are no longer fulfilled  and if Siemens AG still 
requires specific information  from  Siemens  Energy AG for its own accounting and 
financial reporting, the Parties,  taking into account the principle  of good faith,  will agree 
in each case  on adequate  and expedient  provisions for disclosing that  information.
§ 5
Tax Indemnifications
5.1 "Taxes" within the meaning  of this Group Separation Agreement shall mean  any German 
and foreign federal, state or local tax, including income, capital gains, value-added,  sales 
or property tax, stamp duty, wage tax, customs and social  security payments  (in each case 
including all ancillary charges,  interest,  penalties, fines or other surcharges  imposed by any 
Tax authority).
5.2 In the course of the bundling of the Siemens Energy Business  in Siemens Energy KG, the 
following contributions within the meaning of Section 24 (1) of the German 
Transformation Tax Act (Umwandlungssteuergesetz , "UmwStG")  were made into 
Siemens Energy  KG: 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
a)effective as of 1 January  2020, Siemens AG contributed a business unit (Teilbetrieb ) in 
exchange for the increase of its partnership interest (Siemens  AG contributed such 
partnership interest  into SBI GmbH consequently);
b)Siemens AG and  Kyros  63 GmbH joined  SBI GmbH as new partners, which is treated 
under Tax law as a new foundation  (Neugründung) of the enlarged Siemens Energy 
KG, into which  the former shareholders contribute their shares; and
c)effective as of 31 March 2020, SBI GmbH contributed its corporate shareholdings 
(Kapitalgesellschaftsbeteiligungen)  each consisting of a participation  of 100 % in 
Power Control GmbH, Trench Germany GmbH and Dresser-Rand  do Brasil, Ltda. as 
business units  in exchange for the  increase of its partnership interest.
Siemens Energy AG undertakes to procure  that Siemens Energy KG recognizes the 
business assets contributed in each case at their book values for Tax purposes pursuant  to 
Section 24 (2) sentence 2 UmwStG and submits the book value application necessary for 
this purpose in each case in due time. If Siemens Energy AG fails to comply with its 
obligation and if Siemens Energy  KG fails to recognize the contributed  business  assets at 
their book  values for Tax purposes  and/or  to submit the book value  application necessary 
for this purpose by the applicable deadline, Siemens Energy AG will pay to Siemens AG 
or, at the option of the latter, to SBI GmbH an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Taxes 
consequently assessed  against  Siemens AG and SBI GmbH and (ii) the  nominal amount 
of the consequently reduced  corporate income Tax loss carryforwards at Siemens  AG and 
SBI GmbH  multiplied by the corporate income Tax rate applicable in the Tax assessment  
period of recognition of the contribution gain, plus solidarity surcharge, and (iii) the 
nominal amount of the consequently reduced trade Tax losses (gewerbesteuerliche  
Fehlbeträge) at Siemens AG and SBI GmbH multiplied  by the average trade Tax rate 
(tarifliche Gewerbesteuerbelastung ) of the relevant company  in each case,  as is to be 
determined taking into account the Tax base amount (Steuermessbetrag), the applicable 
multipliers (Hebesätze) and the applicable Tax breakdown formula  (Zerlegungsmaßstab)  
in the reference  period of recognition  of the contribution gain. In the event of a reduction  
of corporate income Tax loss carryforwards and/or trade Tax losses, however, the 
indemnification obligation pursuant to (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence does not 
apply if and to the extent that the reduced corporate income Tax loss carryforwards and/or 
trade Tax losses, had they not been used for offsetting against  the contribution gain, would 
have been  lost without  being used up to the point  in time when an indemnification 
obligation had arisen (e.g. under Section  8c of the German Corporate Income Tax Act 
(Körperschaftsteuergesetz, "KStG")) or Section  12 (3) sentence 2 UmwStG);  in the event 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
that higher income is subsequently assessed that could have  been used for offsetting against 
(otherwise lost) loss carryforwards or losses prior to their notional loss, the indemnification 
obligation also applies  to these amounts.
5.3 In the course of the legal  separation of the Siemens Energy  Business, SBI GmbH  (as a 
transferring entity)  contributed its partnership interest  in Siemens Energy KG into Siemens 
Energy AG (as the receiving  entity)  in exchange for the granting of shares in Siemens 
Energy AG. The Parties have  contractually  agreed that the contribution is to be effected at 
book value for Tax purposes  pursuant to Section  20 (2) sentence 2 UmwStG.  Accordingly, 
Siemens Energy  AG has undertaken  to recognize  the received business  assets at their book 
values for Tax purposes and to submit the book value application necessary  for this purpose  
by the applicable  deadline. If Siemens Energy AG fails to comply  with any of these 
obligations, Siemens Energy AG will pay to Siemens AG or, at the option of the latter, to 
SBI GmbH an amount equal  to the sum of (i) the Taxes assessed  against  Siemens AG and 
SBI GmbH as a result and (ii) the  nominal amount  of the consequently reduced corporate  
income Tax loss carryforwards at Siemens  AG and SBI GmbH  multiplied by the corporate  
income Tax rate applicable in the Tax assessment  period of recognition of the contribution 
gain, plus solidarity surcharge.  The last sentence  of § 5.2 applies accordingly in this 
respect.
5.4 In the course of the bundling and the legal separation of the Siemens Energy Business, 
shares that are subject  to a blocking period (sperrfristbehaftete  Anteile)  within the meaning 
of Section 22 (1) UmwStG have  been or will be created ("Shares  Subject to a Blocking 
Period")  as follows:
a)those shares granted  to Siemens  AG (as the transferring entity) in SBI GmbH  (as the 
receiving entity) for contributing a  partnership  interest in  Siemens Energy  KG;
b)those shares  granted  to SBI GmbH (as the transferring entity) in Siemens Energy  AG 
(as the receiving entity) for  contributing a partnership interest in  Siemens Energy KG.
Thus, Siemens AG and SBI GmbH each hold Shares Subject to a Blocking  Period  that have 
been or will be created  based on the Tax-neutral  contribution of shares in Siemens Energy 
KG at book values pursuant to Section 20 (2) sentence 2 UmwStG.
5.5 If Siemens  AG, SBI GmbH or Siemens Energy KG were to be taxed for any contribution 
gain I (Einbringungsgewinn I)  in respect of the Shares Subject to a Blocking Period 
pursuant to Section 22 (1) UmwStG, (including  as a consequence of the occurrence  of any 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
alternative realization event (Ersatzrealisationstatbestand) within the meaning of 
Section 22 (1) sentence 6 nos. 1 to 6 UmwStG), the following  applies:
a)To the extent that the contribution gain I has been  caused  by Siemens AG or SBI GmbH 
(e.g. by selling  the Shares Subject to a Blocking Period),  Siemens AG will pay to 
Siemens Energy AG an amount equal to the sum of (i) the trade Tax assessed  against 
Siemens Energy KG as a result and (ii) the nominal amount of the consequently 
reduced trade Tax deficits at Siemens Energy  KG multiplied by the average trade Tax 
rate of Siemens Energy KG, as is to be determined taking into account  the Tax base 
amount, the applicable multipliers and the applicable Tax breakdown  formula in the 
reference period of recognition of the contribution gain.  A payment  claim  for reduced 
trade Tax losses only exists insofar  as the use of such losses  has not been excluded by 
the transfer of the partnership interests  (Mitunternehmeranteile) in Siemens Energy KG 
from Siemens  AG and SBI GmbH to Siemens Energy AG; in all other respects,  the last 
sentence of § 5.2 applies accordingly. The indemnification claim of Siemens 
Energy AG is reduced by the cash value of any potential Tax benefit  that may arise for 
Siemens Energy AG and/or Siemens Energy KG under the step-up approach  pursuant 
to Section 23 (2) UmwStG ("Step-up Benefit "). The cash value of the Step-up Benefit 
is to be calculated  at a flat rate not taking into account the actual facts and the actual 
Tax situation of these companies and is to be deducted as follows: 
The cash value of the Step-up Benefit  to be deducted will be calculated by (i), in 
a first step, determining the Tax burden on the contribution gain I at a flat rate, 
applying the corporate income Tax rate applicable to Siemens Energy AG in the 
accounting year in which the event  triggering  the Taxation of the contribution 
gain occurs, plus solidarity surcharge,  and applying the average trade Tax rate 
applicable to Siemens Energy KG in the reference period in which the event  
triggering the Taxation  of the contribution  gain occurs, as is to be determined 
taking into account the applicable Tax base amount, the applicable  multipliers 
and the applicable Tax breakdown formula,  and (ii), in a second step, by 
discounting the amount of Tax so determined with a discount factor of 2 % p.a. 
applied to 50 % of the amount of Tax over an assumed  general linear  
depreciation period of ten (10) years  starting  with the accounting year in which  
the event triggering  the Taxation of the contribution gain occurs  and to the 
remaining 50 % of the amount of Tax over an assumed general  linear 
depreciation period of eight  (8) years starting  with the second  accounting year 
following the accounting  year in which  the event triggering the Taxation of the 
contribution gain occurs.
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
If and to the extent  that the Step-up Benefit to be deducted exceeds the amount payable 
by Siemens  AG under this § 5.5 a)  without that Step-up  Benefit, Siemens Energy  AG 
will pay to Siemens  AG an amount equal to the difference. As regards this exceeding  
amount, it has to be assumed when calculating the  net present value  of the Step-up  
Benefit to be deducted and the amount payable by Siemens  AG without this Step-up 
Benefit in the event of a sale of Shares  Subject to a Blocking Period irrespective of the 
actual sequence of events that Siemens AG and SBI GmbH  first sold those  Shares 
Subject to a Blocking  Period  in Siemens Energy  AG that, compared to the other Shares  
Subject to a Blocking Period,  include lower or no taxable hidden reserves (stille 
Reserven)  (in respect  of the assets contributed  in exchange for the shares) to the extent  
that Siemens AG or SBI GmbH  can freely dispose of such shares that include lower  or 
no taxable hidden reserves; this does not apply if Siemens  AG and SBI GmbH sell to a 
third party outside the group or for good cause to an affiliated company all shares in 
Siemens Energy  AG in a single economic transaction. If, however, shares  are 
subsequently sold during  the relevant holding period  that include lower taxable  hidden 
reserves compared to the Shares Subject to a Blocking Period  that were previously sold, 
it is to be assumed  for the purpose of determining  the excess amount when calculating 
the net present value of the Step-up Benefit to be deducted and the amount payable by 
Siemens AG without this Step-up Benefit,  that the previously sold Shares Subject to a 
Blocking Period with the higher taxable hidden reserves had only been sold at this later 
time and Siemens Energy AG will pay Siemens AG the excess amount  determined 
accordingly. The Parties  agree  that the order  of the divestitures assumed in accordance 
with the foregoing sentences is not relevant for the determination of the Step-Up 
Benefit to be deducted from any indemnification  claim of Siemens Energy AG pursuant  
to sentences 3 and 4 of § 5.5 a), but only for the amount  of any payment claim  of 
Siemens AG  in respect  of any excess amount  of the Step-Up Benefit.
b)To the extent that contribution gain I has been caused by Siemens Energy AG or 
Siemens Energy  KG, Siemens Energy AG will pay to Siemens AG an amount equal to 
the sum of (i) the corporate income Tax assessed  against  Siemens AG and SBI GmbH  
as a result, plus solidarity surcharge, and (ii) the nominal amount  of the consequently 
reduced corporate income Tax loss carryforwards at Siemens AG and SBI GmbH 
multiplied by the corporate income  Tax rate applicable in the Tax assessment period of 
recognition of the contribution gain, plus solidarity surcharge.  The last sentence  of § 5.2 
applies accordingly in this  respect.
c)For the purposes of the above  letters a) and b), the contribution  gain I shall be deemed  
to have been caused if it is triggered  by conduct  within the meaning of Section 22 (1) 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
sentence 1 or sentence 6 UmwStG of the relevant company, i.e., Siemens AG and SBI 
GmbH in the case of § 5.5 a) or Siemens  Energy AG and Siemens  Energy KG in the 
case of § 5.5 b) above.  The exercise or non-exercise  of shareholder rights of Siemens 
AG or SBI GmbH in their respective  role as shareholder in Siemens  Energy AG (e.g. 
voting rights at the annual general  meeting  or on the supervisory board) are not to be 
deemed relevant conduct in this  sense .
d)To the extent that Siemens Energy AG is obliged  under this § 5.5 to make a payment 
to Siemens AG, 50 % of the amount  so payable will be due for payment  immediately 
and the remaining 50 % will be due and payable twenty-four (24) months after the first 
installment; in the case of § 5.5 b), the second installment shall bear interest at a rate of 
2 % p.a.
5.6 To the extent that any Party or any of its group companies, by an act performed after the 
spin-off taking effect  with retroactive effect  under Tax law, causes  Tax to be imposed on 
the other Party  or that Party's  group  companies or causes  reductions of corporate income 
Tax loss carryforwards  or trade Tax losses, the Party  that (or whose group company) has 
performed the relevant action  will pay to the other Party  or, at its option, to that Party's 
relevant group company, an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Tax assessed  against the 
other Party  and that Party's  group companies  as a result, and (ii) the nominal amount of the 
consequently reduced  corporate  income  Tax loss carryforwards  available to the other Party  
and that Party's group  companies,  multiplied by the corporate income Tax rate applicable 
in the relevant Tax assessment period, plus solidarity surcharge,  and (iii) the nominal 
amount of the consequently  reduced  trade Tax losses at the other Party and that Party's 
group companies,  multiplied by the average trade Tax rate applicable to the relevant 
company, as is to be determined  taking  into account the applicable Tax base amount,  the 
applicable multipliers and the applicable Tax breakdown formula  in the reference  period 
of recognition  of the contribution  gain. Claims under this § 5.6 will only exist if and to the 
extent that the facts  constituting the claim have not already been covered by § 5.2, § 5.3 or 
§ 5.5.
5.7 To the extent that a Party violates its duties to cooperate pursuant to § 6, that Party  will pay 
to the other Party or, at its option, to that Party's group  company concerned, an amount 
equal to the sum of (i) the Taxes assessed  against  the other Party  and that Party's group 
companies as a result and (ii) the  nominal amount of the consequently  reduced corporate 
income Tax loss carryforwards available  to the other Party  and that Party's  group 
companies, multiplied by the corporate income Tax rate applicable in the relevant Tax 
assessment period,  plus solidarity surcharge, and (iii) the nominal amount of the 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
consequently reduced  trade Tax losses available to the other Party and that Party's  group 
companies, multiplied by the average trade Tax rate of the respective  company, as is to be 
determined taking into account the applicable  Tax base amount,  the applicable multipliers 
and the applicable  Tax breakdown formula in the reference period of recognition of the 
contribution gain, whereby in the cases of (ii) and (iii) above, the last sentence of § 5.2 
applies accordingly,  and (iv) the  external  costs incurred by the other Party or its group 
company as a result of the violation, if and to the extent that the amount to be reimbursed 
pursuant to (i) through (iv) has been caused (directly) by the violation  of duties or could 
have been avoided absent the violation  of duties, unless the other Party  demonstrates that 
the corresponding  Tax, the reduction of corporate  income Tax loss carryforwards and/or 
trade Tax losses and/or the relevant  external  costs would  have arisen  even if the relevant 
Party had properly complied with its cooperation duties. In the following cases,  there is the 
refutable presumption that the amount to be reimbursed has been caused (directly) by the 
violation of  duties: (i)  a pro forma Tax return  within the meaning  of § 6.2 (if applicable, 
in conjunction with § 6.3) has not been provided to the other Party  or has been provided 
with such a delay that the other Party  is unable  to take that Tax return into account  in its 
own Tax return,  or any pro forma  Tax return provided is incorrect or incomplete in any 
material respect; (ii) any  Party has acted in any Tax proceedings without obtaining the 
consent of the other  Party  required pursuant to § 6.4; (iii)  violations  of § 6.5. 
5.8 The Party that, under the preceding paragraphs of § 5, is obligated to make  a payment must 
additionally pay to the other  Party or that Party's group company concerned an amount that 
is necessary to put the other  Party or that Party's group company in a position that it will 
receive in total that amount after Taxes that it would have retained without Taxation of its 
claim and/or the payment  made  (gross-up).
5.9 If and to the extent that the reduction of corporate income Tax loss carryforwards and/or 
trade Tax losses is to be reimbursed in principle in accordance with this § 5, the actual 
Taxes that are subsequently  payable because these loss carryforwards and/or Tax losses  
are not available will not have  to be reimbursed additionally.
5.10 Claims  under this § 5 will become due for payment ten (10) business days after receipt of 
a written  notice in which the creditor has informed  the debtor  of the claim and the relevant 
payment amount accompanied by copies of the relevant Tax assessment notice or the 
relevant loss determination notice  (Verlustfeststellungsbescheid) (including those 
documents that demonstrate the grounds and the amount  of the claim  in a verifiable 
manner). Where  the indemnification claim relates to a Tax assessed, it will become due 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
and payable at the earliest three (3) Business Days before  the relevant Tax is due for 
payment to the  relevant Tax authority.  
5.11 Claims  under  this § 5 will become time-barred six (6) months after (and provided that) the 
underlying Tax assessment or loss determination has become formally and materially 
binding and unappealable  (formell und materiell bestandskräftig ) however (i) no earlier 
than after expiry  of six (6) months after the spin-off taking  effect and (ii) no later than eight 
(8) years after the spin-off taking effect. 
5.12 Claims  under  this § 5 must be determined and calculated with a view  to avoiding  an 
economic over- or under-compensation of Taxes, corporate income Tax loss 
carryforwards, trade Tax losses, external  costs or Step-up Benefits due to taking into 
account the same  facts  several times over.
5.13 The provisions  set forth  in § 5 of this Group Separation Agreement take precedence over 
any provisions contradictory in content  in the Establishment Agreements.
§ 6
Cooperation in  Tax  Matters  
6.1 The Parties will cooperate closely as permitted by law in matters relating to Taxes  with the 
aim of reducing the Tax burden for both Parties  and of their respective  group  companies 
and, as the case may be, obtaining  a refund  of Taxes. To the extent legally permissible, the 
Parties shall also procure that their respective group companies cooperate accordingly. 
Such cooperation shall, in particular, include the procurement and making  available of 
proof and evidence  relevant  for matters  of Taxation (e.g. proofs pursuant  to Section  22 (3) 
UmwStG, residency certificates necessary  for claiming treaty relief, certificates necessary 
for claiming a refund or credit of withholding Taxes). Furthermore, the Parties shall, in 
compliance with respective applicable Tax laws, procure  that the required data processing  
is performed (including storage) and allow  access to data relating to the Tax-relevant  
transactions (in particular,  billing statements  prepared  in the name and for the account of 
Siemens AG for  end customers  in the Siemens Energy pre-systems (Vorsystemen)). 
6.2 To the extent that any Tax proceeding of Siemens AG or of any of its group companies  
existing after the spin-off taking effect (Siemens  AG and its group companies "SAG  
Companies" and each an "SAG Company") relates  to the Siemens Energy Business, 
Siemens Energy  AG will provide  Siemens AG with all information relating thereto  for the 
relevant SAG Company to be able to fulfill its obligations under the respective applicable 
Tax laws timely, completely and correctly; this includes  the right of SAG Companies to be 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
granted access to and use electronically stored data at Siemens Energy AG or at any of its 
group companies existing after the spin-off takes  effect (Siemens Energy AG and its group 
companies "SEAG Companies" and each an "SEAG Company"). For that purpose,  
Siemens Energy AG will in particular procure  that, for each relevant Taxable period, pro 
forma Tax returns will be prepared and provided  to Siemens AG. The pro forma  Tax 
returns are to be prepared in compliance  with the respective applicable Tax laws, i.e. as if 
the relevant  Siemens  Company has in the relevant Taxable period generated solely income, 
revenue and/or turnover allocable  to the respective  Siemens Energy Business  ("stand-
alone"-perspective).  The pro forma Tax returns  (together with the underlying documents, 
attachments and calculations) shall be provided  to Siemens  AG for review no later than 
(i) thirty  (30) Business Days prior  to expiration of the filing  period of the return  to be filed 
by the relevant SAG  Company or (ii) in case the filing deadline is less than thirty  (30) 
Business Days, the expiry  of half of the relevant  filing deadline. § 6.2 applies  accordingly 
vice versa, i.e., to the extent  that Tax proceedings of SEAG Companies relate  to the 
business that remains  with the SAG  Companies, Siemens AG shall  cooperate  with Siemens 
Energy AG accordingly.
6.3 To the extent  that, in the course  of the consolidation of the Siemens Energy Business  into 
Siemens Energy  KG and/or of the legal separation of the Siemens Energy Business, 
contracts that are part of the Siemens Energy Business legally remain with Siemens AG or 
with any other  SAG Company,  Siemens Energy AG will provide Siemens AG with all 
information relating thereto  for the relevant SAG Company to be able to fulfill its 
obligations under  the respective  applicable Tax laws timely,  completely and correctly;  
§ 6.2 applies accordingly in this context.  To the extent that Siemens AG has further 
cooperation rights in connection with such agreements on other legal grounds, such rights 
remain unaffected hereby.
6.4 Subject to the preceding § 6.2, the SAG Companies on the one hand and the SEAG 
Companies on the other hand shall each conduct their own Tax proceedings independently 
without the involvement of the other Party. However,  to the extent that a Tax proceeding 
at a SAG Company relate to Taxes  or Tax refunds owed by a SEAG Company  (including 
by way of a secondary liability  or pursuant  to other obligations) or respectively to which 
any SEAG Company is entitled  or conversely  to the extent any Tax proceedings of an 
SEAG Company  relate  to Taxes or Tax refunds owed by a SAG  Company (including  by 
way of a secondary liability or pursuant to other obligations) or respectively to which a 
SAG Company is entitled (e.g. pursuant to a former Tax group between a SAG Company 
and a SEAG Company), the Parties shall cooperate in good faith in respect  of such Tax 
proceedings. For that purpose, the Parties  shall procure  that prior to taking any action in 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
the relevant  Tax proceeding (such as filing Tax returns or an appeal), the agreement of the 
respective other Party  is sought on how to proceed.  If the Parties are unable to reach  an 
agreement, such Party shall  decide that bears (or whose group company bears) more than 
50 % of the relevant  Taxes or are entitled to more  than 50 % of the relevant  Tax refunds. 
If the Tax or Tax refunds are borne by the Parties in equal parts, the Party shall decide that 
is (or whose group company is) formally  the participant of the Tax proceeding.  The Party 
entitled to take the final decision shall reasonably consider the legitimate interests of the 
other Party, taking  into consideration the Tax allocation quota, and shall avoid that the 
reputation or  business interests of the other  Party are materially impaired. 
6.5 To the extent that any domestic or international Tax group or income Tax consolidation 
scheme exists  or existed between any SEAG Company  and any SAG Company in periods  
prior to the spin-off taking effect (Vollzug der Abspaltung), the Parties  will (i) procure that 
such Tax group or income Tax consolidation  scheme  remain effective for these periods,  
(ii) refrain from  taking  any measures that would result  in the non-recognition of such Tax 
group or income Tax consolidation  scheme for these periods,  and (iii) in the event the Tax 
authorities challenge  such Tax group or income  Tax consolidation scheme  (e.g. pursuant 
to section 14 (1) sentence 1 no. 3 sentence  4 KStG take any remedy measures required (e.g. 
the correction  of commercial balance  sheets or the payment of amounts to ensure that the 
correct profits or losses are transferred). The Parties  agree that the cooperation under  this 
§ 6.5 and the respective measures  shall not to result in a reallocation or shift of assets 
between any SAG Company  and any SEAG Company.  To the extent such measures result 
in such a reallocation  or shift of assets, the  Parties  will financially indemnify each other . 
6.6 The internal costs at Siemens AG, Siemens Energy AG, any SAG  Company and/or any 
SEAG Company  that arise  in connection  with the fulfillment of the obligations set forth in 
§ 5 and § 6 of this Group  Separation Agreement  and any costs of their advisors are borne  
by the Parties in each case themselves.  The provisions contained in any of the 
Establishment Agreements  remain unaffected hereby.
6.7 If and to the extent a suspension of payment, a deferral  or other  similar postponement of 
the due date has been granted upon request,  the Party  which initiated the request  for such 
suspension, deferral or other postponement is responsible for any security  to be provided 
in this respect and shall also bear any interest in connection  with such suspension, deferral 
or other  postponement.
6.8 Whenever in § 5 and § 6 a reference is made  to a certain legal entity, this reference  shall, 
for the avoidance  of doubt, always  include  any legal successor of the referred  entity. 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
6.9 Upon written request of Siemens AG, Siemens Energy AG shall procure that an 
internationally acknowledged  accounting  firm is appointed in consultation with 
Siemens AG to carry out the obligations of Siemens Energy AG as set out in this § 6 for 
and on behalf  of Siemens Energy  AG. 
6.10 To the extent they make reference  to § 5, the provisions set forth  in § 6.6 and § 6.8 of this 
Group Separation  Agreement take precedence over any provisions  contradictory in content 
in the Establishment Agreements.
§ 7
Confidentiality  
7.1 Information  that is available to any Party or its group companies  about the other  Party or 
its group  companies due to the joint group affiliation  of the businesses  that exists  until the 
spin-off taking effect  and information that is provided later on the basis of rights  to 
information under  this Group  Separation  Agreement or the Spin-off and Transfer 
Agreement is referred to hereinafter as "Confidential Information ."
7.2 Confidential Information is not information
a)that was or has become known already to the general public, unless this is the result of 
the breach  of any duty of confidentiality  under  this Agreement; or
b)to which any Party  or any of its group  companies was or has been  provided access 
legitimately already through third parties without limitation as regards use and 
disclosure; or
c)that has been developed by any Party or its group companies independently of the other 
Party or  its group companies.
7.3 Each Party is obligated with respect to the other Party  
a)to keep Confidential Information secret  at all times and to disclose no Confidential 
Information to persons outside of their respective groups  without the prior  written 
consent of the other Party or its group company; consent is deemed given if and to the 
extent that a disclosure is  provided for in the respective Establishment Agreements;
b)to prevent the unauthorized disclosure  of, and access of unauthorized third parties to, 
Confidential Information;
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
c)to make  all necessary  arrangements  to preclude a violation of the provisions of the 
General Data Protection Regulation and of the German Federal Data Protection Act 
(Bundesdatenschutzgesetz); and
d)to inform the other Party without undue delay if it becomes  aware that Confidential 
Information has  been disclosed to any third party without authorization.
The standard for the duty of care pursuant to § 7.3 letter  b) of this Group  Separation 
Agreement is deemed  to be the arrangements  that the other Party  in each case makes to 
protect its  own confidential information.
The disclosure to group companies is permissible only if there is an objectively  justifying  
reason for such disclosure. The disclosure  to advisors or auditors who are under an 
obligation of confidentiality by operation of law or pursuant to German professional law 
(Berufsrecht)  is permissible. 
7.4 Each Party will ensure  that its group companies comply with the foregoing  obligations of 
§ 7.
If any Party  or any of its group companies  is obligated to make  a disclosure by law, on the 
basis of any statutory provision,  any stock exchange rule, any other regulatory provision 
or any contractual obligation agreed  prior to this Group Separation  Agreement  taking effect 
or if any public authority requests  a disclosure  be made in a manner that is not obviously 
illegal, the Party or the group company may disclose Confidential Information to the 
authorized persons to that  extent.
7.5 Group companies  of a Party within the meaning of this § 7 are also companies  that become  
group companies  of that Party within the meaning of Section 18 AktG after the spin-off 
taking effect.
7.6 The provisions of this § 7 take precedence over any provisions contradictory in content in 
the Establishment  Agreements.
§ 8
Information  Sharing, Rights to Documents  and Cooperation Duties  
8.1 Siemens AG and Siemens Energy AG intend following the spin-off  taking effect  to share 
information to the extent legally  permissible. Information may be disclosed to any Party  
only to the extent  that this is legally  permissible  and is in line with the corporate  interests 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
of the Party disclosing  the information. Any disclosure of information  by any Party requires  
a prior request for information by the other Party that must  indicate  the specific purpose of 
the information being requested. The request  for information is to be reviewed in exercise 
of due discretion. If the review concludes  that the aforementioned  requirements for a 
disclosure of information are not met or that the information being requested should not be 
disclosed in exercise of due discretion, this conclusion is to be shared  with the other Party.
8.2 Siemens Energy AG and its group companies will receive all business  records related or 
attributable to the Siemens Energy  Business pursuant  to each of the Establishment 
Agreements entered into. Siemens Energy  AG and its group companies will also receive 
all deeds necessary  to assert  the rights transferred to it in connection with the establishment 
of the Siemens Energy  Business, the Contribution Agreement  or the Spin-off and Transfer 
Agreement in each case.  Siemens Energy  AG and its group companies  will maintain the 
books and other  records for the statutory retention periods  and ensure that Siemens AG and 
its group companies  can inspect  and, to the extent they are not already available, photocopy 
these business  records to the extent  that there  is a legitimate interest in such records.  There 
is such a legitimate interest  if a document relates  to the time of joint affiliation in the 
Siemens Group until the spin-off  taking effect.
8.3 All business records related or attributable to the remaining Siemens business  remain  with 
Siemens AG and its group companies  after the spin-off taking effect. All deeds necessary 
to assert the rights  remaining with the remaining  Siemens business  remain with Siemens  
AG and its group companies. Siemens AG and its group companies will maintain  the books  
and other records for the statutory  retention periods and ensure that Siemens Energy AG 
and its group  companies can inspect and, to the extent they are not already available,  
photocopy these  business records to the extent that there  is a legitimate interest in such 
records.
8.4 After the statutory  retention  periods expire,  each Party  and its group companies may 
destroy business records, writings, books  and other notes  relating to the time of joint 
affiliation in the Siemens  Group  until the spin-off  taking  effect  relevant to the other Party.  
If and to the extent that provisions  have already been stipulated  with respect to records 
relating to guarantees  provided by Siemens AG, such records remain unaffected by the 
foregoing provision.
8.5 To the extent legally  permissible, the Parties will assist each other in compliance issues, 
administrative proceedings and legal  disputes that relate to (inter alia) the fields of 
operation of the other  Party.  In particular, to the extent legally permissible, the Parties will 
- Convenience Translation – only the German version  is binding –
Annex  20 to  the Spin-off and Transfer  Agreement
provide each other with any and all information and documents necessary or expedient for 
the handling of compliance issues and for the fulfillment of Tax or other  administrative 
requirements or for the production of evidence  to the Tax authorities, other public  
authorities or the courts, and will each endeavor that reasonable assistance is provided by 
their respective employees. All powers of representation in respect of courts and public 
authorities remain unaffected. § 6 contains  exhaustive provisions with regard  to Tax 
matters (in particular, Tax proceedings  and legal  disputes and external Tax audits).
8.6 The Parties will agree on appropriate  provisions for the distribution of any costs that arise  
in connection  with the  fulfillment of the  provisions set  forth in  § 8.
8.7 The provisions of this § 8 take precedence over any provisions contradictory in content in 
the Establishment  Agreements.  
§ 9
Assertion and Fulfillment of Claims
9.1 This Group Separation Agreement  entitles and obligates exclusively  the Parties. Claims  
and obligations under  this Group Separation  Agreement must be asserted  and fulfilled 
exclusively between the Parties.  However,  each Party may demand  from the other Party 
regarding its claims  under  this Group Separation Agreement  for performance to be 
rendered to any group company  designated  and authorized by it to accept  performance. 
Each Party  may also employ  any of its group companies as assistants in performance  
(Erfüllungsgehilfen) to fulfill  its obligations under this Agreement.
9.2 Each Party will endeavor and ensure  that it and its group companies comply with and/or 
fulfill the provisions of this Group Separation Agreement and, in particular, do not assert 
any claims contrary to the provisions of this Group Separation Agreement against the other 
Party and its group companies.  Each Party will also endeavor and ensure  that it and its 
group companies employed  by it to fulfill its obligations under this Group  Separation 
Agreement act  in accordance with the provisions of this Group Separation Agreement. 
9.3 Claims  under  this Group Separation Agreement may be assigned by any Party only with 
the consent of the other  Party. In this respect, assignments  are permitted only to group 
companies of  the assigning Party.
9.4 Group companies  of a Party within the meaning of this § 9 are also companies  that become  
group companies  of that Party within the meaning of Section 18 AktG after the spin-off 
taking effect.

§ 10
Dispute Resolution, Arbitration Clause
10.1 The Parties will endeavor  to amicably resolve any disputes  arising  under or in connection 
with this Group Separation Agreement  (including under the agreements entered into for its 
performance). Upon request by any Party, a representative  from  the upper  management  of 
both Parties will take part in the negotiations. Any Party may declare these efforts  canceled 
at any time by written declaration  to the other Party.  The Parties will endeavor to agree  on 
proceedings for an alternative  dispute resolution (ADR) and on rules for such proceedings 
(including the time schedule)  within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of such a 
cancelation declaration. If such an agreement is not reached, any Party  may initiate 
arbitration proceedings pursuant to § 10.2. 
10.2 Any disputes  under or in connection with this Group Separation Agreement or concerning  
its validity that are not resolved pursuant  to § 10.1, including any disputes relating to the 
termination or subsequent  amendment of this Group  Separation Agreement, will be finally 
decided by an arbitral tribunal  in accordance  with the Rules of Arbitration of the 
International Chamber  of Commerce ("ICC")  in the relevant valid  version, the provisions 
of the Spin-off and Transfer Agreement  entered into between the Parties notwithstanding. 
The arbitral tribunal shall  also decide with binding  effect on the validity of this arbitration 
clause. The place of arbitration is Munich. The number of arbitrators  is three.  Each Party 
appoints one arbitrator to be confirmed  by the ICC. These two arbitrators appoint the third 
arbitrator within  (thirty) 30 days of their appointment.  If the two arbitrators cannot  agree  
on the third arbitrator within this period of time, the third arbitrator will be appointed by 
the ICC. 
The language of the ADR and the arbitration proceedings is German. An order for the 
presentation of documents is permitted  only to the extent that any of the Parties refers 
explicitly to the documents in its written submissions. The consolidation of several  
arbitration proceedings pending at the ICC into singular arbitration proceedings is 
permitted only with the consent  of both Parties.  The Emergency Arbitrator Provisions do 
not apply.
10.3 The provisions of this § 10 do not constitute any limitation of the right of the Parties to 
request injunctive  relief  at the competent state  courts or at the arbitral tribunal.

§ 11
Final Provisions
11.1 This Group Separation Agreement  will take effect upon the spin-off taking effect. 
11.2 This Group Separation Agreement is governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of 
Germany to the exclusion of its conflict  of law rules.  
11.3 Amendments or supplements to this Group Separation  Agreement, including any 
amendments to or the contracting-out of this provision,  require written form unless stricter 
requirements of form  must be complied with. 
11.4 Any claims under this Group Separation Agreement  become time-barred upon expiration 
of 31 December 2030 to the extent  not otherwise  explicitly provided for in this Group 
Separation Agreement. In case the spin-off taking effect  in 2021, this point in time is 
thereby postponed to the expiration of 31 December 2031;  in the event  of the spin-off 
taking effect  later,  any claims under this Group  Separation Agreement  become time-barred 
upon expiration  of 31 December  of the year which is ten years  after the year of the spin-
off taking effect.
11.5 If one or more  provisions in this Group Separation Agreement are or become completely 
or partially void, invalid or impracticable, the validity  of this Group Separation Agreement 
and its other  provisions will not be affected thereby.  In such case, the void, invalid or 
impracticable provision will be deemed  replaced  by a provision that comes as close as 
possible to what was originally intended  by the Parties in terms of form,  content,  time, 
measure and scope  of applicability in accordance with the commercial intent and purpose 
of the void, invalid or impracticable provision. This applies  accordingly if this Group 
Separation Agreement  lacks any  provisions.

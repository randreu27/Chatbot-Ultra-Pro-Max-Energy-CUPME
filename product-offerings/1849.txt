New build hydrogen ready power plant concept 
Starting with natural gas today means preparing for tomorrow
Hydrogen readiness is key to new combined cycle power plants (CCPPs), when they do not require  
immediate Hydrogen operation now. An optimized H2-Ready concept can reduce future retrofit costs,  
while keeping front-end investments low. Hydrogen use ensures a seamless transition away from  
natural gas. An H2-Ready certificate from a neutral third party validates that your money is safely  
invested to avoid a stranded asset in the future.

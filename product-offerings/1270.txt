 Earnings Release  Q4 FY 202 3 
July 1 to September  30, 2023 
Munich, Germany , November  15, 2023 – Siemens Energy  today announced  its results for the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 202 3 that ended Sep-
tember  30, 202 3. 
Excellent performance of majority of Siemens Energy’s businesses 
overshadowed by wind business – agreement on framework to secure long -
term accelerated order growth  
“In a year of unprecedented challenges  for Siemens Energy , two-thirds of our businesses are on a profitable growth trajectory, meeting or exceeding 
their full -year targets. For our underperforming wind business all eyes must be on cost -out, selectivity and acceleration of productivity while con-
tinuously working on the  remediation. The current high demand for our products also brings challenges . We are therefore very glad that after very 
constructive discussions, we have now found a good solution with all pa rties to secure our energy transition -accelerated growth ”, says Christian 
Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy AG.  
Q4 Fiscal Year 2023  
• Development in Siemens Energy’s relevant markets continued to be strong , despite a n overall  subdued economic momentum . 
• After several quarters of substantial growth, o rders in the fourth quarter declined to €10.6bn and were down 7.8% on a comparable basis 
(excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) from the high prior -year figure , which was driven by large orders at Grid Technologies 
(GT) . Book -to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) was well above 1, leading to a record order backlog of €112bn  at year -end. 
• Revenue of € 8.5bn declined  by 2.5% on a comparable basis  mostly due to Siemens Gamesa . 
• Siemens Energy’s Profit  before special items was in the expected range with negative €487m (Q4  FY 2022: positive  €564m) mainly  driven by 
the loss at  Siemens Gamesa . Special items decreased to negative €64m (Q4  FY 2022: negative € 105m). Profit  for Siemens Energy came in at 
negative €551m (Q4  FY 2022: positive  €459m). 
• Accordingly, Siemens Energy showed  a Net loss of €870m (Q4  FY 2022: Net income  €354m). Corresponding basic earnings per share (EPS) were 
negative  at €1.04 (Q4  FY 2022: positive €0.33).  
• Free cash flow pre tax amounted to €1, 108m. This was below  strong prior -year quarter’s level of € 1,949 m, primarily  due to Siemens Gamesa , 
which benefited in the prior -year quarter from the sale of its wind farm development portfolio in Southern Europe . 
Fiscal Year 2023  
• Gas Services (GS), Grid Technologies (GT)  and Transformation of Industry (TI) showed an excellent perform ance  throughout the fiscal year , 
characterized by strong orders, successful  project execution and operational improve ments leading to increased profitability . On the other hand, 
there were negative effects at Siemens Gamesa due to quality issues in particular of the 4.X and 5.X onshore turbines as well as increased 
product costs and  ramp -up challenges in the offshore business.  
• Regarding the adjusted outlook in the third quarter, Siemens Energy met its guidance. Free cash flow pre tax  came in higher than expected . 
• Driven by GT and Siemens Gamesa , Siemens Energy’s orders exceeded the high level of the prior fiscal year by 33.8% on a comparable basis and 
rose to € 50.4bn (FY  2022: €38.3bn). 
• Revenue of € 31.1bn was up by 9. 9% on a comparable basis driven by growth in all segments ex cept  Siemens Gamesa . 
• Siemens Energy’s Profit  before special items decreased to negative €2,776m (FY  2022: positive €225m) due to the loss at S iemens Gamesa . 
Special items amounted to negative € 184m (FY  2022: negative € 413m) largely related to restructuring costs at Siemens Gamesa and costs i n 
connection with the integration of Siemens Gamesa . Profit for Siemens Energy came in at negative € 2,960m (FY  2022: negative € 188m). 
• Net loss of Siemens Energy was € 4,588m (FY 2022: €712m). Corresponding EPS were negative at €5.47 (FY  2022: negative €0.65).  
• Free cash flow pre tax decreased to € 784m (FY  2022: €1, 503m) driven by an increase of the negative Free cash flow pre tax at Siemens Gamesa 
and a decline of the positive Free cash flow pre tax at GS (from a n exceptionally high level) but supported by a strong cash flow at G T primarily 
due to advance payments from new projects . 
Fiscal Year 2024  
• For Siemens Energy in fiscal year 2024, we expect comparable revenue growth in a range of 3  % to 7  % and a Profit margin before special items 
between negative 2  % and positive 1 %. Furthermore, we expect  a Net income of up to  €1bn including impacts from disposals and the acceler-
ation of the portfolio transformation . Free cash flow pre tax is expected to be  around negative €1.0bn . In addition, we expect proceeds in a 
range of positive €2.5bn to €3.0bn from disposals and the acceleration of the portfolio tran sformation.

 • The decline in o rders year -over -year was primarily due to the GT busi-
ness area , mainly driven by lower  volume from large orders  and high 
comparative basis  in the fourth quarter of the previous year . 
• Book -to-bill ratio came in at 1. 24. The order backlog once again ex-
ceeded the previous record level and rose to  €112bn. 
• Revenue decreased moderately  primarily due to  Siemens Gamesa . 
• Service revenue improved moderately compared to prior -year quar -
ter’s level.  
• Profit before Special items dropped  year -over -year due to Siemens 
Gamesa ’s loss  which more than offset positive results  in all other seg-
ments . 
• Special items substantially declined as the prior -year quarter was 
burdened by charges  related to the restructuring of the business ac-
tivities in Russia . 
• All segments recorded a positive Free cash flow pre tax which, how-
ever, overall was below  the high prior -year quarter’s basis of com-
parison . This was  driven by  Siemens Gamesa  and GS.

from large orders in the solution business. In the prior fiscal  year, 
three of GT's largest orders (two offshore wind farm grid connections 
and a high -voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system) were 
received in the fourth quarter . 
• GT reported a Book -to-bill ratio of 1.13 with the order backlog rising 
to €23bn. 
• Revenue grew clearly , driven by the product  business  following its 
order development . 
• Profit before Special items and the corresponding margin rose 
sharply. The i ncrease  was driven by higher  volume  and project cost 
improvements . The prior -year quarter was burdened by supply chain 
related effects .

 • Significant  increase of orders year-over -year was supported by or-
ders in the field of electric LNG and Hydrogen especially in the Sus-
tainable Energy Systems and the Electrification, Automation, Digital-
ization business es. 
• Book-to-bill ratio was 1.37. The o rder backlog increased to  €7bn. 
• Revenue was above prior -year quarter’s level with double -digit 
growth in service revenue . 
• As expected, Profit  before Special items declined  year -over -year. Pos-
itive contributions from an improved business mix due to a higher 
service share and operational improvements were offset by one -time 
impacts and currency headwinds . 
• Special items related to restructuring costs in connection with divest-
ments and footprint adjustments.

 • Moderate o rder growth was driven by the offshore and service busi-
nesses , which were supported by a  large order in Taiwan in total  
worth around  €2bn. Onshore orders decreased . On the one hand, 
this was  due to a sales stop for certain onshore platforms related to 
the known quality issues, and on the other hand, prior-year’s quarter 
benefited from the sale of the wind farm development portfolio in 
Southern Europe.  
• Book-to-bill ratio came in at 1.63. The  order backlog rose to €42bn. 
• Revenue declined significant ly due to the quality issues in the on-
shore business  and factory load plan changes  at the offshore busi-
ness,  while  prior-year quarter included the sale mentioned above.  
• Profit before Special items was negative, burdened by lower profit 
contributions from the execution of the order backlog mainly related 
to previous quarter’s quality issues in the onshore and service busi-
nesses as well as  increased product costs and continued ramp -up 
challenges in the offshore activities . Additionally, prior -year’s quarter 
benefited from income of €565m from the sale mentioned above.

 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements includes items , 
which management does not consider to be indicative of the segments’ 
performance – mainly group management costs (management and cor-
porate functions) and other central items, Treasury activities as well as 
eliminations. Other central items include Siemens  brand fees, corporate 
services  (e.g. management of the Group’s real estate portfolio (except 
Siemens Gamesa ), which was allocated to the Gas and Power segment  
in the prior year) , corporate  projects, centrally held equity interests and 
other items.  
The negative change year -over -year in Reconciliation to Consolidated 
Financial Statements was mainly due to increased costs for corporate 
functions and other central items . This was offset by a negative one -
time effect related to a legacy power plant construction project in the 
prior -year quarter.

6 Outlook  
In fiscal year 2024, we expect for Siemens Energy  a comparable revenue growth  (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects)  in a range 
of 3 % to 7  % (actual figure FY 2023: 9.9  %) and a Profit margin before special items between negative 2  % and positive  1 % (actual figure FY 2023: 
negative 8.9  %). Furthermore, we expect a  Net income of up to €1bn (actual figure FY 2023: Net loss of €4,588m) including impacts from disposals 
and the acceleration of the portfolio transformation . We assume a negative Free cash flow pre tax of around €1.0bn  (actual figure FY 2023: positive 
€784m) . In addition, we expect proceeds in a range of positive €2.5bn to €3.0bn from disposals and the acceleration of the portfoli o transfor-
mation . 
The outlook for Siemens Energy does not include charges related to legal and regulatory matters.  
Overall assumptions per business area  
• GS assumes  a comparable  revenue  growth  of negative  4 % to 0 % (actual  figure  FY 2023:  positive  17.7  %) and a Profit  margin  before  special  
items  of 9 % to 11 % (actual  figure  FY 2023:  9.5 %). 
• GT plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of 1 8 % to 22 % (actual figure FY 2023: 16.6  %) and a Profit margin before special items 
between 7 % and 9 % (actual figure FY 2023: 7.5 %). 
• TI expect s a comparable  revenue  growth  of 8 % to 12 % (actual  figure  FY 2023:  12.0  %) and a Profit  margin  before  special  items  of 5 % to 7 % 
(actual  figure  FY 2023:  5.1 %). 
• Siemens Gamesa  assumes a comparable revenue growth of  0 % to positive 4 % (actual figure FY 2023: negative 5.1  %) and a negative Profit 
before special items of around €2bn (actual figure FY 2023: negative €4,347 m).

Customer Benefit
Proven 80% reduction in NOx emissions compared to
other conventional liquid fuels
Up-to 95% CO2reduction
Enhanced turbine performance , with a power increase of at least
10% when running on methanol, thus providing more energy output
Ongoing collaboration with the Net Zero Technology Centre to
demonstrate the emissions reduction of methanol as a fuel
supplied by Proman.
Customer Challenge/Driver
Toreduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net-zero targets ,
there is an urgent need for sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil
fuels in power generation. The Net Zero Technology Centre and
Siemens Energy , have demonstrated the viability of methanol as
alow-emission fuel in gas turbines, thereby furthering the transition
tocleaner energy sources .
Portfolio Elements/Scope
Siemens Energy utilized 3D printing to produce new components
for the SGT-A35 needed for methanol fuel conversion, showing the
feasibility of retrofitting existing gas turbines for decarbonized
operations .SGT-A35 operates on methanol with 80%
less NOx emissions in AberdeenPartnership |  UK, October 2024

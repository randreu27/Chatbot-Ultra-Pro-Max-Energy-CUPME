5TUBOLY HV winding machine
Siemens Energy cast-resin distribution transformer (CRT) 
has been in successful service since 1965. Over 150,000 
units Siemens Energy CRT have proven themselves in power 
distribution or converter operation all around the globe. 
HV foil winding
The high-voltage windings twine together by copper foil 
(or aluminum foil) interleaved with high-grade insulating 
foils. The coils are placed in a heated mold and are potted 
in a vacuum furnace with specially blended epoxy resins. 
The vacuum casting process excludes the air in the windings 
to ensure the low partial discharge. The thermal expansion 
coefficients of conductor and cast resin are so similar that 
thermal stresses resulting from load changes are kept to a 
minimum degree to improve the anti-crack ability. Compared 
with impregnating products, it processes higher overload 
capacity.Epoxy resin, curing agent, insulating materials and other 
major materials of Siemens Energy CRT are imported for 
quality assurance. The registered trademark GEAFOL® and 
CARECO® refer to Siemens Energy aluminum and copper 
transformer respectively. Siemens Energy CRT is the preferred 
choice in industrial field providing with high performance 
and low losses. PRODUCT FEATURES
Foil winding is better than wire winding
The foil windings combine a simple technique with a high 
degree of electrical safety. The insulation is subjected to 
less electrical stress than in other type of windings. In a 
conventional round-wire winding, the interlayer voltage

The interlayer voltage add up to several times of the interturn voltage.Foil winding
The interlayer voltage equal to the interturn voltage.reaches several times of the interturn voltage. However, in 
foil winding, the interlayer voltage equals to the interturn 
voltage. Thus, the foil winding can withstand higher AC and 
impulse voltage.

LV foil winding
The standard low-voltage winding twine by copper foil 
(or aluminum foil) with interleaved DMD which bear less 
dielectric stress. The assembled coils are then oven-cured to Vacuum casting
Windings are casted in the automatic vacuum casting machine 
according	to	specific	curing	temperature	curve.	Horizontal	
casting process is adopted to facilitate gas discharge. Accurate 
control of resin component proportion and vacuum degree,

form uniformly bonded solid cylinders that are anti-moisture. 
Such winding has excellent dynamic stability under short-
circuit condition.

Step lap lamination
IP20 Steel EnclosuresStep Lap Lamination
Excellent cold rolled grain-oriented silicon steel is used for 
core. The silicon steel is cut by automatic machine with high 
accuracy and small burr. Low no-load loss and current are 
achieved by the technology of pin-stacking and stacking 
without upper yoke. The structure can reduce the noise 
effectively.
Enclosures
CRT is recommended to be installed indoor, for example in 
electric room or in various mental enclosure. Transformer shall 
avoid the live contact of the terminals or winding surface, 
direct sunlight and water. A variety of indoor enclosures in 
different protection classes (IP20, IP21 is recommended) are 
available for the transformers. They can be deposited alone or 
assembled with high/low-voltage switchgear panel as a indoor 
compact substation. If the site has poor ventilation, fans or 
other devices may be needed. Still, transformer can be placed 
outdoor with IP33 enclosure or above.
Temperature monitoring
Each CRT is equipped with a temperature indicator, with three 
sensors in LV windings. PT100 sensors are used for detecting 
maximum temperature of winding. Temperature indicator 
protects the transformer by output alarm or trip signal. Special 
type	of	temperature	indicator（RS485,	4~20rnA)	is	as	request	of	
customer.
8Overload curve of Siemens Energy GEAFOL® CRT (without cooling fans)
Overload capability
Siemens Energy CRT can be overloaded up to 40% with a corresponding 
increase in impedance voltage and load losses providing that additional 
cooling fans are installed. Short-time overloads makes no difference 
to transformer as long as the maximum winding temperatures are not 
exceeded (depending on initial load and ambient temperature).
Cooling fans
9Flammability test
Fire safety
Siemens Energy CRT is purely made up of material that 
is	flame-retardant	and	self-extinguishing.	No	additional	
substances, such as aluminum oxide trihydrate, which could 
negatively	influence	the	mechanical	stability	of	the	cast-
resin molding material, are used. Internal arcing caused by 
electrical	faults	and	externally	flames	will	not	result	in	any	
explosion	or	fire.As	long	as	the	fire	is	put	out,	the	transformer 	
will extinguish itself. This design has been approved by 
fire	officials	in	many	countries	for	installation	in	populated	
buildings and other constructions. Many tests show that 
combustion residue does no harm to environment.
Siemens Energy CRT can meet the requirements of protection 
classes below:
• Environmental category E3
• Climatic category C3
• Fire category F1
Connection
Instead of the standard terminals, plug-type elbow 
connectors can be supplied for the high-voltage side with LI 
up to 170kV. Primary cables are usually connected with the 
transformer from trenches on the bottom and can also be 
connected from top. Secondary connections can be made 
by multiple insulated cables or bus bar. Flexible connection 
is recommended to reduce the noise in particular cases. 
Recommend the following connections: 
10From Transformer to Sensformer®
Transformers are positioned at each critical node in the 
energy grid, from power generation stations all the way 
down to industrial and private consumers – yet up until now, 
they were only perceived as “voltage transforming devices”. 
With the newly introduced Sensformer®, the transformer has 
evolved into an info-hub.
The Sensformer® comes with visualization and analytics. 
Operators get a comprehensive and quick overview 
about their assets and can thus improve their operations. 
The corresponding data platform is an open ecosystem 
intelligently using data from the Sensformer®.

CRT with on-load tap changer
CRT with on-load tap changer is available up to rating of 30MVA. The rated voltage 
extends to 36KV, and the maximum impulse voltage is 170KV. Such transformer is 
mainly for occasions demanding high in power supply, such as modern industrial plants, 
hospitals,	office	and	apartment	blocks	and	shopping	centers.
Dual low voltage transformer
This kind of transformer, whose primary and secondary side are both low voltage, is 
usually used as drilling transformer, propulsion transformer or lighting transformer on 
offshore drilling platform or vessel. It can also be used as an isolation transformer when 
electrical safety is highly required.Rectifier transformer
This kind of transformer is designed for the special demands of thyristor converter or 
diode	rectifier	system.
Effects from such equipment and additional structure requirements:
• Increased load caused by harmonic currents
• Balancing of phase currents in multiple winding system (e.g. 12-pulse system)
• Short-time overload factor reaches 2.5CUSTOMIZED PRODUCTS
19
Dry-type transformer for offshore wind power
This kind of transformer technically matches the requirements for offshore use, it is small 
in size, light in weight, low in temperature rise, strong in overload capability, vibration-
resistant, anti-corrosion and equipped with enclosure with high defend grade.
Only part of the customized products are listed above. Customized products of Siemens Energy CRT are also including reactor and so on. For further requirements, 
please contact us.Water-cooled transformer
The water circuiting in the enclosure facilitates cooling of the air, thereby improve the 
heat radiation capacity of the transformer. The structure of this transformer is compact, it 
is mainly used in vessels and other places where the size and weight of the transformer is 
limited.
• Specially design for drilling platform, tunnel machine, wind power and marine 
equipment, usually installed in places with limited space and frequent vibration.
• It consists of a dry type transformer and IP44 protection shell, the main components 
also contain the water cooled heat exchangers and motors.
• Overload capacity up to 50%, weight approx. 20% lower, heat transfer to the 
environmental room max. 10% of the total losses only, cooling water takes away the 
rest of the heat.

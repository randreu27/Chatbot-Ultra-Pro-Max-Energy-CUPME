Navigate the energy transition
Global fragmentation. Chronic instability in politics and markets weakens the 
resolve – and capabilities – of governments and companies to adress climate 
change. Net-zero targets become a legacy of the 2020s in all but a few 
countries. Emissions are not significantly cut from 2021 levels.
Discord 
2.9°CThe combined effects recurrent global crises led to strong actions by 
governments on a range of security threats, including energy and climate 
change. Ambitions to diversify energy economies and eleminate dependence 
on fossil fuels coincide with efforts to meet net-zero targets. Revolutionary 
progress is made in altering the global energy mix and greenhouse gas 
emissions pathway.
Green Rules
1.8°C
A broad range of fundamental changes across government, markets, and 
society set in motion a long-term energy transition that is faster than previously 
anticipated, but complex challenges remain. Action on decarbonization varies 
across the world based on country- and region-specific interests and is closely 
linked to perceptions of (and response to) the energy security debate.

2.4°CThe role of gas fired power generation
in future energy scenarios
The energy landscape is changing rapidly, and this may also affect the operation of combined 
cycle power plants. This document first cites the IHS Markit 2024 Energy and Climate Scenarios1 for 
the development of the world’s gas fired  power generation. In conclusion, it shows that combined 
cycle plants can be flexibly  adjusted to various operating scenarios, maximizing value
for their owners.G
as-fired power plants have seen a
global surge due to abundant natural gas 
resources, high efficiency, flexibility, lower
costs, environmental benefits, and market
liberalization. Technological advancements 
have made extraction of gas deposits 
affordable, while the efficiency of combined-
cycle gas turbine plants has converted gas to 
electricity effectively. These plants also boast 
quick construction, adaptability to electricity 
demand, and lower upfront costs. Additionally, 
they produce fewer pollutants and emissions 
than coal power plants. Deregulation has also 
spurred competition and encouraged efficient,
cost-effective plant construction.
From 1993 to 2023, electricity generated from
natural gas tripled, with installed capacity 
increasing even more rapidly. Despite the 
likelihood of this growth slowing down, gas-
fired power plants remain crucial, with their
future hinging on success in reducing carbon 
dioxide emissions. Replacing coal and oil powergeneration with Combined Cycle Power Plants 
can rapidly reduce CO2 emissions and help 
keep global warming below 2.5°C. However, 
for more manageable climate change effects, 
global warming must stay below 2°C, requiring 
further reduction and eventual cessation of CO2 
emissions from gas-fired power plants.  
In the IHS Market Scenario, the operation 
of existing gas plants is expected to vary, 
with the least operation under the green 
rules scenario. In the inflicted scenario, the 
operation of existing plants may be affected 
by new and more efficient plants entering 
the market, potentially aligning it with the 
green rules scenario. Regional, country, and 
site-specific factors will influence the energy 
transition‘s direction and pace, resulting in 
varying operational outlooks for individual 
power plants. Siemens Energy is committed to 
supporting customers in maximizing the value 
of their assets in this changing landscape.
Certainly, the operation depicted above represents an expected global average. However, the direction 
and speed of the energy transition will significantly vary, influenced by regional, national, and site-spe -
cific factors. Consequently, the operational outlook for individual power plants will also differ greatly.  
This document aims to provide an overview of our offerings.
At Siemens Energy, we are dedicated to helping our customers maximize the value of their 
assets, regardless of what the future may bring.

Recommendations for 
plants with a stable  
operating outlook
Despite the average trend outlined above, the actual 
operation of power plants will vary significantly, with 
a substantial number of plants continuing to operate 
under a baseload regime.  
This could be due to:1.1 Increasing power output and efficiency
For these plants, improving the power plant‘s 
performance may be advantageous. Potential 
benefits of such modifications include:
• A significantly faster implementation and
lower specific investment cost, compared
to constructing a new power plant.
• Minimal requirements for additional
permitting.
• Increased revenue.
• Higher efficiency could reduce the specific
costs for fuel and carbon emission certificates
and enhance the power plant‘s position in the 
merit order.A rapidly increasing demand for power, 
consequently leading to a decreasing 
reserve margin, combined with u
nfavorable conditions for renewable
energy, such as space limitations or 
insufficient grid infrastructure.
Decarbonization efforts through shifting 
from coal or oil to natural gas as the 
primary fuel.
The use of gas-fired power generation 
in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
applications for industrial or domestic 
heat generation could also necessitate 
continued baseload operation.Prime example of such products are our A
dvanced Turbine Efficiency Packages (ATEP)
as well as the Si3D™ upgrades. The heart of 
such upgrade involves replacing the blades and 
vanes in the turbine section with a new design 
featuring improved airfoils and reduced cooling 
air consumption. Table 2 shows the potential p
erformance benefits.  
 In 
addition to ATEP and Si3DTM, Siemens Energy
has developed several other upgrades suitable
for all types of gas turbines and different market 
environments.
Modifications and Upgrades 
can significantly improve 
the plants power output  
and efficiency.When considering a performance upgrade, it would be beneficial to also explore a 
Hydrogen Cofiring upgrade (H2DeCarb). Depending on the version of the Gas Turbine, 
combining these upgrades could lead to significant synergies, as well in capital 
expenditure (CAPEX) as in decarbonization.

1.2 Maintaining plant reliability
Many existing gas-fired power plants were built in the early 21st century. As these facilities age,
maintaining high operational standards requires increased effort.
Our Siemens Energy Omnivise digital portfolio includes digital Asset Performance Management
(APM) tools that enable proactive measures for ensuring plant reliability. These tools, along with
our 24/7 remote diagnostic services, facilitate swift technical issue resolution and condition 
based maintenance planning.F
or the gas turbines, we recommend doing the  Rotor and Casing 
Inspection and Evaluation (RCIE) . We offer a concept that combines 
preventive component replacement and an extended scope of Non-
Destructive Examination (NDE), based on operational history and future 
outlook. Our Rotor Exchange program (ROTEX)  mitigates the risk of 
outage extension due to rotor de-stacking and corrective measures.Gas Turbine

Our steam turbine maintenance concept advises a major inspection at 
approximately 100,000 operating hours and a more comprehensive 
lifetime assessment at around 200,000 hours. We support contingency 
planning by recommending strategic spare parts, with reservation 
schemes available for major components such as for the HP Barrel 
Replacement  or the Valve Exchange program (VALVEX) .
Generator Similarly, for the generator, maintaining operational reliability becomes 
critical with increased operating hours and startups. Our GenAdvisor™ 
online monitoring and condition assessment tools enable continuous 
monitoring of partial discharge, stator end winding vibrations, and other 
parameters. This improves knowledge about the generator‘s condition, 
aiding scheduled maintenance planning and reducing unscheduled 
outages. We also provide inspection and repair recommendations and 
offer reservation concepts for major spare parts or components.

1.3 Brownfield Exchange  
(BEX) or footprint  
replacement
Especially for older engines with continued 
positive operation outlook it is worth 
considering the exchange of the rotating 
equipment with new or shop repaired 
equipment. By doing so it is possible to 
combine necessary lifetime-extending 
measures with significant performance 
increases and a higher availability, due to 
an optimized future maintenance regime.
Carbon capture is a decarbonization 
solution that may be specifically
interesting for baseload power plants 
with low fuel costs. Partnering with 
expert companies for the provisionof add on plants we support our 
customers’ in adding carbon capture

ptions for power plants shifting tow
ards residual load coverage
The share of renewable power generation is growing in most countries of the world. As a result, 
conventional power generation is gradually decreasing, and the operating regime of gas turbine 
power plants may shift from baseload operation to the coverage of residual load and the provision 
of ancillary services. This trend goes along with an increased need for operational flexibility.  Power 
plants are required to startup faster, to have higher load gradients and a broader operating range.
Also, ancillary services become more important.2.1 Fl
ex-Power ServicesTMand Digitalization
With our Flex-Power ServicesTM Portfolio we offer a range of products intended to increase flexibility
of your combined cycle power plant. Some examples for such products are:
Start and Stop Optimization . With this solution, the startup times for hot or 
warm restarts as well as the shutdown times may be reduced by up to 50%.
With the Turn Up  it is possible to temporarily increase the maximum power 
output of a combined cycle plant by up to 9 MW by increasing the operating 
range of the Inlet Guide Vanes (IGV).
In the Om nivise Dispatch Optimization Module  we combine market forecast w
ith weather data and our technical domain knowledge with the intention toim
prove the accuracy of your energy market transactions.
Load Gradient Optimization  is designed to improve the plant 's capability
for ancillary services. The GT load gradient can be increased to up to 9MW/s
for Frequency Containment Reserve operation (FCR) and up to 50MW/min in
automatic Frequency Restauration Reserve (aFRR).
With the Part Load Optimization Upgrade  (PLOU), it is possible to significantly
reduce the plant 's  minimum environmental load.

2.2 Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)
As the production of renewable energy depends on the availability of sun and wind, the importance  
of storage applications that fill the gap between supply and demand is increasing. Therefore, regulators  
and transmission system operators encourage for the installation of grid scale Battery Energy Storage  
Systems (BESS).• 
A significant portion of the investment costs
of a battery storage system is required for grid
connection, transformers, high voltage switch 
gears and their controls. These components
are already available in power plants and may
be shared. Further, the size of the BESS can be
smaller, as the power plant can serve as a backup. 
In addition to that BESS have the potential to
replace diesel engines required for black start 
capabilities.
• Power plants typically achieve higher efficiency
values in higher load ranges. Therefore, the 
average efficiency  of a power plant can be 
improved in times of lower demand by operating 
at a higher load range whilst charging a BESS.
• In some markets, BESSs compete with traditional
power plants in auctions for the provision of 
ancillary services and capacity. However, a
solution that combines both technologies in
a smart way may be able to provide the best 
relationship between offered service parameters 
like reaction time, power range and service 
duration and cost.Compared to a greenfield solution,  
adding a BESS to a power plant may  
provide multiple advantages:

between H2 and natural gas.H2
2.3 HydrogenWhilst BESSs are suitable for storage 
durations in the range of less than 
an hour to one day, production and 
re-electrification hydrogen is one 
of the most promising solutions for 
periods ranging from multiple days 
to weeks or even months. Other 
than for BESS, the energy contained 
in the hydrogen can be transported, 
stored and used at different location 
than it was generated. 
Although, for a foreseeable 
number of years, green hydrogen 
may be rare and too expensive 
for the use in power generation, 
societies have clear expectations 
towards decarbonization, and 
investors require compliance 
to environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) standards. In 
such environment any investment 
in fossil assets may only be 
approved with a clear perspective on reduction of CO2 emissions. 
Therefore, Siemens Energy will
stepwise increase the hydrogen
capabilities of our engines to
100%. We are also supporting our 
customers by certifying whether
and to what extend our gas
turbines can converted to hydrogen 
combustion at a later point of time.
A considerable number of our 
customers is committed to the 
development towards hydrogenba-
sed power generation, and some of 
them want to demonstrate the 
feasibility of the technology by 
validating the hydrogen co-firing
capabilities of their units. We are 
very happy for getting the chance
to support these customers’ and are 
committed to jointly raise the bar.Siemens Energy is clearly 
committed to the development 
of a hydrogen economy, as well 
on the production side with our 
electrolyzer-portfolio, as on the 
re-electrification side with gas 
turbines capable of burning 
hydrogen.

Potential m odifications for power plants
transitioning to standby or seasonal 
peaker operation
In markets where the share of renewable energy 
is already in the range of 60% or beyond, some 
combined cycle plants already transitioned into a 
standby or seasonal peaker mode. And it is likely 
that other plants will follow this path. This may 
be challenging, as the traditional revenue stream 
of power generation is nearly disappearing.  
Therefore, plant owners need to find other  
  revenue streams. In some markets and 
depending on the position of the plant in the 
power grid they may move into a strategic 
reserve, with a reimbursement of fixed and 
variable cost on cost plus fee basis. Other 
possible or future income streams are the 
provision of ancillary services, capacity 
mechanisms or power arbitrage.
With reduced power generation  
the cost structure of a plant changes 
significantly and personal costs  
become, compared to fuel costs, 
significantly more relevant. 
Adapting the cost structure may 
therefore be critical for winning 
auctions for ancillary or capacity 
services. Digitalization makes it  
possible to spread the use of  
human resources over several  
assets and it may be anyhow  
necessary as a reaction on skills 
shortages.
 
 Our offering for Remote Operation 
and Maintenance as a Service
(ROMS) or for transferring your plant
into a Autonomous Power Plant may 
further help to achieve your targets.3.1 Adapting the Cost Structure
The plant generator can be upgraded into a Rotating Grid Stabilizer (RGS) or synchronized condenser
by adding a flywheel and a clutch. Like this it is possible to provide Synchronous Inertial Response
(SIR), short circuit power and reactive power, even at times when the turbines are not operating.
By engaging the clutch, the plant can still be used for power generation. When combining a RGS with
a BESS it is possible to provide frequency response also when the gas turbines are not running (cold
frequency response).3.2 Converting the Generator into a Rotating Grid Stabilizer

HYFLEXPOWER: The world’s first integrated 
power -to-X-to-power hydrogen gas turbine 
demonstrator  
 
• Green hydrogen project launched in May 2020  
• Decarbonizing a paper factory by modernizing an existing combined heat and 
power plant  in France  
 
With the HYFLEXPOWER project, a consortium made up of Engie Solutions, 
Siemens Gas and Power, Centrax, Arttic, German Aerospace Center (DLR) and four 
European universities are implementing a project funded by the European 
Commission under the Horizon 2020 Framework Program for Research and 
Innovation  (Grant Agreement 884229). The implementation of this project, the 
world's very first industrial -scale power -to-X-to-power1 demonstrator with an 
advanced hydrogen turbine, will be launched at Smurfit Kappa PRF’s site - a 
company specialized in manufacturing recycled paper - in Saillat -sur-Vienne, 
France. The purpose of this project is to prove that hydrogen can be produced and 
stored from renewa ble electricity and then added with up to 100 percent to the 
natural gas currently used with combined heat and power plants. For this an existing 
Siemens SGT -400 industrial gas turbine will be upgraded to convert stored 
hydrogen into electricity and therma l energy.

Reference number:  HQGPPR202005275884EN  Page 2/8 A world ’s first: Industrial -scale power -to-X-to-power demonstrator   
Through its Horizon 2020 framework program the European Commission 
supports highly innovative research and demonstration projects aiming at 
developing and creating innovative products and services and thus stimulating 
growth in Europe. For this, the Europe an Commission is awarding grants in a 
competitive procedure in which HYFLEXPOWER was able to assert itself against 
a large number of competitors.  
With this particular project , HYFLEXPOWER will demonstrate that renewable 
hydrogen can serve as a flexible means of storing energy which can then be 
used to power a high -power industrial turbine.   
Storing fluctuating renewable energy is one of the major challenges of the energy 
transition. In this context, the stakeholders involved in the HYFLEXPOWER project 
are developing new technologies which can be used across the whole power -to-X-
to-power1 cycle. The installed demonstrator will be used to store excess renewable 
electricity in t he form of green hydrogen. During periods of high demand this stored 
green hydrogen will then be used to generate electrical energy to be fed into the 
grid. 
Engie Solutions has been entrusted with producing energy at the Smurfit Kappa site 
in Saillat -sur-Vienne, France. At the site, Engie Solutions operates a 12 MWe 
combined heat and power facility which produces steam for the manufacturing 
company's requirements. The conversion of an existing infrastructure  has the 
advantage of  significantly lower cost s and minimized lead time compared to a 
greenfield site. The project will develop and demonstrate an advanced plant concept 
that will contribute to modernizing and improving the factory's existing power plant. 
 
1 According to the ADEME (France's agency for environment and energy management), 
“Power to X” (or “P2X”) is the act of converting electricity into another  energy vector. For the 
HYFLEXPOWER project, the “X”  vector is hydrogen .

Reference number: HQGPPR202005275 884EN  Page 3/8 During two demonstration campaigns, the facility w ill be powered by a mix of natural 
gas and hydrogen, ultimately aiming for up to 100 percent hydrogen operation. In 
this regard, the overall goal of the HYFLEXPOWER project is to test an entirely 
green hydrogen -based power supply for a completely carbon -free energy mix . This 
would save up to 65,000 tons of CO 2 per year for a SGT -400 at baseload operation.  
 
An exclusively European technology  
The consortium selected following the call for proposals is made up exclusively of 
European companies and bodies. Each stakeholder's role is defined as follows:  
- Engie Solutions will build the hydrogen production and storage facility, 
including the natural gas/hydrogen mixing station prior to the turbine  
- Siemens Gas and Power will supply the electrolyser for hy drogen production 
and develop the hydrogen gas turbine  
- Centrax will upgrade the package for hydrogen operation and install the new 
turbine  
- German Aerospace Cent er (DLR) together with the University College 
London, University of Duisburg -Essen and Lund Uni versity will support the 
hydrogen turbine technology development  
- National Technical University of Athens will perform economic, 
environmental and social assessments of the concept  
- Arttic  will support the operational project management and the project’s 
communication activities.  
The project's total budget is close to €15.2 million, of which €10.5 million will be 
contributed entirely by the European Union under the Horizon 2020 program.

Product Stewardship, p. 57-60Product safety encompasses the safety of all products, solutions, and services manufactured, provided, and/or sold by Siemens 
Energy. These products, solutions, and services are developed according to the latest technical knowledge and comply with applica-
ble legal requirements to ensure that they do not pose an unacceptable risk to life, health, property, or the environment. Product 
stewardship at Siemens Energy follows the key standards of the ISO 14000 series, with individual approaches for each Business Area. 
The approaches are centrally supported by the respective Global Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) departments. In fiscal year 
2023, improvement measures included a specific training course for product safety officers and their line managers and the launch of 
an all-employee training video. Numerous workshops have been held to analyze our strengths and weaknesses and collaborate to 
better serve our customers, both internal and external. During fiscal year 2023, no significant product safety incidents were reported.

Product Lifecycle Management Percentage of products by revenue 
that contain IEC 62474 declarable 
substancesRT-EE-410a.1  Sustainability Report 2023:   
Product Stewardship, p. 57-60We are currently not reporting products by revenue that contain IEC 62474 declarable substances. However, Siemens Energy uses 
globally standardized materials and substances registers for restricted and declarable substances and products. The lists identify any 
substances that need to be declared for each product and are updated every six months according to current directives from the 
European Chemicals Agency. As part of the Siemens Energy supplier assessment and qualification process, suppliers are required to 
identify whether any of their products or components contain substances that need to be declared according to the specific legisla-
tion. Suppliers then need to provide a detailed declaration should any such substances be used within their design and manufactur -
ing activities. We encourage our suppliers to use the industry substance management platform BOMCheck to share declarations for 
substances of very high concern (SVHC) and link this information to our IT systems. In this way, we can proactively manage risks relat-
ed to substance restrictions. The implementation of the Substances of Concern in Products (SCIP) reporting requirement, a database 
established under the EUʼs Waste Framework Directive that registers products containing SVHCs, is still ongoing.

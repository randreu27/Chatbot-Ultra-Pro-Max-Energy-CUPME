Major inspection 
(highest service
revenue event)Hot gas path inspection 
(significant service 
revenue event)Regular service intervals 
crucial to maintain turbine 
performance and availability.1
Turbines are serviced in outages 
of varying scope (minor/hot gas 
path/major inspection).2
Timing of outages and thus 
revenue recognition depend
on turbine uptime.3

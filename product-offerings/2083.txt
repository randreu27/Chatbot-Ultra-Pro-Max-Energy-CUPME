publicly available the Software, e.g. in the context of application service  
providing or in other contexts, and to copy the Software to the extent  
required, always provided that the number of licenses being used at  
any one time does not exceed the number of licenses purchased;  
2.1.7   to sublicense the right of use under section 2.1.6 above to Affiliates,  
contracted third parties and distributors.  
2.2  In addition to the rights granted in section 2.1 above, the Customer,  
Affiliates and distributors are authorized to allow end customers to  
transfer the respective licenses.  
2.3      All sublicenses granted by the Customer must contain appropriate pro -  
tection for the intellectual property rights of the Supplier in the Software.  
All sublicenses must contain any contractual provisions used by the  
Customer to protect its own intellectual property rights.  
2.4      The Supplier shall inform the Customer - at the latest at the time the  
order is confirmed - whether the products and services to be delivered  
contain open source components.  
In the context of this provision “open source components” means any  
software, hardware or other information that is provided royalty -free by  
the respective licensor to any user on the basis of a license with the  
right to modify and/or to distribute (e.g. GNU General Public License  
(GPL), the GNU Lesser GPL (LGPL), or the MIT License). Should the  
products and services delivered by the Supplier contain open source  
components, the Supplier shall comply with all applicable open source  
license terms and shall grant all those rights to the Customer and pro -  
vide all information which the Customer needs in order to comply him -  
self with the applicable license terms. In particular, the Supplier must  
deliver to the Customer promptly after the order is confirmed the follow -  
ing:  
-    A schedule of all open source components used, indicating the rel -  
evant license, its version and including a copy of the complete text  
of such license and including a reference to copyright and/or author -  
ship. Such schedule must have an understandable structure and  
contain a table of contents.  
- The complete source code of the relevant open source software,  
including scripts and information regarding its generating environ -  
ment insofar as the applicable open source conditions require this.  
2.5      The Supplier shall by the time of order confirmation at the latest inform  
the Customer in writing whether any open source licenses used by the  Supplier 
might be subject to a Copyleft Effect which could affect the products of the 
Customer. In the context of this provision, “Copyleft Effect“ means that the 
provisions of the open source license require that  certain of the Supplier’s products, 
as well as any products derived from such products, may only be redistributed in 
accordance with the terms of the open source license, e.g. only if the source code 
is disclosed. In case any open source licenses used by the Supplier are subject to a  
“Copyleft Effect” as defined above, then the Customer is entitled to can -  
cel the order within two weeks of receipt of this information.  
 
3. Term and Penalty for Breach  
3.1   For the purposes of establishing the timeliness of delivery, the relevant  
point in time is the date of receipt at the place of destination/delivery  
according to Incoterms ® 2020 designated by the Customer, and for  deliveries involving installation, commissioning or rectification services,  
the relevant point in time shall be the date of acceptance by the Cus -  
tomer.  
3.2   If any delay in delivery or performance or rectification is anticipated, the  
Customer shall be notified immediately and its decision sought.  
3.3   If – in the event of delay – the Supplier cannot prove that it is not re -  
sponsible for the delay, the Customer may charge a penalty in respect  
of each commenced working day of delay amounting to 0.3 % (zero  
point three percent) but not exceeding a total of 5 % (five percent) of  
the total value of the contract.  
In the event that the appropriate reservation of rights is not made at the  
time of acceptance of delivery, services or rectification, this penalty may  
still be claimed if the reservation of rights is made no later than the date  
of final payment.  
3.4    Additional or other statutory rights are not affected hereby.  
 
4.       Transfer of Risk, Dispatch and Place of Performance, Transfer of  
Title  
4.1      For deliveries involving installation, commissioning or services, the  
transfer of risk occurs on acceptance and for deliveries not involving  
installation or commissioning, the transfer of risk shall be upon receipt  
by the Customer at the named place of destination/delivery according  
to Incoterms ® 2020. Unless agreed otherwise, DDP (named place of  
destination) Incoterms ® 2020 shall apply, if (a) the seat of the Supplier  
and the named place of destination are within the same country or if (b)  
the seat of the Supplier and the named place of destination are both  within the 
European Union. If neither (a) nor (b) are fulfilled, then DAP  
(named place of destination) Incoterms ® 2020 shall apply, unless  
agreed otherwise.  
4.2      Unless otherwise agreed, the costs of adequate packaging shall be  
borne by the Supplier. In case transportation costs are borne by the  
Customer, notice of readiness for dispatch shall be given together with  
the information set out in section 4.3 hereunder. On the Customer’s re -  
quest a Siemens Energy routing order tool must be used by the Sup -  
plier. Transport shall be arranged by the Supplier at the lowest possible  
cost, insofar as the Customer has not requested a particular method of  
delivery or the conclusion of the contract for carriage by the Customer.  
Any supplementary costs arising from non -conformity with the transport  
requirements including costs arising from the non -application of the Sie -  
mens Energy routing order tool shall be borne by the Supplier. In case  
DAP/DDP (named place of destination) Incoterms ® 2020 is agreed,  
the Customer may also determine the method of transportation. Any  
supplementary costs arising from the need to meet the delivery dead -  
line by way of expedited delivery shall be borne by the Supplier.  
4.3      Each delivery shall include a packing note or delivery note with details  
of the contents as well as the complete order number.  
4.4      As far as the Customer and the Supplier agree that the Supplier orders  
the transport of deliveries containing dangerous goods for account of  
the Customer, the Supplier is responsible to transfer the necessary le -  
gally required dangerous goods data to the freight forwarder nominated  
by the Customer when placing the transport order. The Supplier is in  
these cases also responsible for packing, marking, labelling, etc. in  
compliance with the regulation relevant to the mode(s) of transport  
used.  
4.5    If the Customer informs the Supplier that following the initial transport  
another transport with a different mode of transport is scheduled, the  
Supplier will also follow the relevant legal requirements concerning dan -  
gerous goods with regard to such on -going transport.  
4.6     Transfer of title shall be upon delivery or acceptance by the Customer,  
as the case may be.  
 
5. Payment, Invoices  
5.1      Unless otherwise agreed, payments shall be due and payable no later  
than 30 (thirty) days net. If payment is made within 14 (fourteen) days,  
the Customer is entitled to a 3 % (three percent) discount. The period  
for payment shall commence as soon as any delivery or service is com -  
pleted and a correctly issued invoice is received.   
5.2      The order number as well as the number of each individual item shall  
be detailed in invoices. Insofar as any such details are omitted, in -  
voices shall not be payable. Copies of invoices shall be marked as du -  
plicates.  
5.3    Insofar as the Supplier is required to provide material testing, test rec -  
ords or quality control documents or any other documentation, such  
shall be a part of the requirements of the completeness of the delivery  
or performance. A discount shall also be allowed if the Customer sets  
off or withholds any payments to a reasonable extent on account of any  
deficiency.  
5.4      Payment does not constitute an acknowledgement that the correspond - ing 
delivery or services were provided in accordance with the contract.  
 
6.  Inspection upon receipt  
6.1    The Customer shall immediately upon receipt at the named place of  
destination examine whether a delivery corresponds to the quantity and  
type of products ordered and whether there are any external recogniza -  
ble transportation damage or other obvious deficiencies.  
 
 
 
 
 
Condi tions of Purchase  
Status: April 2025  
 
6.2      Should the Customer discover any deficiency in the course of these  
inspections or at any later stage, it shall inform the Supplier of such  
deficiency.  
6.3   Complaints may be raised within one month of delivery of a product or  
performance, and insofar as deficiencies are not discovered until com -  
missioning, processing or first use, within one month of detection.  
6.4   In this regard the Customer shall have no other duties to the Supplier  
other than the duties of inspection and notification above.  
5.4    Payment does not constitute an acknowledgement that the correspond - ing 
delivery or services were provided in accordance with the contract.  
 
6..Inspection upon receipt  
6.1      The Customer shall immediately upon receipt at the named place of  
destination examine whether a delivery corresponds to the quantity and  
type of products ordered and whether there are any external recogniza -  
ble transportation damage or other obvious deficiencies.  
6.2      Should the Customer discover any deficiency in the course of these  
inspections or at any later stage, it shall inform the Supplier of such  
deficiency.  
6.3      Complaints may be raised within one month of delivery of a product or  
performance, and insofar as deficiencies are not discovered until com -  
missioning, processing or first use, within one month of detection.  
6.4  In this regard the Customer shall have no other duties to the Supplier  
other than the duties of inspection and notification above.  
 
7.   Warranty  
7.1    If deficiencies are identified before or during the transfer of risk or during  
the warranty period provided for in section 7.8 or 7.9, the Supplier must  
at its own expense and at the discretion of the Customer either repair  
the deficiency or provide re -performance of services or replacement of  
deliveries (= rectification). This provision also applies to deliveries sub -  
ject to inspection by sample tests. The discretion of the Customer shall  
be exercised fairly and reasonably.  
7.2      Should the Supplier fail to rectify (i. e. repair or replacement) any defi -  
ciency within a reasonable time period set by the Customer, the Cus -  
tomer is entitled to:  
7.2.1   cancel the contract in whole or in part without being subject to any lia -  
bility for damages; or  
7.2.2   demand a reduction in price; or  
7.2.3   undertake itself any repair at the expense of the Supplier or re -perfor -  
mance of services or replacement of deliveries or arrange for such to  
be done; and  
7.2.4   claim damages in lieu of performance.  
For the purposes of establishing the timeliness of rectification, the rele -  
vant point in time is the date of receipt at the place of destination.  
7.3      The rights according to section 7.2 may be exercised without further  
deadline if the Customer has a strong particular interest in immediate  
rectification in order to avoid any liability of its own for delay or for other  
reasons of urgency and it is not reasonable for the Customer to request  
the Supplier to rectify the deficiency within a reasonable time period.  
The legal provisions on the dispensability of setting a deadline remain  
unaffected hereby.  
7.4      The above -mentioned rights shall expire one year from the date of no -  
tification of the deficiency but in no instance before the expiry of the  
warranty periods set out in this section.  
7.5      Additional or other statutory rights are not affected hereby.  
7.6    If the Supplier provides subsequent performance or repairs, the war -  
ranty periods set out in section 7.8 and 7.9 shall begin to run once  
again.  
7.7      Notwithstanding the transfer of risk regarding delivery, the Supplier  
shall bear the costs and risk related to the rectification (e. g. return  
costs, costs of transport, costs of de - and re -installation).  
7.8      The warranty period for deficiencies of material is three years, insofar  
as no statutory provisions provide longer periods.  
7.9      The warranty period for deficiencies in title is five years, insofar as no  
statutory provisions provide longer periods.  
7.10    For deliveries not involving installation or commissioning, the warranty  
period begins to run with receipt at the place of destination named by  
the Customer. For deliveries involving installation, commissioning or  
services, the warranty period begins to run with acceptance by the Cus -  
tomer. Upon delivery to locations where the Customer is operating out -  
side its premises, the warranty period begins with the acceptance by  
the end customer, in no case later than one year after transfer of risk.  
 
8.        Supplier’s Duty to Verify and to Inform  
8.1      The Supplier is obliged to examine components such as, e.g. raw ma -  
terial, provided by the Customer or provided by the Supplier’s suppliers,  
manufacturers or other third parties at the time of receipt of such com -  
ponents as to whether these components show any obvious or hidden  
defects. In case any defects are discovered in the course of such in -  
spections, the Supplier shall immediately inform its suppliers or – in the  
case the components are provided by the Customer – inform the Cus -  
tomer.  
8.2     It is essential that the products are delivered free of any third -party  
rights. Thus the Supplier is under a duty to verify title and inform the  
Customer of any possible conflicting industrial and intellectual property  rights. Any breach of such duty is subject to the normal statutory limita -  
tion period.  
 
9.        Quality Management, Subcontracting to Third Parties  
9.1      The Supplier shall maintain a quality management system (e.g. accord -  
ing to DIN EN ISO 9001).  
9.2      Subcontracting to third parties shall not take place without the prior writ -  
ten consent of the Customer and entitles the Customer to cancel the  
contract in whole or in part and claim damages.  
 
10.      Provided Material, Information  
10.1    Material and information provided by the Customer remains the prop -  
erty of the Customer and are to be stored, labeled as property of the  
Customer and administered separately at no cost to the Customer.  
Their use is limited to the orders of the Customer only. The Supplier  
shall supply replacements in the event of reduction of value or loss, for  
which the Supplier is responsible, even in the event of simple negli -  
gence. This also applies to the transfer of allocated material.  
10.2    Any processing or transformation of the material and information shall  
take place for the Customer. The Customer shall immediately become  
owner of the new or transformed product. Should this be impossible for  
legal reasons, the Customer and the Supplier hereby agree that the  
Customer shall be the owner of the new product at all times during the  
processing or transformation. The Supplier shall keep the new product  
safe for the Customer at no extra cost and in so doing exercise the duty  
of care of a merchant.  
 
11.      Tools, Patterns, Samples, Confidentiality  
11.1    Any  tools,  patterns,  samples,  models,  profiles,  drawings,  standard  
specification sheets, printing templates and materials provided by the  
Customer or made for the Customer, as well as any materials derived  
there from, shall not be made available to any third party nor used for  
any other purpose than those contractually agreed except with the prior  
written consent of the Customer. Such materials shall be protected  
against unauthorized access or use. Subject to any further rights the  
Customer may demand that such materials be returned if the Supplier  
breaches these duties.  
11.2    The Supplier shall treat as confidential the knowledge and findings, doc -  
uments, terms of reference, business processes or other information  
that it receives from or about the Customer in the context of performing  
the deliveries and services, as well as the conclusion of the contract  
and any results, with regard to third parties - and shall keep the same  
confidential beyond the term of the contract – for as long as and insofar  
as such information has not become publicly known by legal means or  
the Customer has not consented in writing to its transfer in the individual  
case. The Supplier shall make confidential information available only to  
those employees who need the information for the fulfillment of their  
duties and shall ensure that such employees are also subject to a duty  
to treat such information as confidential. The Supplier shall use this in -  
formation exclusively for the purpose of performing the deliveries and  
services. Insofar as the Customer agrees to any subcontracting to a  
third party, such third party shall agree to such terms in writing.  
12.      Assignment of Claims  
Any assignment of any claim is only allowed with the prior written ap -  
proval of the Customer.  
 
13.      Right to Terminate and Cancel  
13.1  In addition to any rights provided by law to withdraw from or cancel a  
contract, the Customer may cancel the contract in whole or in part in  
case (a) the Supplier is in delay with its delivery or service and such  
delay – despite a corresponding reminder by the Customer - persists  
for more than two weeks after receipt of such reminder or in case (b)  
that adherence to the contract by the Customer cannot reasonably be  
expected from the Customer because of a reason attributable to the  
Supplier and taking into consideration the circumstances of the case  
and both parties` interests. This might, in particular, apply in case of an  
actual or possible deterioration of the Supplier’s financial situation thus  
threatening the due fulfillment of the Supplier’s obligations under the  
contract.  
13.2    The Customer may also terminate the contract in case insolvency pro -  
ceedings or similar proceedings in relation to the assets of the Supplier  
are applied for or commenced.  
13.3     In case of a termination by the Customer the Customer may continue  
to utilize existing facilities, deliveries or services already performed by  
the Supplier in exchange for reasonable payment.  
 
14.     Code of Conduct for Siemens Energy Suppliers, Security in the  
Supply Chain  
14.1    The Supplier is obliged to comply with the laws of the applicable legal 
system(s). In particular, the Supplier will not engage, actively or passively, nor 
directly or indirectly in any form of bribery, in any violation of basic human rights of 
employees or any child labor and the Supplier shall observe the stipulations of the 
German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains 
(Lieferkettensorg - faltspflichtengesetz, LkSG). Moreover, the Supplier will take 
responsibility for the health and safety of its employees and shall fulfill the 
applicable minimum wage requirements. By acting in accordance with the 
applicable environmental laws, the Supplier shall take adequate measures to avoid 
 
 
 
Condi tions of Purchase  
Status: April 2025  
the deployment of so -called conflict minerals and shall create transparency over the 
origin of raw materials. The Supplier shall provide a protected grievance 
mechanism for its own employees to report possible violations of this Code of 
Conduct and will use reasonable efforts to promote this Code of Conduct among its 
subcontractors. Supplier shall be obliged to duly document its compliance with the 
Code of Conduct. Customer and its representatives or a third party appointed by 
the Customer and reasonably acceptable to Supplier shall be entitled (but not 
obliged) to conduct – also at Supplier’s premises – inspections in order to verify 
Supplier’s compliance with the contractual obligations, in particular with the Code of 
Conduct. Any such inspection may only be conducted in accordance with the 
applicable data protection law and shall neither unreasonably interfere with 
Suppliers' business activities nor violate any of Suppliers' confidentiality 
agreements with third parties. Supplier shall reasonably cooperate in any inspection 
to be conducted. Supplier shall immediately initiate any remedial actions if it detects 
any violation of the Code of Conduct by itself or its subcontractors and shall 
promptly inform Customer of any such violation and the remedial action if and to the 
extent such breach affects the contract.  
14.2    The Supplier shall provide the necessary organizational instructions  
and take measures, particularly with regard to the following security:  
premises security, packaging and transport, business partner, person -  
nel and information - in order to guarantee the security in the supply  
chain according to the requirements of respective internationally recog -  
nized initiatives based on the WCO SAFE Framework of Standards  
(e. g. AEO, C -TPAT). The Supplier shall protect the goods and services  
provided to the Customer or provided to third parties designated by the  
Customer against unauthorized access and manipulation. The Supplier  
shall only deploy reliable personnel for those goods and services and  
shall obligate any sub -suppliers to take equivalent security measures.  
14.3  In addition to other rights and remedies the Customer may have, the  
Customer may terminate the contract in case of breach of the obliga -  
tions under section 14 by the Supplier. However, provided that the Sup -  
plier’s breach of contract is capable of remedy, the Customer’s right to  
terminate is subject to the proviso that such breach has not been rem -  
edied by the Supplier within a reasonable grace period set by the Cus -  
tomer.  
 
15.      Product Conformity, Product Related Environmental Protection  
including Substance Declaration, Dangerous Goods, Occupa -  
tional Health and Safety  
15.1    Should the Supplier deliver products, to which product -related statutory  
and legal requirements apply in view of their placing on the market and  
further marketing in the European Economic Area or to which corre -  
sponding requirements apply regarding other countries notified by the  
Customer to the Supplier, then the Supplier must ensure compliance of  
the products with these requirements at the time of transfer of risk. Fur -  
thermore, the Supplier must ensure that all documents and information  
which are necessary to provide the proof of conformity of products with  
the respective requirements can be furnished immediately to the Cus -  
tomer upon request.  
15.2    Should the Supplier deliver products, substances of which are set out

time of the order or which are subject to statutorily imposed substance  
restrictions and/or information requirements (e. g. REACH, RoHS), the  
Supplier shall declare such substances and provide information as re -  
quested in the web database BOMcheck ( www.BOMcheck.net )  no later  
than the date of first delivery of products. With respect to statutorily im -  
posed substance restrictions the foregoing shall only apply to laws

tomer or at the place of destination named by the Customer.  
15.3    Should the delivery contain goods which – according to international  
regulations – are classified as dangerous goods, the Supplier will inform

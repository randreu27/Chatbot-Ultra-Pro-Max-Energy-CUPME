Contact us Highlights of the SGT6-2000E gas turbine Best-in-class fleet reliability The extensive fleet operating experience of the SGT6-2000E lets  you benefit from best-in-class fleet reliability of > 99%. Its robust turbine design is continuously enhanced by high-performance upgrades. Excellent operational flexibility Thanks to its fast start-up capability, you will achieve full load in only about 10 min. With its fast load change capability, in turn, you will meet the most stringent grid requirements for optimal frequency stabilization. Superior fuel flexibility The SGT6-2000E offers dual-fuel capability and excellent fuel flexibility: It can be fired with low calorific gases or gases containing CO₂, H₂S and N₂, as well as with crude oil and other liquid fuels with high viscosity. The engine, equipped with DLE burners, is capable to burn up to 30 vol% of hydrogen (H 2 ). It provides reliable start-up and changeover between fuels. The automatic changeover from the primary to the secondary fuel can be carried out at reduced base load. Engineered for extreme climates This robust engine is suitable for a wide range of ambient conditions such as cold climates, hot and dry or dusty environments. For hot and dry conditions, we offer these options to increase your power output: An evaporative cooler or an inlet air chiller with heat exchangers to avoid performance degradation A Wet Compression (WetC) system to enhance turbine performance by reducing compressor inlet temperatures and increasing the mass flow throughout the turbine Excellent serviceability The SGT6-2000E is designed for easy maintenance to reduce outage times: Rotor de-stacking/re-stacking on site Blades can be individually replaced without rotor lifting Vane carriers can be removed without rotor lifting Minor inspections can be done through the spacious combustion chambers Core engine Package solutions Power plants Service Fuels Emissions Ingenious design to the core The SGT6-2000E core engine has a horizontally split casing and two walk-in combustion chambers, equipped with individually replaceable ceramic tiles. This design allows a hot-gas-path inspection without cover lift. The 17-stage axial-flow compressor with variable-pitch inlet guide vanes enhances peak load operation and supports frequency stabilization. The robust 4-stage turbine incorporates the latest blade and vane design for stable, improved performance. The hybrid burners are able to operate in premix and diffusion mode with natural gas, fuel oil and special fuels such as heavy oil and refinery residues. The Low-NOₓ combustion system, single-digit NOₓ emissions can be achieved. Superior fuel flexibility Due to its external silo-type combustion chambers, the engine even runs on ash-forming fuels like crude or heavy-fuel oil (HFO). Excellent part load performance High part load efficiency and quick load changes due to fast-acting variable inlet guide vane. Short installation times The SGT6-2000E gas turbine package consists of the core turbine, the generator (SGen6-100A-2P) and auxiliary systems. It offers you a standardized basic design with options geared to your specific requirements. By using standard components and preassembly or prepackaging we achieve short installation times, with staggered delivery and early shipment of main components. We group subsystems and install them in separate auxiliary packages to minimize field assembly.. SGT5-2000E package layout Designed for short installation times, all package piping is prefabricated to minimize pipe cleaning and welding on site. Package footprint: Length: 47 m (155 ft) Width: 30 m (100 ft) GT enclosure height: 9 m (30 ft) Package auxiliaries The package auxiliaries include the air intake system, exhaust gas system, power control center, instrumentation and control, fuel and lube oil system and electrical systems. The SGT6-2000E fires up We offer both simple cycle and combined cycle power plants with or without cogeneration. SGT6-2000E-based combined cycle plants (SCC6-2000E) have a fast-start capability. You can achieve combined cycle base load within only 8.5 min for start-up until full load with a start-up gradient of 27 MW/min. High load gradients allow for fast load changes. With excellent peaking capability, and high part load efficiency complying with emission regulations down to lower part load, this is your profitable solution for competitive energy markets with fluctuating power demand. SGT6-2000E simple cycle power plant SGT6-2000E simple cycle power plants are your ideal solution for peak load or standby. They can be commissioned and installed fast and cost-efficiently. The plants enable quick start-ups and fast load-following. SGT6-2000E multi-shaft combined cycle plants The SCC6-2000E multi-shaft combined cycle plants are based on one, two or more SGT5-2000E gas turbine packages and a steam turbine. Optimized for short outages to maximize availability We offer Long Term Programs (LTP) , overhaul services, field service, spare parts, reconditioning of components and modernization upgrades. Whether scheduled service or short-term support, our specialists are there for you, on-site all over the world. The SGT6-2000E generator package is optimized for short outages. Multiple borescopic inspection ports allow inspection of compressor and turbine blades without lifting covers. The heat shields on the combustion chamber are individually replaceable. All stationary and moving blades and all stationary blade and vane carriers can be replaced individually with the rotor in place. Service-friendly design reduces maintenance outage time The built disc-type rotor with radial Hirth serrations and one central tie bolt allows for on-site de-stacking and repair. Horizontal casing joints ensure good accessibility of all components. Easy combustion chamber on-site maintenance Manholes at the combustion chambers permit easy access for inspection and maintenance activities. Fuel flexibility matters The SGT6-2000E offers outstanding fuel flexibility: It burns natural gas, LNG, syngas, blast furnace gas, biogas, ethane, propane, condensate, distillate oil, heavy and crude oils, biodiesel, alcohols, naphtha or kerosene. The gas turbine can also be fired with low-calorific gases or gases containing CO 2 , H 2 S and N 2 ,or with up to 30 vol% of hydrogen (H 2 ), as well as with crude oil and other liquid fuels with high viscosity. Robust combustion system with silo chamber The large-space silo combustion ch­ambers enable the combustion of fuels with high viscosity. Fast fuel switchover Quick online fuel changeover from gas to oil and vice versa enhances operational flexibility.

Portfolio Elements
3 x SGT-800 gas turbine in combined cycle with a steam turbine for
electricity and district heating (total efficiency 92,5%)
Customer Challenge/Driver
By2025 , all district heating in Gothenburg, Sweden, will be produced
from renewable or recovered energy sources. Flexible energy
solutions are needed to secure the region's power supply.
Customer Benefit
Capable to operate on liquid green fuel , enhancing fuel flexibility
for fossil-free power and heat
Demonstrates gas turbines as a viable option for carbon-neutral
backup andgrid stabilization
Supports the integration of intermittent renewable sources like
solar and wind, ensuring a balanced future energy system.
Solution
Göteborg Energi andSiemens Energy in long-term cooperation for
fossil-free cogeneration (i.e. operation on cost-effective green fuels)
Increased fuel flexibility by development of next generation dual-fuel
green burners
Use of additive manufacturing to speed up R&D process
Successful operation verified on Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO)
at Rya CHP in November 2021 supported by Swedish Energy Agency

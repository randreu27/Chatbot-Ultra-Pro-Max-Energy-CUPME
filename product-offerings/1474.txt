 
 Earnings Release  Q3 FY 2022  
April  1 to June  30, 2022 
Munich, Germany , August 8 , 2022 – Siemens Energy today announced  its results for the third  quarter of fiscal year 2022 that ended June  30, 202 2. 
Gas and Power resilient while SGRE again weighing down Group results  – 
Major initiatives taken to shape Siemens Energy for the energy transitio n 
“Our Gas and Power business has once again delivered in the recent quarter and thus proven its resilience. Despite unprecedent ed macroeconomic 
challenges, we see sharply higher order volumes with growing demand for our technologies to facilitate the energy transition. On  top of maneu-
vering the daily operations, the Gas and Power team started to set the course for a new organizational structure aim ed at significantly reducing 
complexity and shortening the decision -making processes. And yet there are also again drawbacks  in the third quarter. Siemens Gamesa continued 
to experience high losses in a challenging market environment . The poor performance at  Siemens Gamesa had a negative impact on our overall 
results. We expect the new management at Siemens Gamesa now to implement a rigorous turnaround plan. During the quarter we la unched a 
cash tender offer for the outstanding minority shares in Siemens Game sa with the intention to delist and fully integrate its operations ”, says Chris-
tian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy AG.  
• In the r ecent quarter , Gas and Power (GP) achieved  another  solid performance despite unfavorable geopolitical and macroeconom ic factors 
which continue to impact Siemens Energy’s business development overall. While  both segments faced strong headwinds from  increased material 
and logistic costs as well as supply chain constraints , GP demonstrated resilien ce due to stringent  measures taken based on its  operational 
excellence  program . 
• Siemens Energy started the restructuring of its business activities in Russia  in the third quarter which burdened the result of GP by  €0.2bn , 
reported as strategic portfolio decisions un der special items.  These restructuring activities are expected to be concluded by end of this fiscal year 
without further significant financial impact.  
• Orders continued to be strong with growth of 60.0% year -over-year on a comparable basis  (excluding curre ncy translation and portfolio effects ). 
Both segments contributed to the increase, resulting in third quarter orders of €9. 8bn driving order backlog to a nother  record  of €93. 4bn. 
• Revenue of €7.3bn was down by 4. 7% on a comparable basis  as growth at GP was more than offset by a decline at Siemens Gamesa Renewable 
Energy ( SGRE ). 
• Despite burdens from supply chain constraints,  GP reported a positive Adjusted EBITA before special items of €212m nearly on prior -year quarter’s 
level . Due to  the high loss at SGRE , Siemens Energy ’s Adjusted EBITA before special items was negative  €131m (Q3 FY 2021: positive €54m). 
Special items amounted to  negative €298m (Q3  FY 2021: negative €178m)  largely related to the  restructuring of business in Russia . Adjusted 
EBITA for Siemens Energy came in at  negative € 429m (Q 3 FY 2021: negative  €124m). 
• Accordingly, Siemens Energy’s Net loss was €533m (Q3 FY 2021:  negative €307m). Corresponding basic earnings per share (EPS) were  negative 
€0.54 (Q3 FY 2021: negative  €0.32) . 
• Free cash flow pre tax decreased t o negative  €25m (Q3 FY 2021: positive €328m) driven by SGRE while GP exceeded  the strong prior -year 
quarter ’s level . 
• On May 21, 2022, Siemens Energy AG announced a voluntary cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares in Siemens Games a Renewable 
Energy S.A., i.e., approximately 32.9 percent of the share capital, which Siemens Energy AG does not already own. The m inority shareholders 
will be offered €18.05 per share in cash. Following a successful closing of the transaction, Siemens Energy AG intends to pursue a delisting of 
Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A.  from the Spanish stock exchanges, where it currently t rades as a member of the IBEX 35 index.  In June 
2022 , a €1.15bn cash deposit  was pledged in favor of  the Spanish National Securities Market Commission which reduced  Siemens Energy’s Net 
cash position at the end of recent quarter.  
• Although further negative effects associated with geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges cannot be ruled out, management s till expects to 
achieve its outlook given for GP and Siemens Energy  excluding  effects from lost revenue in connection with business in Russia for comparable 
revenue growth . Net loss of Siemens Energy in fiscal year 2022 is expected to exceed prior year’s net loss approximately by the impact from  the 
restructuring of business in Russia  reported as special item.

1 Comparable basis: Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects  • Strong order development  was supported by large orders both at GP 
and SGRE  and mainly driven by the development in the reporting re-
gion Europe, C.I.S., Middle East and Africa  where orders nearly dou-
bled . 
• Book -to-bill ratio was 1 .35. Order backlog rose to a new record  of 
€93.4bn (March  31, 202 2: €89.3bn) partly  benefitting from curren cy 
translation effects . 
• Moderate  decline in r evenue was driven by continued challenges and 
supply chain constraints  at SGRE . 
• Service revenue came in close to  prior-year quarter ’s level . 
• On a nominal basis , orders and revenue rose 65 .4% and 0.2%, re-
spectively . 
• Adjusted EBITA  was negative in both  segments. In GP, this was driven 
by sharply higher  impacts from special items year -over-year.  The de-
cline in SGRE reflected continued supply chain constraints and oper-
ational challenges . 
• Impacts from s pecial items were sharply up year-over -year and re-
lated to the restructuring of GP’s business in Russia  and higher re-
structuring and integration costs  at SGRE . 
• Adjusted EBITA before special items was negative because of SGRE 
while GP was nearly on prior -year quarter’s level.  
• Free cash flow pre tax came in negative,  driven by the loss at SGRE , 
while GP delivered  a strong  contribution slightly above  prior -year 
quarter’s level . 
• During the quarter, provisions for pensions and similar obligations 
decreased  from € 725m as of March  31, 202 2 to €623m as of June  
30, 202 2 driven by higher discount rates .

1 Comparable basis: Excluding currency translation and portfolio effects  • Strong o rder g rowth across all businesses  and reporting regions was 
supported by a sharply increased volume from large orders.  
• GP reported a Book -to-bill ratio of 1.31. This  result ed in an order back-
log of €5 9.6bn again exceeding previous  quarter -end record . 
• Revenue grew slightly despite the sanctions against Russia and con-
tinued  supply chain constraints.  
• On a nominal basis, orders and revenue increased by 4 2.8% and 
6.3%, respectively . 
• Adjusted EBITA of GP decreased mainly due to  the impact from the 
restructuring of business in Russia  totaling € 0.2bn . In addition, the 
result was impacted by expected supply chain related effects and 
higher material prices in the short -cycle business.  
• Impacts from special items sharply increased year-over-year related 
to the restructuring of business in Russia . 
• Adjusted EBITA before special items was nearly on prior -year quar-
ter’s level and, together with respective margin, within expectations . 
• Free cash flow pre tax was strong and slightly above  prior -year quar-
ter’s level , supported by advance payments from customers related 
to the strong order development  which more than offset higher out-
flows for inventories .

 • Orders in the SGRE segment more than doubled primarily due to two 
large offshore orders in the United Kingdom and Germany totaling 
more than  €1.8bn . 
• Book -to-bill ratio of SGRE came in at 1.45 leading to a  record  order 
backlog of €3 4.0bn at quarter -end.  
• Revenue was significantly  down compared to  prior -year quarter’s 
level  due to  supply chain constraints in the wind turbines business 
and continued  operational problems . The service business was 
slightly down  year-over-year. 
• On a nominal basis, segment’s orders increased  by 131.8%, and rev-
enue decreased by 9.9%. 
• Adjusted EBITA decreased compared to prior -year quarter due to 
lower  volume, higher material and logistic costs and operational 
problems; recent quarter was affected b y known challenges with the 
5.X platform and increased costs mainly driven by  component fail-
ures and repairs in  already installed onshore platforms.  
• Negative Free cash flow pre tax sharply increased  year-over -year, 
driven by the lower result  and also impacted by cash outflows related 
to previously recorded  provisions for losses on sales contracts .

segment’s Real Estate Portfolio, formerly shown under Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements, is 
assigned to the correspondent segment. Rel ated prior year information has been reclassified to conform to 
the current year presentation.  
 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements includes items 
which management does not consider to be indicative of the segments ’ 
performance – mainly  centrally carried pension expenses , Treasury ac-
tivities  and other central items as well as eliminations.   
 
 Earnings Release Q3  FY 20 22 | Siemens Energy  
5 Outlook  
For the GP segment  in fiscal year 2022, we still expect comparable revenue growth (excluding currency translatio n and portfolio effects) and 
Adjusted EBITA margin before special items towards the low end of the guidance range s of positive 1%  to positive 5% and positive 4.5%  to positive 
6.5% , respectively. However, f or the comparable revenue growth, effects related  to the  current market conditions in  Russia  are excluded . For fiscal 
year 2023, we target an Adjusted EBITA margin before special items unchanged in a range between positive 6% and positive 8%.  
According to  SGRE , for fiscal year 2022, the company now is working to achieve  a comparable revenue growth  near  the low end  of the previous 
target  range of negative 9%  to negative 2% , and an EBIT margin pre PPA (purchase price allocation) and integration a nd restructuring costs of circa 
negative 5.5% . 
Consequently, for Siemens Energy  we expect results still towards the low end of the guidance ranges for comparable revenue development (neg-
ative 2% to positive 3% but excluding Russia -related effects) and Adjusted EBITA margin before special items (positive 2% to positive 4%). We now 
expect Net loss of Siemens Energy in fiscal year 2022 to exceed prior year’s Net loss approximately by the impact from the restructuring of business 
in Russia repo rted as special item.  We still assume Free cash flow pre tax to be in a range of a positive mid -triple -digit million €.  
This guidance assumes no further major financial impacts from COVID -19 on our business activity and excludes charges related to legal an d regu-
latory matters  including further negative effects from the war in Ukraine and its economic consequences .

crankshaft by dowel and hub arrangement complete with pressure relief valve for cold start protection and main bearing pressure 
regulating valve.   
     7.2  Oil Filter - Oil filter is frame full-flow and uses a single coreless disposable 
type element.  The core post is integral to the housing.  The filter 
comes with 0-30 psig, frame mo unted liquid filled differential 
pressure gauge.  External oil piping downstream of the filter is 
316/316L Stainless Steel. 
      -Filter Rating:  B[15] ≥200 (Minimum Particle Removal Efficiency of 
99.5” for 15 micron particles) in accordance with ISO 16889 
      -Cartridge Collapse Rating:  150 psig 
 
          Options - - Dual oil filter with transfer valve. (Shipped loose).      - Stainless steel pipi ng upstream of standard filter. 
 
    7.3  Oil Cooler - Fixed bundle shell and tube watercooled oil cooler.  Steel shell 
(housing), carbon steel tube sheets welded to shell, 4 pass design 
with cast iron bonnets, seamless ad miralty tubes 25 BWG, 3/8".

      8.0 Crankshaft Seal Assembly - Prevents oil leakage from frame, non-pres sure containing design.  
Consists of a weather seal pressed into frame end cover around 
crankshaft.  On 2 and 4 thro w frames, the crankshaft 
counterweight inboard of seal acts as a slinger throwing oil back 
into frame.  On 6 throw frames, there is a split slinger ring clamped 
on crankshaft inboard of oil seal for this same purpose. 
 
     9.0 Tool Kit - Consisting of crosshead nut wrench, piston rod entering sleeve 
and piston nut adapter (if applicable).  One set provided per frame.

  10.0 Paint - All castings are shot bl ast, chipped and cleaned.  Internal surfaces 
of frame, frame extensions and di stance pieces are painted with 
an oil-proof white primer.  All external surfaces are painted with a 
red oxide primer.   
   11.0 Preservation for Shipment - Lubricated Cylinder Applications - For domestic (North 
America) applications, all internal components within the cylinder 
and frame are coated with a rust preventative light oil.  For overseas shipment or extended storage (6+ months), the 
compressor frame and cylinder internals are coated with a heavy 
oil.  Critical components within the cylinder such as piston and 
rods and valves are removed and boxed separately for better 
preservation.  It is recommended that most of the heavy preservative be removed prior to start-up.  Special Note:   If the 
compressor is a domestic shipment, but the package is export, 
and the packager will be run testing the package in house, it is then up to the packager to insure overseas preservation measures 
are taken on the compressor prior to overseas shipment. 
      Non-Lube Cylinder Applications - For domestic (North America) 
applications, aluminum paint is used in the cylinder gas 
passageway and heads as a corrosi on preventative.  On export 
shipments or extended storage, the gas passages and heads will 
be sprayed with a mineral rust preventative after the aluminum 
paint is applied.   Pressure, partition packing and oil wiper rings are removed and placed into a greaseproof, waterproof, flexible 
barrier material followed by an outerwrap.  Export or extended 
storage also require the piston and rod assembly to be removed for shipment.  Piston and rider rings are to be removed and 
packed like the packing rings mentioned earlier.  Piston and rod 
are sprayed with a fingerprint neut ralizer, then the piston, rod and 
jamnut are spayed with a rust pr eventative and finally wrapped like 
the packing rings mentioned above.

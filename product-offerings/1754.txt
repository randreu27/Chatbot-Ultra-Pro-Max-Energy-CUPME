Globally standardiz ed design
Siemens Energy SPS 2S 550 kV dead tan k circuit breakers 
utilize the time-te sted FA spring- spring operating 
mechanism and 3AP  arc assist interr upter common to t he 
entire SPS2 portf olio.
Siemens Energy h as delivered over 160,000 breakers 
worldwide, with o ver 46,000 SPS2 circuit breakers to the US 
market alone sinc e release in 1997 .Standard features
•No TRV capacitor s necessary for b reake rs rated up to 63 kA
•Higher X/R ratio so higher reliabi lity
•2-cycle interruptin g time
•Ships with CTs and  CT covers installed
•No adjustments a nd virtually no ma intenance
Application-based customizations
•Phase synchronizing device (PSD) for reliable point-on-wave 
switching
•High seismic desi gns (per IEEE 693)
•High Altitude app lications
•Pre-insertion res istors
•Plug-and-play cont rol wiring
•Composite bushings

Renewable energy sources are only part of 
the solution as we aim for the decar -
bonization of the energy sector. It’s 
essential that we achieve Zero Global 
Warming Potential (GWP) in the 
transmission of power as well as in its 
generation.
Most switchgear still use SF6for insulation 
–a gas 24,300 times more climate -hostile 
than CO2and one which stays in the 
atmosphere for up to 1,000 years.
Recognizing the harmfulness of SF6and 
other F -gases, the EU has legislated to 
restrict their use and allows only GWP < 1 
solutions if available.
By contrast, our future -ready Blue 
portfolio, including the 3AV2 live tank 
circuit breaker, uses Zero fluorinated gases 
of any kind and has Zero harmful impact 
on the environment.Zero SF6–
just clean air
The sustainable, non -toxic alternative to
F-gases is clean air. This is the only way to 
achieve zero GWP.
The 3AV2 live tank circuit breaker 
combines vacuum switching technology 
with clean air insulation. It operates with 
Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any 
kind, with Zero toxic decomposition 
products and Zero safety requirements 
during handling and maintenance.
The clean air used –consisting of 80% 
nitrogen and 20% oxygen, cleaned and 
free of humidity –can be released into the 
atmosphere with Zero harmful effects to 
people or the environment.
At the same time, the 3AV2 maintains the 
highest standards of technical 
performance and reliability, together with 
low lifecycle costs. 
This proven technology has already been 
introduced into power transmission 
networks delivering up to 145 kV, and the 
application range is now being extended 
to levels of 420 kV and above.Clean air Blue Vacuum technology

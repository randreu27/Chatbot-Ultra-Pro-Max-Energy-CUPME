Aparticular highlight during this quarter was the DAX
inclusion onMarch 22,lessthan sixmonths after welisted
ontheFrankfurt Stock Exchange .
Tobecome aleader intheenergy transformation isour
mission and weshowcased ourhydrogen capabilities atour
“Hydrogen Day” onMarch 19.More than 500participants
followed theevent online .You canfindfurther information

BLUE GREENProduction capacity (Mt p.a.)Inorder tocombat global warming governments around
theworld have been stepping upprograms tocontain
CO2emissions .Beyond incentives to promote
investments inrenewables, hydrogen has become a
focus area.Hence, weare seeing arapid rise in
hydrogen capacity .Just looking atthe announced
capacity additions forclean (green and blue) hydrogen
wearelooking atarise from 2.3million tons in2019
to6.7million tons in2020 (see graphic) .
The projection considers two different sources of
hydrogen .Blue hydrogen isgenerated using non-
renewable energy sources (e.g.natural gas), with
carbon capture technologies that reduce CO2emissions .
Green hydrogen isproduced using renewable energy
sources (e.g.solar, wind) withzero carbon emissions .
Given therapid riseincapacity weexpect adecrease in
green hydrogen cost, which willbeakey factor for
hydrogen toproliferate intomore sectors oftheeconomy .2020: 6.7
2019: 2.3

SBTi hasverified onascientific basis thatSiemensEnergy’s CO2reduction targets comply with the
Paris Agreement and thus contribute tolimiting global warming totheextent stipulated inthe
agreement .
Akeyelement ofSiemens Energy's sustainability program, isitstarget tobecome climate -neutral by
2030 (scope 1&2).The company aims toachieve this bytransitioning itsown electricity
consumption to100%green energy by2023 aswellasinvesting initsown operations .
Moreover, by2030 ,greenhouse gasemissions ofproducts (scope 3)intheGas andPower segment aretobecutbyjust

increased efficiency ofitsproducts .
Ouroutlook forfiscal year 2021
Against thebackground ofthebusiness development in
thefirsthalfofthefiscal year coupled with greater visibility
ontheremainder ofthefiscal year, werefine ouroutlook
forthenominal revenue growth forSiemens Energy and
both segments .Ouroriginal outlook included awider range
fortheexpected growth rate reflecting ahigh level of
uncertainty atthattime regarding factors, amongst others,
theglobal COVID -19pandemic .
We continue to expect global macroeconomic
development toremain subdued fortheremaining fiscal
year 2021 ,with risks particularly related togeopolitical and
geo-economic uncertainties .Our markets tend tohave a
limited effect toeconomic cycles and our businesses,
especially ourservice business, ischaracterized byahigh
level ofresilience .
This guidance continues toassume limited financial impact
from COVID -19during fiscal year 2021 .Nevertheless, we
observe with concern the resurgence ofthe globalCOVID -19 pandemic and measures imposed by
authorities .We continue tomonitor the pandemic
situation and evaluate appropriate measures asit
pertains toourguidance .

Dear Sir or Madam
Scope/Applicability: All Suppliers providing Engine/Package Parts & Tooling into the UK Warehouse  for Siemens Power
Generation Services - Distributed Generation Aero derivative Gas Turbines Division; Industrial Turbine Company (UK) Ltd.
Introduction:
Industrial Turbine Company (UK) Ltd will be consolidating warehousing activities with those of another Siemens business
located in Lincoln, and as a result will no longer be operating from the DB Schenker Warehouse (Nuneaton).
The new facility, known as the Global Service Operations Centre (GSOC), is a 7,000sqm high-tech facility, which has taken
11 months to complete, and was officially opened on the 24th April 2018 by Thorbjoern Fors, Siemens CEO for PS DO.
GSOC will manage parts and services to support the Siemens global network and is currently home to around 16,000 parts.
In August 2018 this will increase by a further 15,000 parts, as the Aero derivative Gas Turbine product line formally transfers
to the advanced warehouse operations and spare core storage management facility.
Action Required:
Currently Suppliers deliver to our Warehouse in Nuneaton â€“ c/o DB Schenker. As of 16th July 2018  all deliveries for
Industrial Turbine (UK) Ltd (Siemens AGT) are to be delivered to the GSOC Warehouse. Existing Purchase Orders and
Schedule Agreements will not be reissued, however should the delivery date fall after the  16th July 2018, you are
requested to ensure that shipments to the new facility are made accordingly.
New Purchase Orders and Schedule Agreements circulated after the 16th of July 2018 will be issued with the new address.

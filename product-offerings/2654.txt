Clean Energy Center (CEC)
In 2015, we started operations our state-of-the-art high-pressure test fa-
cility for gas turbine combustion and components in Ludwigsfelde, near 
Berlin.
The Clean Energy Center can test combustion and turbine flows up to 100 
MWth. We provide main air, cooling water and cooling air systems, liquid 
and gaseous fuel and online fuel mixing for high fuel flexibility. The CEC houses three fully equipped, isolated test cells for combustion 
system testing: two test cells for the larger test rigs (e.g., large gas 
turbine burners) and one test cell for the smaller test rigs (e.g., industrial 
gas turbine burners). due to this setup the Clean Energy Center accurately 
duplicate almost any customer specifications, testing under realistic high 
pressure conditions, simulating a specific ambient temperature or crea-
ting the precise fuel mixture that will later be applied in the product 
application. 
All relevant key parameters such as output, efficiency, emissions, and 
flame stability are monitored, measured and analyzed.

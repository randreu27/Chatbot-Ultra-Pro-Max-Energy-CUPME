 Earnings Release  Q3 FY 202 3 
April  1 to June  30, 2023 
Munich, Germany , August 7 , 2023 – Siemens Energy  today announced  its results for the third  quarter of fiscal year 202 3 that ended June  30, 202 3. 
Serious ramp -up challenges in the wind business overshadow excellent 
performance in conventional energy business  
“Our third -quarter results demonstrate the challenges in turning around Siemens Gamesa. The strong performance of our other business  areas  
gives me confidence in our company’s ability to put businesses back on a strong footing ”, says Christian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens 
Energy AG.  
• Siemens Energy’s results of the third quarter were impacted by charges at Siemens Gamesa . These  relate mainly to quality issues of certain 
onshore platforms  as well as increased product costs and ramp -up challenges in the offshore business . 
• Siemens Energy continues to benefit from a favorable market environment. Orders of €14.9bn reflec t 54.2% growth on a c omparable basis 
(excluding currency translation and portfolio effects), primarily driven by large orders at Siemens Gamesa and Grid Technolog ies (GT). The Book -
to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) came in at 1.98 and led the order backlog to a new re cord of €109.0bn . 
• Revenue increase d by 8.0% on a comparable basis to €7.5bn. 
• Profit before Special items of Siemens Energy was negative with €2,0 48m (Q3 FY 2022: negative €222m) driven by above mentioned charges 
at Siemens Gamesa totaling €2.2bn. Profit before Special items at Gas Services (GS), GT, and Transformation of Industry (TI) sharply increased 
compared to the prior -year quarter, driven by continued strong operational performance . 
• Special items declined to negative €41m (Q3  FY 2022: negativ e €259m) as the prior -year quarter was heavily burdened by Russia -related 
charges . Profit for Siemens Energy was negative with €2, 089m (Q3  FY 2022: negative €481m).  
• Siemens Energy reported a Net loss of €2, 931m (Q3 FY 2022: Net loss €564m) , including negat ive tax effects from valuation allowances on 
deferred tax assets in connection with the charges at Siemens Gamesa . Cor responding basic earnings per share (EPS) were negative  €3.42 
(Q3 FY 2022: negative € 0.58). 
• Free cash flow pre tax improved to positive  €27m from negative € 25m in the prior -year quarter.  
• In light of the developments at Siemens Gamesa, management  adjust s the outlook  for Siemens Energy . Due to the aforementioned cha llenges  
at Siemens Gamesa, management now expects for Siemens Energy Group comparable revenue growth to be in a range of 9% to 11%, a Profit 
margin before Special items between negative 10% and negative 8% and  a Net loss  of around €4.5bn. Free cash flow pre tax now is expected 
up to a negative low triple -digit million € amount . Management maintains its revenue and Profit margin assumptions  for the segments GS, GT, 
and TI.

 • Orders more than doubled compared to an already strong prior -year 
quarter. This was due to a higher volume from large orders, including 
a single offshore order  worth  €2.3bn. 
• Book-to-bill ratio came in at 3.58. The  order backlog amounted to  
€39.9bn. 
• Revenue declined significant ly, mainly due to the reversal of revenue 
associated with the circumstances  mentioned below . 
• Profit before Special items was burdened by  charges totaling €2.2bn  
which include d €1.6bn related to quality issues  of certain onshore 
platforms. F ollowing a substantial increase in failure rates of certain 
wind turbine components, an extended technical re view suggested 
that significantly higher costs will be incurred than previously as-
sumed  to reach the targeted quality level . The other charges mainly 
relate to increased product costs and ramp -up challenges in the off-
shore business .

 Reconciliation to Consolidated Financial Statements includes items , 
which management does not consider to be indicative of the segments’ 
performance – mainly group management costs (management and cor-
porate functions) and other central items, Treasury activities as well as 
eliminations. Other central items include Siemens  brand fees, corporate 
services  (e.g. management of the Group’s real estate portfolio (except 
Siemens Gamesa ), which was allocated to the Gas and Power segment  
in the prior year) , corporate projects, centrally held equity interests and 
other items.  
The positive change year -over -year in Reconciliation to Consolidated Fi-
nancial Statements was mainly due to a favorable one -time effect re-
lated to a legacy power plant construction project which more than off-
set increased costs for corporate functions .

6 Outlook  
Overall a ssumptions for the segments GS, GT , and TI for fiscal year 2023 remain unchanged  as follows:  
• GS plans  to achieve  a comparable  revenue  growth  (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects)  of 10%  to 12%  and a Profit  margin  
before  Special  items  between  9% and 11%.  
• GT plans to achieve a comparable revenue growth of 12% to 14% and a Profit margin before Special items between 6% and 8%.  
• TI plans  to achieve  a comparable  revenue  growth  of 8% to 10%  and a Profit margin  before  Special  items  between  3% and 5%. 
Siemens Gamesa adjusts revenue and Profit assumptions for fiscal year 2023 and now assumes comparable revenue growth of negative 3 % to 0% 
(previously positive 6% to positive 10%) and a negative Profit before Special items around €4.3bn. In addition to the aforementioned charges , the 
assumptions  for Siemens Gamesa reflect lower profit contributions from the execution of its current order backlog mainly related to increased 
product costs and continued ramp -up challenges in the offshore activities.  
Accordingly, the fiscal year 2023  outlook for Siemens Energy had to be adjust ed. We now expect for Siemens Energy comparable revenue growth 
to be  in a range of 9% to 11% (previously 10% to 12% ) and a Profit margin before Special items between negative 10% and negative 8% (previously 
around the low end of the guidance range of positive 1% to positive 3%) . Net loss of Siemens Energy Group now is expected to be around  €4.5bn 
(previously  expected to exceed  prior  fiscal  year’s  level  of €712m  by up to a low-triple -digit  million  € amount ). We now expect  a Free cash flow pre 
tax for fiscal year 2023  up to a negative low triple -digit million € amount (previously positive up to a low triple -digit million € amount ). 
The outlook for Siemens Energy assumes no major negative financial impacts from COV ID-19 or other pandemic related events, no further deteri-
oration in the supply chain and raw material cost environment, and excludes  charges related to legal and regulatory matters.

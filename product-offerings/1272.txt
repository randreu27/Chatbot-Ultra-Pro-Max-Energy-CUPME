Excellent performance of conventional 
businesses in fiscal year 2023 overshadow ed 
by wind business  performance  
• Businesses  representing 70% of revenue  well on track to meet mid -term targets   
• Quality problems at Siemens Gamesa ringfenced, turnaround measures in progress  
• Strong growth in orders and revenue to finish with a record order backlog of €112  bn 
• Profit before Special Items of negative €2,776  million , margin at negative 8.9%  due to the 
charges in the wind business  
• Structure for guarantee facility  to support strong order growth  agreed with  German 
government , banking partners and Siemens AG  
• Disposals under execution to strengthen balance sheet  
 
 
In a year with challenges, the excellent  performance and success of 70%  of Siemens  Energy’s 
businesses  in the fiscal year 2023 was offset  by difficulties  in the wind business. The business 
areas Gas Services, Grid Technologies and Transformation of Industry exceeded their fiscal 2023 
revenue forecasts and achieved profit margins before special items in line with or above guidance. 
Due to the enormous demand for Siemens Energy's technologies, t hese businesses are all well on 
track to reach the mid -term targets first set in September 2020 . 
 
The wind business remains a major challenge  and has led to the net loss  in 2023 . In the past 
financial year, Siemens Gamesa suffered an unexpected, se rious  setback . Charges for quality 
issues in the onshore business, increased product costs and ramp -up challenges in the offshore 
business severely impacted the  results for the fiscal year 2023  and will continue to impact the 
Group's profitability in the near to mid -term . Break -even at Siemens Gamesa is now expected in 
fiscal year 2026.  
 
However, the wind subsidiary is also making progress . The technical analysis of the quality issues 
for the  onshore platforms 4.X and 5.X  is almost complete and the results so far confirm what was Press release

communicated in August 2023. No further provisions in these fields have been made since the  
Q3 announcement . Remedial actions have been defined and mitigation and corrective actions  
are under development . Siemens Gamesa  has still suspended the commercial activities on the  
5.X platform and is defining a timeline and approach  to set out  how and when to resume sales  
with a design incorporating the respective corrective measures .  
In the offshore sector, Siemens Gamesa is focusing on ramping up its factories and  new product 
generation as well as  executing its order backlog.  Output has been significantly increased 
compared to the fiscal year 2022. To help achieve the turnaround, and return Siemens Gamesa to 
profitability, the scope of Siemens Gamesa’s activities  is currently reviewed . More details will be 
revealed on Capital Market Day on November 21.  
 
Christian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy, summarizes the fiscal year:  
"In a year of unprecedented challenges, Siemens Energy showed that turnarounds are achievable, 
with the businesses , excluding wind , meeting or exceeding their full -year targets. We are also 
seeing progress in dealing with the issues at Siemens Gamesa, and I am encouraged that the data 
from the installed onshore turbines confirm our previous findings. Our strong balance sheet 
remains a  top priority, and Siemens Energy's vital role in the energy transition will continue to 
drive our growth and success in the years ahead."  
 
 
Siemens Energy with solid results in the 2023 fiscal year  
 
Siemens Energy’s market momentum continued to be strong in the 2023 fiscal year.  
The order backlog of €112 billion reached a nother  new record, while orders at Siemens Energy 
exceeded the already high prior -year level and rose by 33.8% on a comparable basis  to 
€50.4  billion . Both Siemens Gamesa and Grid Technologies contributed strongly to this growth.   
Revenue  increased by 9.9% on a comparable basis  to €31.1  billion,  with all segments apart from 
Siemens Gamesa contributing to this growth. The Gas Services, Grid Technologies and 
Transformation of Industry all exceeded guided revenue targets for the fiscal year, which helped 
the group to meet  its guidance.   
 
Siemens Energy’s profitability was severely impacted  by the large loss at Siemens Gamesa.  
Profit  before special items  decreased to negative €2,776  million . Gas Services, Grid Technologies 
and Transformation of Industry delivered profits before Special items in line with guidance and in 
aggregate with the targets set at the first capital markets day in September 2020 .

The Profit margin before special items  of negative  8.9% was in line with the latest adjusted 
guided range of negative 10% to negative 8%.  
Free cash flow pre tax  decreased to €784 million from an exceptionally high level in the previous 
year, and was significantly better than expected. As a result, net financial debt at the end of the 
year was €0.2 billion, also much lower than expected.  
The Net loss  of Siemens Energy was € 4.588 billion.  
 
Further details and the figures for the fourth quarter can be found in the appendix at the end of

Milestones in a transformative year  
 
In fiscal year 2023 Siemens Energy had to overcome significant challenges, ranging from 
macroeconomic challenges including higher interest rates, global supply chain disruptions and the 
continuation of the war in Ukraine, as well as the technical problems and ramp up challenges at 
Siemens Gamesa. Still, Siemens Energy made major progress towards its short - and mid -term 
goals.  
 
The new operating model became operation al at the beginning of the year leading to more 
transparency  and simpler structures  with three business areas replacing the former Gas and Power 
business. The tender offer for the remaining shares of Siemens Gamesa was successfully 
refinanced with a mandatory convertible and a capital increase and finally closed in July 2023, this 
meant that Siemens Energy was able to start the integration of Siemens Gamesa into Siemens 
Energy.  
 
With its portfolio, Siemens Energy covers the entire value chain of the energy transition, making it 
one of the most important players in the market.   
 
With its Transformation of Industry  (TI) business, Siemens Energy supports industrial companies in 
reducing their carbon footprint  to meet their ESG targets . This target group alone accounts for 
30% of global emissions and about 37% of global energy consumption.  On November 8, TI 
opened its first gigawatt electrolyzer factory in Berlin, with an annual production capacity of one 
gigawatt currently, and a planned ramp -up to at least three gigawatts by 2025. With that capacity, 
around 300,000 metric tons of green hydrogen can be produced yearly, which could replace

enough fossil fuels to avoid the CO 2 emissions of a major city with app rox. 260,000 people.  With 
such numbers, the factory lays the foundations for the ramp -up of the hydrogen economy.  
 
Siemens Energy’s gas turbines are also for ming part of the energy transition. Siemens Energy 
already has a wide portfolio of gas turbines capable of burning up to 75% of hydrogen, which are 
planned to run 100% on hydrogen by 2030. Just recently, one of Siemens Energy’s  gas turbine s 
operated 100 % with renewable hydrogen and completed a successful series of tests that prove 
the viability of state -of-the-art turbines for a renewable future.  
 
The 2023 fiscal year also showed the importance of reliable grids. The Grid Technologies business, 
which supplies products for power transmission, received several major contracts for HVDC links , 
including one that will ensure 6 gigawatts of offshore wind power will be transported from the 
German North Sea to the mainland .  
 
From an ESG perspective, Siemens Energy achieved its target set in 2019 of operating 100% of its 
own activities with green electricity by 2023. The company  is well ahead of plan for Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions and is also absolutely in line with expectations according to SBTI (Science Based 
Targets Initiative)  for the important Scope 3 emissions. Further details will be provided in the 
Sustainability Report on December 6. 
 
 
Guarantees to enable the energy transition  
 
Due to the enormous demand for Siemens Energy's energy transition technologies, the current 
order backlog of the entire Siemens Energy portfolio amounts to €112 billion. With the long 
project durations in the energy sector, guarantees for  advance d payment s, performance or 
warranty bonds  are a standard instrument of the industry . These guarantees are issued by banks 
for a fee  and the guarantee is usually between 5 % and 25 % of the order value. Although 
guarantees are an established industry -wide instrument, i n practice they are rarely called  upon . 
According to a study conducted by the ICC in April 2022, the industry average of guarantees 
default is 0.2%.   
 
After constructive and intensive talks, the German government has agreed that it will counter -
guarantee €7.5 billion of a total amount of €12 billion of guarantees, of which €11 billion are 
provided to Siemens Energy by a consortium of banks. In return, the federal government will

receive a standard market payment  from Siemens Energy . The remaining €1 billion will be 
provided by an additional consortium led by Deutsche Bank.  
 
In addition,  Siemens Energy AG and Siemens AG have agreed on a structure which covers the 
theoretical default risk  of the guarantees by providing access to a first loss amount of up to 
€1 billion  which is covered by a share collateral and payment deferrals .  
 
Siemens Energy's order growth in important projects for the energy transition, as mentioned 
above, can now be secured long -term while reducing risks for the parties involved. All agreements 
are subject to further formal approvals by the parties involved.  
 
 
Strong liquidity and a strengthened balance sheet  
 
In addition to securing the guarantee facilities to safeguard its own growth, Siemens Energy is 
strengthening its balance sheet. The company will sell 18% of its stake in Siemens Limited, India 
(SIL) to Siemens AG. SIL is a publicly listed company in India. When Siemens Energy AG was 
established in 2020, SIL was not yet unbundled for administrative reasons. Siemens Energy 
currently still holds 24 % of the company, while Siemens AG holds 51 %. This partial sale is a first 
step in the planned – and now accelerated – unbundling of Siemens Energy and Siemens AG in 
India. The proceeds from the sale amount to ca. €2.1  billion and are based on the share price of 
SIL (volume weighted average price (VWAP) on the last 5 trading days prior to the conclusion of 
the agreement). However, the partial sale has no impact on Siemens Energy’s operations in India. 
These will continu e to the same extent as before under a supplementary agreement. India 
remains a st rategically important growth market for Siemens Energy, in which the company 
continues to invest. Nothing will change for Siemens Energy's customers.  
 
“We have a strong balance sheet, and we are making it even stronger as we execute on our 
existing divestment  program and accelerate the company’s transformation ,” Chief Financial 
Officer Maria Ferraro said.

Outlook for fiscal year 202 4 
 
Siemens Energy  overall expects comparable revenue growth (excluding currency translation and 
portfolio effects) in fiscal year 202 4 in a range of 3% to 7% (actual figure FY 202 3: 7.3%) and a 
profit margin before special items of negative 2% to positive 1% (actual figure FY 202 3: negative 
8.9%). Furthermore, we expect a  Net income of up to €1bn (actual figure FY 2023: Net loss of 
€4,588m) including impacts from disposals and the acceleration of the portfolio transformation . 
Free cash flow before taxes is expected to be around a negative €1.0 billion amount (actual figure 
FY 2023: €784 million.)  
 
When it comes to revenue we are now much more positive on growth outlook for fiscal year 2026 
for Grid Technology (2025 target stood at mid -single growth; new target low double digit growth) 
and Transformation of Industries (2025 target stood at mid -single  growth; new target high -single 
digit growth) which is then also reflected in higher margin targets for those two business for fiscal 
year 2026 (compared to fiscal 2025). More details will be presented at the company´s Capital 
Market Day on November 21.  
 
For the business areas, find more details in the appendix.  
 
Siemens Energy will give a nother update on its business, including more detailed mid-term targets 
for the business and strategic decisions for Siemens Gamesa, at the company’s Capital Market Day

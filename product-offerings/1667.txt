Ammonia Syngas 
Trains with Steam 
Turbine DrivesSTEAM TURBINES
any ammonia plants in the United 
States and abroad are more than 50 
years old. As operators seek to extend 
the life of these facilities, syngas trains have become a 
target of modernization projects due to their significant 
impact on overall plant efficiency, production capacity, 
and operating expenses. 
In recent years, revamp requests for ammonia syngas 
trains have focused on upgrades to legacy steam turbine 
drives. Currently, more than 35 Delaval 103-JAT steam 
turbines are in operation in Kellogg process-based ammonia 
plants globally. There are many available upgrades for 
syngas trains that utilize the 103-JAT frame. Modernization 
options are diverse and can meet a wide range of plant 
requirements for uptime, efficiency, costs, and footprint. 
STEAM PATH REVAMP
Steam path revamps are an effective way to improve a 
steam turbine’s power, reliability, and efficiency. 
With modern thermodynamic and mechanical design 
software, in certain cases, it is possible to pass more flow 
through a turbine and increase its rated output by simply 
changing the design of the first-stage blades and nozzle 
plate. Advanced 3D modeling software enables OEMs to Mimplement new designs with greater predictability and 
fewer challenges, such as vibration. This capability is 
especially relevant today, with many customers opting for 
performance guarantees, particularly when it 
comes to uptime. 
In one case study, upgrading multiple steam pathways 
increased the turbine’s rated power from 13,095 HP to 
17,000 HP, in addition to a 6 - 7% efficiency improvement.
 New steam paths utilize optimized airfoil designs, 
improved seals, and a fine-tuned aerodynamic match of 
stationary to rotating airfoils. Additionally, improvements 
to the mechanical components such as bearings, seals, and 
valve operating gear parts can lead to improved reliability. 
One revamp to the Delaval 103-JAT is a conversion 
from a two- to three-wheel configuration. Original 
two-stage 103-JAT frames can generate around 11,000 HP. 
Converting to a three-stage design offers several advan-
tages, including an approximate 6% increase in steam rate, 
higher reliability, and improved rotor dynamics due to 
thicker shafts and larger journal bearings. Original 
internals can be kept and used as spares.
Several other minor upgrades can be made during the 
same scheduled maintenance period. Some examples 
include but are not limited to:
Turbomachinery International  •  September/October 2024  •  23efficient operation. In many cases, RDS can be 
implemented to enable advanced capabilities, 
such as early warning of failures, root cause 
analyses, remote troubleshooting, etc. 
TRIP AND THROTTLE VALVES 
One of the most challenging tasks for 
ammonia plants utilizing steam turbine drives 
for syngas compressors is to prevent a turbine 
overspeed triggered by designated turbine 
monitoring inputs. 
Trip and throttle valves (TTVs) are 
designed to protect personnel and plant assets 
by rapidly stopping steam flow into the 
turbine. Many syngas trains today still utilize 
mechanical latch TTV technology, which was 
developed in the 1950s. While proven, past 
experiences overhauling TTVs have shown 
that many pressure boundary components, 
like cast valve bodies and yokes, are used well 
beyond their normal service life due to years 
of exposure to unknown pressure and 
temperature transients. Issues such as 
erosion, corrosion, and stress cracks have 
been discovered while performing non-de-
structive testing. These components can 
usually be repaired or replaced; however, 
lengthy and costly weld repairs or complete 
casting replacements can exceed new 
technology valve replacement costs and 
extend loss of production.
Siemens Energy’s Gimpel TTVs have been 
used on a wide range of OEM steam turbine 
frames since the 1950s. The top inlet Gimpel 
valves (TITTVs) on the Delaval 103-JAT steam 
turbine frame have always been challenging to 
replace. The mechanical latch design is 
outdated, and standard valve replacement 
options do not fit the available deck space.
Corrosion and contaminate build-up on 
TTVs are also problematic, as they can affect 
trip-time or full close of the valve. In most 
valve designs, spring compression is used to 
reset the TTV during partial stroke testing 
(PST) through direct mechanical movement Spherical nuts for control valves. Nearly all 
Delaval turbines use an internal lifting bar to 
sequentially raise the steam control valves. 
Older units use flat-bottomed nuts assembled 
to individual valve stems to set the lifting 
adjustment and lift the valves. In cases where 
the valve seat and control valve are misaligned, 
a bending moment can be introduced into the 
valve stem during the initial lift—this could 
eventually lead to valve-stem failure. Installing 
nuts with a spherical bottom addresses this 
problem. The nut allows the valve to place itself 
in the valve seat and eliminates the inherent 
bending moment. This design has been 
successfully used for over 20 years.
Anti-lube valve rack bushing conversion. On 
older machines, the main lever arm on the 
control valve rack is fixed in end support 
columns by ball or roller bearings. These 
bearings are in a high-temperature area atop 
the steam chest and require routine lubrication 
with high-temperature grease. The location and 
temperature are a challenge to any form of 
maintenance and, as a result, the bearings 
eventually seize or wear prematurely.
Self-lubricating sleeves can be installed in 
place of the original bearings to eliminate 
routine lubrication requirements. These have 
been proven for years on later-designed 
turbines. The conversion package consists of 
sleeves and custom-designed adapter 
bushings as direct drop-in replacements—no 
field machining is required. The conversion 
package includes the parts, plus an updated 
valve gear assembly drawing showing these 
parts for future records.
Retrofitting control systems to enable 
remote monitoring and diagnostic services 
(RDS).  Many legacy steam turbines are still 
operated using mechanical-hydraulic or older 
electronic controls. Wear and tear on 
components and an uncertain supply of spare 
parts for older electronic systems can impair FIGURE 1: Performance Comparison Before and After Steam Path Revamp

STEAM TURBINES
via handwheel operation. The potential for 
spurious trips caused by the TTV during PST can lead some operators to avoid and/or delay recommended stroke testing (every 2 - 4 weeks), which presents a significant safety risk.
Improvements to the Gimpel TTV 
technology are continually made to address operational pain points and support the increasing demand for plant safety. Currently, Gimpel offers two types of modern valve replacements for TITTVs on Delaval 103-JAT frames, designed with unique steam section geometry to facilitate space constraints on existing deck arrangements.
Fully Oil-Operated TTVs (OOTTV). Designed 
for pull-to-close operation, OOTTVs utilize hydraulic oil pressure supplied by the turbine control oil system for valve reset and PST. With hydraulic operation, OOTTVs utilize a stronger closing spring for faster trip time (0.03 second versus 0.05 second for TITTV) and more accurate throttling at start-up. Both oil-operated trip valves (OOTVs) and OOTTVs are available depending on the turbine’s in-operation throttling requirements.
Electro-Hydraulic TTVs (EHTTV). Designed 
for pull-to-close or push-to-close operation, EHTTVs have a self-contained hydraulic system and a microprocessor-controlled electro-hydraulic actuator. EHTTVs close in 0.3 seconds or less and provide the most accurate turbine throttling on start-up. No turbine oil is required. The valves can be installed in any orientation based on the available space and are most adaptable for integration into a distributed control system. 
Replacement of a mechanical latch TTV 
with one of these two options can yield a high return on investment. In recent years, Siemens Energy has executed numerous TTV replacements on ammonia syngas trains and received positive feedback from customers. Real-world experience has shown that, in many cases, the costs of installing new technology versus repair costs of a decades-old safety device provide a lower total cost of ownership and improved operational and performance benefits.
FOOTPRINT SOLUTION 
In recent years, footprint solutions have emerged as an economical alternative to short-term repairs or partial modernizations. 
A footprint turbine is a replacement 
machine that can be installed with few—and in some cases, zero—modifications to the existing foundation or piping interfaces. The current oil system, the driven machine, and/or the gear can be reused or adapted according to new operating parameters. The approach is especially appropriate when modifications must be made for new operating data or when the service life of highly stressed components has been exhausted. 
One significant advantage of a footprint 
turbine is the increase in plant availability resulting from lower production downtime. The components in the new turbine are designed and manufactured according to unique customer requirements. As existing capital and spare parts can still be used, the investment expense is comparatively lower than purchasing a brand-new turbine system.FIGURE 2: Gimpel oil-operated trip and throttle valve with unique steam section casting.COMPRESSOR REVAMPS 
Compressor revamps are applicable when process conditions have changed sufficiently such that the original compressor aero design is no longer appropriate, i.e., the unit is operating at or near its boundary conditions. While there are cases where the installation of a new compressor package and foundation, piping, ancillary systems, etc., is unavoidable, operators can save on CAPEX and associated downtime by modifying or upgrading the existing compressor. Potential upgrades can include:
Complete re-aero of the compressor internals and conversion of the gearset, including stationary and rotating parts, without changes to the casing, external process connections, and/or existing footprint
Upgrades to the lube oil or control system to enable remote monitoring
Material upgrades to O-rings (upgrade to polymer or Teflon) or labyrinth seals (from aluminum to PEEK/PEK)
DETERMINING THE RIGHT 
MODERNIZATION APPROACH
For any ammonia plant modernization project, a 
comprehensive analysis of the steam turbine and compressor condition, along with customer objectives, is required to determine the optimal approach. A look at the current and future requirements will quickly reveal which systems, components, and parts can still be used and which have to be adapted and replaced.
After a preliminary evaluation, a feasibility 
analysis can be conducted, which allows the operator to evaluate the costs of retrofits or upgrades for the existing turbine(s) and system. Modernization activities can then be scheduled to coincide with planned outages so that customer downtime can be minimized and operators realize a maximum return on investment.  

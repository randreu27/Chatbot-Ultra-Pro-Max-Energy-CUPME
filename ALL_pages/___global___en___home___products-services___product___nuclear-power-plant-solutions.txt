Turbomachinery expertise based on more than 60 years of experience with nuclear power plants ~ 23% of all nuclear power plants worldwide run with Siemens Energy I&C Our nuclear turbosets at Olkiluoto power plant produce ~12% of electricity in Finland Contact us Our comprehensive portfolio includes rotating equipment (generators and steam turbines for nuclear power plants), components and systems for the "conventional island" as well as qualified operational DCS, Power-to-Grid, eBOP and back-up power solutions. With a focus on long-term service support and advanced technologies that are intended to meet the highest safety and quality standards, we are committed to providing reliable and sustainable solutions. With decades of experience in the nuclear industry, we have become established as a trusted partner for all of those involved in this sector. Overview of Siemens Energy expertise in nuclear energy Our tailored steam turbine portfolio is designed to meet the unique demands of the nuclear sector, earning us a reputation as a reliable partner. We focus on the conventional power island, and supporting reactor developers with our experience with power plant design , backed by the extensive nuclear heritage of Siemens KWU, Westinghouse, and Parsons. Our rich legacy of more than 50 years enables us to provide tailor-made solutions that cater to the distinctive needs of nuclear power plants. Our portfolio for nuclear power plants includes the components for the conventional island (water-steam-cycle) Tailored turbine island solutions for large-scale nuclear plants and small modular reactors Our turbine island solutions offer steam turbine generator trains ranging from 20 MW to 1900 MW for nuclear power plants. These trains offer solutions from half speed applications with high power outputs, to turbines for small modular reactors (SMRs) recognized for their efficiency, reliability and availability. SST-800 industrial steam turbine for Small Modular Reactors (SMR). SST-8000 full speed application steam turbine for Small Modular Reactors (SMR). SST-9000 half speed application steam turbine for high power output. Our SST-9000 advanced low-pressure turbine shrunk-on disk designs are tailored for high-power applications, serving as a key enabler for maximum availability. This technology is designed to help prevent stress-corrosion cracking, potentially eliminating the need to replace low-pressure rotors or disks throughout the design lifetime of half-speed turbines. Our comprehensive instrumentation and control systems are designed to monitor plant performance with precision and reliability. Our expertise in extended water-steam cycle solutions helps promote an efficient and reliable plant operation. With a global supply chain and customized solutions, we can adeptly address local requirements, drawing upon substantial experience and flexibility. Additionally, our service offerings encompass long term maintenance programs for new build projects as well as the life extension, recommissioning, and modernization of existing nuclear facilities, which help to provide their safety, reliability, and efficiency with a wide array of services. Our modernization solutions for the steam turbine and generator components include heat rate and power output improvements as well as extended component maintenance inspection intervals. Our components portfolio for nuclear power plants We offer the following components for nuclear power plants: Steam Turbine Set: Steam Turbine Generator Set, Auxiliary Systems Water-Steam-Cycle (Condensers, MSRs, Pre-Heaters/Vessels, Pumps, Pump Drives) Distributed Control System (DCS)/Instrumentation & Controls (I&C): Qualified operational DCS, Turbine controls, BoP and auxiliary control, Unit controls, Cyber security Electrical balance of plant (eBoP): Electrical protection systems, Excitation systems Back-Up Power/Alternative Use Cases: Aeroderivative Gas Turbines , Diesel, Batteries, Electrolyzers Power to Grid Transmission/Distribution: HV, MV, LV, Transformers and Switch gears Our services for nuclear steam turbines and generators Siemens Energy offers a comprehensive range of services for nuclear steam turbines and generators which promote optimal performance.

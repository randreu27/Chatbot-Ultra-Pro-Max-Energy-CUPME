Our compact high speed busbar transfer system (HSBT-Compact) based on the SIPROTEC 6MD85 bay controller allows interruption-free or a short currentless gap transfer between two or three incoming feeders of medium voltage switchgears. This ensures a continuous power supply and safe functioning of auxiliaries in a power plant or an industrial plant. Benefits of Siemens Energy HSBT solutions Flexible arrangement and marshalling of input and output signals Compact dimensions – can be directly installed in the switchgear Modular hardware and simple wiring design – no additional components necessary Semiconductor outputs for circuit breaker ON/ OFF commands Easy configuration and operation either via DIGSI 5 software or from the display Support of multiple communication protocols Get in touch We appreciate your interest in our products.

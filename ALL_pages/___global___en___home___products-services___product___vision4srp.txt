The solution features an easy-to-install technology with a user-friendly interface while focusing on the most essential monitoring aspects and utilizes innovative IoT technologies to change and improve the way SRP’s are being monitored in many parts of the industry. So how does it work? State-of-the-art IoT-technology is at the heart of the Vision4SRP The benefits of Vision4SRP are made possible by leveraging continuing improvements in computing power, edge-cloud concepts and communications technology combined with advanced computer vision algorithms. Smartly combining the various elements results in feasible, affordable solution addressing the industry’s needs for higher productivity and improved HSE performance Information on our key monitoring benefits White paper Typical questions received when it comes to indications of a pump’s performance: How can I increase my lease pumper’s productivity while reducing pump downtime? The lease pumper gets an overview of his pump fleet every morning from Vision4SRP highlighting pumps with issues before jumping in the car Thus he can focus his time on the pumps needing attention, spending less time driving and covering a larger fleet of pumps How can I spot developing issues early to avoid costly HSE issues and reputational damage Vision4SRP monitors a pump’s performance during the day and alerts the lease pumper of abnormal behavior like stuffing box failure Thus he can focus his time on the pumps needing attention, spending less time driving and covering a larger fleet of pumps What is required from me to implement the Vision4SRP? Vision4SRP, a solar-powered, self-sustaining camera can be easily mounted at any well site without any cabling The cloud environment can be set up very quickly, showing only the pumps that are under the lease pumper’s responsibility Information is delivered to the lease pumper via his smartphone Stay in Touch Energy Transition Five strategies Expand renewables​ Transform conventional power Strengthen electrical grids Drive industry decarbonization Secure supply chains Products and Services Products Services Solutions by industry Solutions by usecase Trainings Company​ About us Executive Board Supervisory Board Working with us Sustainability Innovation Compliance Publications Career Supplier Contact Reporting channels Subscribe to our newsletter Siemens Energy stories Siemens Gamesa Harness the power of wind with our wind power business Siemens Gamesa.

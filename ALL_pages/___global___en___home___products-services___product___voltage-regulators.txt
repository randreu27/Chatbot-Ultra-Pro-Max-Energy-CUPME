This translates into improved revenue for the utility company while also improving the quality of service to the customer. Interview with Tilo Else, Siemens Energy's Vice President for distribution transformers The energy market is rapidly evolving with the energy transition as one of the most fundamental changes: What challenges does this rapidly changing energy landscape pose for customers? Read the complete interview Voltage regulator: the alternative to grid-expansion Our voltage regulators are a cost-saving alternative to grid-expansion, as they can be easily installed and integrated into existing grid structures. We offer flexible regulation models for optimum operation. Technology The standard voltage regulator provides approximately 10% adjustment. However, in some designs, regulations of 15% and 20% are also available. Available at 50 or 60 Hz, their ratings are calculated according to the voltage level of the transformer they are connected to (i.e., 10%). Voltage level ratings for 1-phase voltage regulators vary between 2.5kV and 19.9 kV and between  76.2kVA and 1110kVA. 3-phase units are available at 13.2kV, 34.5kV, or from 500kVA up to 4,000kVA. Benefits Cost-saving alternative to grid expansion Easily integrated into existing grid structure Easy installation Extensive regulating range Flexible regulation models for optimum operation Voltage regulators for all needs Siemens Energy invented the voltage regulator in 1932. Voltage regulators are highly reliable soutions for stabilizing voltage fluctions in the customer's grid 24/7. They are notably more cost-effective for customers compared to other oprions. Voltage regulators come in 1-phase or 3-phase models. Different cooling systems are available. They can be applied to any electrical system to improve voltage quality. The standard voltage regulator provides approximately 10% adjustment. However, in some designs, regulations of 15% and 20% are also available. Available at 50 or 60 Hz, their ratings are calculated according to the voltage level of the transformer they are connected to (i.e., 10%). Voltage level ratings for 1-phase voltage regulators vary between 2.5 kV and 19.9 kV and between 31.8 kVA and 889 kVA. 3-phase units are available at 13.2 kV, 34.5 kV, or from 500 kVA up to 4,000 kVA. JFR and SFR medium-voltage voltage regulators JFR medium-voltage voltage regulator JFR padmount voltage regulator SFR medium-voltage voltage regulators When it comes to voltage regulation, Siemens Energy provides technology that serves the customer. Our manufacturing experience for voltage regulators and controls is unsurpassed in the industry. Today, Siemens Energy has the largest quantity of regulators installed worldwide. The type JFR has been an industry leader since 1936. It is a single-phase 5/8% step regulator utilizing the Siemens Energy type MJ4 or MJ6 control panel or adaptable to any control panel. Features and benefits Electrostatically-applied polyester paint provides greater resistance to corrosion in harsh environments. Type-316 stainless steel external hardware to eliminate rust and galling. Sealed tank has pressure relief device to vent gases produced during tap changes. The Siemens 55°C rise regulators can be loaded to up to 12 percent above nameplate rating, with the 65°C insulation system. External metal-oxide varistor (MOV) bypass arrester provides superior protection to the regulator series winding from surge and system transients. Oil-sight gauge allows oil levels and oil conditions to be checked without de-energizing the regulator. Motor capacitor installed in the control cabinet allows replacement without bypassing and transitioning the regulator out of service. Polarized disconnect switch (PDS) facilitates easy control installation of change out without taking the regulator out of service. Cover-mounted terminal block provides easier access to wiring by eliminating the need to go under the oil to change tap connections. Monitor and automatically control output voltage through the use of state-of-the-art microprocessor control panels MJ-6. High-creep bushings provide a minimum creep distance of 17" (432 mm). Oil-drain valve includes an oil sampling valve for easy access. Platform base is equipped with provisions to securely attach regulator to sub-base assembly.

Additionally, the tamper-resistant, secured cabinet design protects the access to components including the drain valve, bushings and cover bolts. The layout and positioning of the controls is on the narrow end of the box, which allows for additional placement options and smaller operational space requirements. The controls are ergonomically positioned for easy access for operators. The bushing connections and sample valve reside in the lower enclosure. With the Siemens Energy padmount voltage regulator, safety and reliability are enhanced, construction costs are reduced, and land requirements are smaller for a more attractive physical profile for the public. The type SFR is a vertically integrated, three-phase regulator, which also comes with the capability of separating the tap changer. This significantly increases the life of the regulator. Siemens Energy offers distinct advantages with all of our three-phase regulators engineered and manufactured in-house. Our expertise in both technology and service gives us additional advantages in the custom engineering necessary for most three-phase regulator applications. The SFR voltage regulator has proven its reliability and durability in the toughest environments. Unit construction, tough exterior coating and a side inspection door are just a few of the time-tested features of today’s SFR. Additionally, Siemens Energy offers the popular SFR-X which features a separate tap-changing mechanism compartment allowing for easy inspection and maintenance. Separating the regulator tap-changer significantly increases the life of the regulator by eliminating arcing in the main tank containing the coil and core. Features and benefits Features include: Magnetic-temperature indicator Pressure-relief device Lightning-arrester brackets Magnetic-type, liquid-level indicator Magnetic-type temperature indicator Special bushings MR tap-changer option (SFR-MR) Customized controls Special CT/PT Station class arresters Separate tap changer compartment (available with  SFR-X and SFR-MR). Options Liquid-temperature indicator with or without alarm Pressure-relief gauge with or without alarm.

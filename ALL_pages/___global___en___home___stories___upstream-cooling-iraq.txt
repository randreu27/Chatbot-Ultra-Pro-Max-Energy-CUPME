Revolutionizing Upstream Cooling in Iraq Challenges: Meet peak power demand to beat high temperatures during summer Iraq faces an incredible need for power, especially during the scorching summer months when temperatures can soar above 50°C. The country's electricity demand peaks during these times, driven by the need for air conditioning, cooling systems, and other essential services. To help address this challenge, Siemens Energy designed a solution that can maximize the gas turbine’s power output with just the push of a button. Solution: Innovative Upstream Cooling for installed gas turbines The innovative Upstream Cooling (USC) system is a retrofittable evaporation cooling solution designed to enhance power output in hot and dry environments. The system works by spraying water in front of the filter house against the flow direction, simulating a cool, rainy day through a precisely engineered water misting system. This process cools down the incoming air, saturates it, and increases the mass flow, thereby boosting the power output of the gas turbines. One of the standout features of the upstream cooling system is its simplicity. The system can be activated with just the push of a button, making it easy for operators to manage and optimize power output as needed. This user-friendly design ensures that the system can be quickly and efficiently deployed to meet immediate power demands. The first installation as a pilot was completed in 2019 and showed a promising result. Since then, the solution has been installed on 40 gas turbine units across 9 power plants in Iraq, adding up to 700MW of additional power. Benefits: Boosting Iraq’s power generation capacity and supplying reliable energy USC directly translates to increased power generation, 35MW of additional power per gas turbine, depending on the model type. Unlike traditional cooling systems that require lengthy shutdowns for installation and commissioning, USC installation has a minimal impact on GT operation. In fact, shutdowns are only necessary for commissioning, which takes 4 days for Siemens Energy gas turbines and ZERO days for other manufacturers’ units. The innovative misting system, which uses tap water, guarantees safe operation by preventing wet filters, a common issue with traditional cooling methods. This ensures reliable and uninterrupted performance, minimizing downtime and maximizing plant efficiency. Siemens Energy's Upstream Cooling system has proven to be beneficial for Iraq's power infrastructure. By boosting power output during critical periods, the system helps ensure a more reliable and stable energy supply for the country. While the Upstream Cooling system is particularly effective in hot and dry environments like Iraq, Siemens Energy offers a range of solutions tailored to different climate conditions.

Our Portfolio We’re prepared for a complex and interconnected energy landscape Today’s energy grids aren’t yet ready for tomorrow’s energy landscape. That’s why we’re increasing grid connectivity, grid resilience, grid digitalization and grid decarbonization of power grids all over the world.​​ ​We enable transmission grids to cope with growing demands, the shift from traditional fossil-fuel based energy systems to renewable sources, and increasing system complexity with our solutions, products, digital offerings, and services. Step by step, we’re making power grids ready.​ We shape our energy landscape through: We build upon our long-standing experience and numerous successful projects: HVDC projects realized worldwide 58 flexible AC transmission systems projects globally commissioned 900 + households powered with electricity from a single HVDC transformer 50 MIL delivered units of our Blue clean air and vacuum switching technology 2,650 + Highlighted sectors and industries: TSOs, DSOs and utilities In view of major global, but regionally distinct developments like demand growth, decentralization, decarbonization and digitalization, a reliable access to energy has to be secured. We share this priority with all power utilities and specifically also with transmission and distribution system operators. As one of the leading partners in this area, our global, highly skilled teams work hard to reach these common goals. Renewable No matter if power is produced by solar, wind or water – we provide products, systems and services to establish grid connections, take care of operation and maintenance, monitoring and controlling of renewable energy systems. Oil & gas Respecting the high safety and reliability standards, we help our oil and gas customers to ensure an efficient energy supply for upstream, midstream and downstream applications – no matter if on- or offshore. To establish and optimize the energy-intensive processes in the basic chemical, petrochemical as well as fine and specialty chemical industries, we take all critical and sector-specific needs into account. Industrial production For industries like metals, mining, semiconductors, pulp & paper, hydrogen and food & beverages, a stable and reliable energy supply is crucial for boosting efficiency and productivity to be competitive. At Siemens Energy, we understand the unique demands of these industries and offer tailored solutions to meet them. Our comprehensive range includes containerized substations, co-developed products and systems, robust power substations, advanced grid stability solutions, and services. We also offer grid studies for optimized grid connection or complete off-grid solutions. Our market-leading and sustainable technologies are designed to keep industrial operations running smoothly and efficiently. Data centers Data centers are experiencing rapid growth in energy demand, creating the need for a reliable and stable Grid across all voltages whilst supporting the respective environmental and sustainability goals.

With the advancement of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and the innovative use of CO₂ stored in sedimentary rocks, we are on the brink of a geothermal revolution. We at NGP, a venture at Siemens Energy , believe we can turn a climate challenge into an opportunity by using captured CO₂ to generate clean energy, thereby reducing atmospheric CO₂ levels. Join us on this exciting journey! Are you interested in making an investment, and learn more? Contact venture team Revolutionizing the energy sector with NextGen Geothermal Power technology NextGen Geothermal Power (NGP) is not just a complementary business model to CCS. It’s a game-changer. By transforming CO₂ storage facilities into revenue-generating power plants, we provide green electricity and heat around the clock. Our cutting-edge technology uses CO₂ as a geothermal working fluid, unlocking untapped energy sources and maximizing both efficiency and sustainability. Picture this: CO₂ storage sites turned into profitable powerhouses , delivering continuous, weather-independent energy. This is the promise of nextgen geothermal power. Our vision: Making renewable energy available anytime, anywhere, and at competitive costs by harnessing the unique properties of CO₂ and advanced geothermal techniques. Our mission: Convert CO₂ storage facilities into efficient, revenue-generating power plants that provide continuous green electricity and heat. After our successful proof of concept in 2022/2023, we are now focused on developing our first small commercial power plant. This plant will target a net power output of less than 10 MW and is scheduled to start operations in 2027. Alongside this, we are continuously advancing our technology to enhance efficiency and scalability. Learn how NextGen Geothermal Power works Next-gen geothermal power serves as an add-on to carbon storage and utilizes the CO₂ stored in the earth . It starts with the injection of CO₂ into deep underground rock formations. While the CO₂ flows through these formations, it absorbs heat from the surrounding rock. Due to the strong thermosiphon effect, the heated CO₂ naturally rises to the surface without additional energy input required. Once at the surface, the hot CO₂ drives a turbine to generate electricity. Additionally, the CO₂ can be utilized to provide direct heat for industrial processes or district heating systems. After energy extraction, the CO₂ cools down and is re-injected into the reservoir, creating a closed-loop system that delivers emissions free baseload capable and fully dispatchable energy.

Felix Böhmer CEO felix.boehmer@siemens-energy.com Michael Wechsung CTO michael.wechsung@siemens-energy.com Jörg Strohschein CFO joerg.strohschein@siemens-energy.com FAQs What is the advantage of using CO₂ compared to water? Using CO₂ as a working fluid in geothermal power systems offers several significant advantages over traditional water-based systems. Firstly, CO₂ has a lower viscosity compared to water, which reduces the risk of inducing seismic activities while cycling the fluid, making the system safer and more stable. Additionally, the density of CO₂ is highly sensitive to temperature changes, leading to a strong natural thermosiphon effect. This natural circulation eliminates the need for subsurface pumps, reducing energy consumption and operational complexity. Moreover, due to the sensitivity of CO₂ to temperature changes, NextGen Geothermal Power does not require geothermal anomalies (areas with unusually high geothermal gradients) to operate efficiently. This expands the potential locations where the technology can be deployed. Furthermore, NextGen Geothermal Power is designed as a direct cycle system, which reduces the number of components required. This simplification leads to lower capital expenditures (CAPEX) and potentially lower maintenance costs. By leveraging these advantages, the NextGen Geothermal Power system can achieve higher efficiency, lower operational costs, and greater flexibility in site selection compared to traditional water-based geothermal systems. How much CO₂ is required? The amount of CO₂ required for the NextGen Geothermal Power system depends on geological boundary conditions. As a rule of thumb, you can estimate that 1-2 MW of electrical power can be generated per million tons of CO₂ stored in the reservoir. Is it possible to store additional CO₂ while operating NextGen Geothermal Power? Yes, it is possible to store additional CO₂ while operating the NextGen Geothermal Power system. Our technology is designed to be flexible and can accommodate the injection of additional CO₂ into the reservoir during operation. This not only enhances the geothermal energy production but also provides an effective means of sequestering more CO₂, contributing to climate change mitigation. Are there any CO₂ leakages in the cycle? No, the tightness of the storage location is assured by the CCS project. The CO₂ is tightly trapped due to a sealing caprock. The proof that these caprocks are effective is evidenced by the presence of natural CO₂ and hydrocarbon reservoirs, which have been able to store fluids for millions of years. This natural geological sealing ensures that the CO₂ remains securely contained within the subsurface, preventing any leakages. Are there any leakages on top surface? No, the NextGen Geothermal Power system utilizes state-of-the-art top surface equipment designed to prevent any CO₂ leakages. This includes advanced sealing technologies for all rotating equipment and other critical components. Proven systems already exist that manage CO₂ without any leakage, including during CO₂ compression. By employing these high-quality technologies and materials, we ensure that CO₂ remains securely contained throughout the entire process. Our rigorous safety standards and commitment to environmental protection ensure that there are no CO₂ leakages on the top surface. Why has no one done this before? The NextGen Geothermal Power system utilizes CO₂ from carbon storage systems for power production. This approach is emerging as a viable solution because the carbon capture and storage (CCS) market is just beginning to take off. The technology and infrastructure for CCS are rapidly evolving. As CCS becomes more widespread, the opportunity to use captured CO₂ in geothermal energy production is becoming feasible and attractive.

Reliability > 99% On-site or off-site maintenance 24-hour swap capability 17 maintenance days in 15 years 30,000 equivalent operating hours (EOHs) between hot section inspections Part load operation increases the time between overhauls High lifetime profitability Thanks to a long lifetime with maximized uptime, low lifecycle cost and easy servicability, the SGT-700 offers you a high lifetime profitability. The robust industrial design offers a low degradation over time. Core engine Package solutions Power plants Service Fuels Emissions Ingenious design to the core The SGT-700 provides the best availability of its class, thanks to a robust and well-proven design. The compact twin-shaft engine is easy to maintain and allows for flexible operation with excellent efficiency at part load conditions. Using the same design for power generation and mechanical drive increases the operational reliability. Reliable and easy to maintain The SGT-700 employs an 11-stage axial-flow transonic compressor incorporating the latest aerodynamics, with variable guide vanes for robust operability and optimized performance over a wide range of operating conditions. Two-stage free power turbine The 2-stage uncooled free power turbine offers a nominal shaft speed of up to 6,500 rpm. For mechanical drive, it may operate at 50 to 105 % of the nominal speed. The  power turbine can be matched for optimal performance at different ambient conditions. Packages for power generation and mechanical drive The SGT-700 package offers you a small footprint and excellent serviceability. It features a modular and flexible design with single-lift capability. The driver for both the power generation and the mechanical drive package is the same. A gas turbine package includes: Gas turbine, enclosure, base frame, air intake, exhaust, lubricating systems, starter system, vibration monitoring system, firefighting system, package ventilation system, instrumentation, gas detection, fuel systems, gearbox (if needed). Power generation package The SGT-700 is ideal for simple cycle, combined cycle, cogeneration, and other heating applications thanks to its high exhaust temperature and the ability to handle sudden load changes. Low space requirements Modular design for high versatility Optimized for easy transportation Mechanical drive package Extreme desert and arctic climates, or harsh industrial environments are not expected to impair the SGT-700 mechanical drive package’s long service life. Variable power turbine speed: 50 to 105% High load on low-power turbine speed Extended lifetime on part-load operation Low part-load emissions SGT-700-based power plants For combined cycle and cogeneration (combined heat and power – CHP), Siemens offers a broad range of power plant configurations and scopes based on the SGT-700 gas turbine. For combined cycle, 1x1 or 2x1 configurations are part of the standardized portfolio. Excellent CC and CHP efficiency High combined cycle performance: In a 2x1 combined cycle configuration, the power output is 91.6 MW(e) at a net plant efficiency of 53.1%. Easy on-/off-site maintenance The SGT-700 is designed for maximized serviceability. On-site maintenance or a gas generator removal for off-site maintenance Gas generator swap within 24 hours Remote diagnostic service Our remote diagnostic service helps you to detect faults at an early stage and prevents outages. The service includes online monitoring, expert performance data analysis, and fleet data comparisons. Designed for easy serviceability Burners are accessible from the outside for easy replacement. The compressor casing is horizontally split, and the turbine casing is vertically split between gas generator and power turbine. Multipe boroscope holes allow for internal visual inspection of the compressor. Excellent fuel flexibility The SGT-700 offers best-in-class fuel flexibility that allows for high content of inert gases, hydrogen and heavy hydrocarbons: Ethane 100% Propane 100% Butanes and heavy alkanes 15% Hydrogen up to 55% Nitrogen 40% H₂S 3% The SGT-700 requires low gas supply pressure at site: 28 bar(a) / 406 psi(a). Fuel changeover (gas to liquid fuel and liquid fuel to gas) on load. Low emission capability The combustor and burner design give world-class emission performance over a wide load range and are capable of low NOₓ emission levels. Low emission levels are also received on liquid fuel without need of water injection.

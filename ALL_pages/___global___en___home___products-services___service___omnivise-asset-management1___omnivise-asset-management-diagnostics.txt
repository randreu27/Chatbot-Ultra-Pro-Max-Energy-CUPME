Asset centric Integrated asset view aggregates all information from every relevant monitoring function: process data from DCS, manual readings and vibration data, with advanced pattern recognition, image recognition and other forms of machine learning. It delivers a single, integrated and synchronized view of the assets and avoids multiple tool-specific views. 2. User and workflow centric Gives diagnosticians end-to-end digital workflow support, from collection to action, including efficient collaboration across roles with guided handover-workflows, such as from Diagnostics to Maintenance. Provides experts with guided case resolution, delivering all information needed to conclude cases fast and effectively, including Assigned Failure Modes and Effects (FMEA), criticality, asset history, and other factors. 3. Siemens Energy knowledge integration Provides codified knowledge via comprehensive asset templates (incl. FMEA and indicators). Use of the support button gives fast, direct access to the Siemens Energy expert network for know-how, experience and consulting help.

high demand by the industry, to generate process heat, helping to reduce production costs by up to 20%. Contact us “ The participation of Siemens Energy was vital to ensuring our success as they brought critical competences in the areas of engineering and construction to the project. Michael Wittmann DLR* Institute of Solar Research,  Project Director Molten Salt as a Heat Transfer Medium - Parabolic trough Solar Power Plant The customer challenge: Highly reliable electrical and DCS systems The DLR Institute of Solar Research, together with the University of Évora and industry partners from Germany and Spain, have built a solar parabolic trough test facility using molten salt as its heat transfer medium. It is part of the High Performance Solar 2 (HPS2) research project located in Évora, Portugal, which is a Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plant that uses the sun’s energy to generate electricity and heat. With a total thermal output of up to 3.5 megawatts, it is equipped with a steam generator that provides steam at a pressure of up to 140 bar and generates a thermal output of 1.6 megawatts. The plant aims to develop and optimize the use of molten salt as a primary fluid, operating between 500°C and 600°C, increasing efficiency and lowering CAPEX and OPEX costs. The solution: Effective support for the operators with Omnivise T3000 Siemens Energy was responsible for the engineering and construction of all electrical infrastructures (E-BOP), suppling the several systems installed by the consortium partners, plus the entire plant DCS, using our proven Omnivise T3000 control system , interconnected to two main black box systems (Solar Field Control and Trace Heating). The system supplied makes use of redundant configuration, by using PLC S7-400H and FH CPU410-5H, with 1000 hardwire I/Os, although the plant only uses around 500. The system is ready for future plant upgrades and additional research projects that will take place soon. Contact us Simulation: The digital twin of T3000 maps the real behavior of the system 1:1 without making any changes to the “real” system. Employees can be trained directly in Omnivise T3000 and new control concepts can be safely tested. Virtualization: By decoupling hardware and software, the control system is able to be run in a virtual environment. This allows the application software to be executed virtually without the need for dedicated hardware.

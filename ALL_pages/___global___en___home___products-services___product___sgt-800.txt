Designed to reduce environmental impact, the SGT-800 gas turbine will help you meet even the strictest emission regulations worldwide. Proven reliability Reliability has been a top priority from day one of the development of the SGT-800. Thanks to simple and robust technical solutions the reported average fleet reliability of the core engine and auxiliary systems lies at a world-class 99.1% for year 2024. Flexible solutions The SGT-800 offers broad flexibility in fuels, operating conditions, maintenance concepts, package solutions and ratings. These flexible solutions have been developed in order to satisfy your individual market-specific requirements. Maximized availability The SGT-800 features a compact, modular, maintenance-friendly design. This maintainability combined with the turbine’s robust single-shaft arrangement, long time between overhauls and long lifetime ensures its high operational availability. Flexible service concepts for on-site or off-site maintenance with possibility for 48-hour core engine exchange will maximize the availability even further. Excellent performance With its high electrical efficiency the SGT-800 is the core of your power plant installation – from simple cycle to combined cycle operation, with single or multiple units. Its excellent steam generation capability also makes the SGT-800 an ideal choice in combined heat and power (CHP) installations. Green biofuels: A proven fuel for gas turbines As we move away from fossil fuels, green fuel alternatives are needed to balance the volatile nature of solar and wind. A key option is to replace conventional natural gas and diesel fuels with green biofuels in gas turbines. Read the article Core engine Package solutions Power plants Service Fuels Emissions Ingenious design to the core The SGT-800 industrial gas turbine blends a robust, simple design for reliability and easy maintenance with high efficiency and low emissions. Its continuous evolution, based on fleet experience and proven design solutions, guarantees optimal performance and a long operational lifetime for your gas turbine. The gas turbine features a robust dual-fuel DLE system for clean combustion, without the complexity of burner of burner staging. The single-shaft engine is composed of a 2-bearing rotor with a 15-stage compressor and a 3-stage turbine. Classic or single-lift? Two different package solutions are available for increased flexibility in order to meet your individual requirements. Both are available for 50 Hz and 60 Hz markets. Standard options for hot and cold climates are available for operation at extreme ambient temperatures. SGT-800 classic package The classic package comprises preassembled modules with the gas turbine and gearbox on a single base frame. Mechanical auxiliary systems are mounted on a separate skid within the enclosure. A modular package allows for easy transportation and straightforward on-site installation. On-site maintenance, inspections, and overhauls are conveniently performed within the enclosure, providing added ease and efficiency. (Image: Configuration depending on rating) SGT-800 single-lift package The single-lift package is a preassembled unit available in two configurations: as a single-lift driver unit(i.e. gas turbine, gearbox and mechanical auxiliary systems on a single base frame) with the generator on the foundation, or as a complete skid-mounted train for 3-point mount installations, e.g. for power barges (SGT-800 SeaFloat). It offers a small footprint and the potential for a 48-hour core engine exchange. The single-lift operation of the driver unit or complete train results in a short installation and commissioning time on site. A special US-adapted option is available for specific requirements. (Image: Configuration depending on rating) SGT-800-based power plants Flexibility and efficiency are key for your power plant solutions. The excellent efficiency and steam-raising capability of the SGT-800 gas turbine make it outstanding in cogeneration – also called combined heat and power (CHP) –  and combined cycle installations. We offer you a broad range of power plant configurations based on one or multiple SGT-800 gas turbines. Within our standard plant configuration we can offer a high degree of scope flexibility. This enables plant optimization to suit your specific requirements, such as island-mode operation or multiple power blocks. A scope to fit your needs Whatever your application requirements, our flexible scope will fit your needs. We can offer a range of plant equipment – from gas turbine and steam turbine only, to full turnkey plant: Package Power island Power block Turnkey power plant Designed for flexible operation Our SGT-800-based power plants offer the flexibility required in today's volatile energy landscape: quick starts, fast load following and low emissions on low plant part-load operation. Designed for frequent starts and stops, they are the perfect match to back up renewable power sources in the grid. Excellent combined cycle and combined heat and power efficiency One or multiple SGT-800 gas turbines provide the core of a powerful combined cycle plant: In a 2x1 combined cycle configuration, the power output is up to 180 MW(e) at a net plant efficiency of more than 60%. In a combined heat and power (CHP) cycle, the efficiency is more than 92% with supplementary firing. Flexible maintenance – high availability Our comprehensive service portfolio ensures low life cycle costs and optimal performance throughout the turbine’s life cycle, including: Long Term Programs (LTP) Overhaul service Field service Spare parts Service exchange Remote diagnostic service Modernization and upgrades The SGT-800 offers high operational availability with up to 60,000 equivalent operating hours (EOHs) between major overhauls. We provide flexible standardized maintenance concepts, whether time-based or cycle-based. On-site maintenance or modular overhaul is available for package solutions, while the single-lift package offers off-site maintenance with 48-hour core engine exchange as an option. Designed for easy maintenance, the SGT-800's compact and modular setup allows for convenient access. The vertically split compressor casing enables easy on-site component exchange, and the burners can be quickly removed for maintenance inspections. Fuel flexibility matters Whatever you need: The SGT-800 offers gas only, liquid only (Diesel No.2) or dual fuel (gas/liquid) with on-load fuel-changeover capability. The excellent fuel flexibility allows e.g. for high content of inert gases, hydrogen and heavy hydrocarbons in the gas fuel composition without any maintenance impact. The engine, equipped with DLE burners, is capable to burn up to 75 vol% of hydrogen (H 2 ). The low gas supply pressure requirement (27–31 bar[a] / 390–450 psi[a]) reduces the need for a gas compressor on site. Best-in-class NOₓ and CO emission levels All SGT-800 units are equipped with a robust dual-fuel Dry Low Emission (DLE) combustion system to minimize NOₓ and CO emissions. The combustor and burner designs offer world-class emission performance over a wide load range with single-digit CO emission levels and capable of down to 9 ppm NO x emissions. With this gas turbine you will comply with both global and regional regulations. H2-Readiness - TÜV SÜD certificate TÜV SÜD has developed a guideline for defining the “H2-Readiness” of power plants and is offering an independent certification to original equipment manufacturers and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies. The certification increases investment security for utilities. Siemens Energy is the first company worldwide to receive this certification for its “H2-Ready” power plant concept for the SGT-800. The guideline for obtaining certification was developed in collaboration with subject matter experts from Siemens Energy.

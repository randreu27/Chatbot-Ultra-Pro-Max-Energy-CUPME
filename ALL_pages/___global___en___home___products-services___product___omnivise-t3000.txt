Control technology that is your bridge to the future must offer all of this – and much more. Cybersecurity Built-in security for your plant As part of the critical infrastructure, plants in the energy market have to fulfil more stringent requirements than ever before. With the risk of cyber attacks, this means looking beyond operational concerns and protecting plants against hacker attacks – and documenting compliance according to all legal requirements. Thanks to built-in security and our comprehensive cybersecurity portfolio, Omnivise T3000 is ideally suited to help operators protect their plant. The defense-in-depth concept strengthens your system to withstand external attacks. Omnivise T3000 is officially certified by TÜV SÜD according to IEC 62443, the leading standard for IT security for industrial communication networks. This is just one example of the numerous internationally recognized standards for which the Omnivise T3000 system as well as our development process is certified for. We provide long-term support so you can rely on a system that is always up-to-date. We support current hardware on a long-term basis and provide tried and tested security patches for the software at any time during operation. For you, this means long-term security – with no downtime. In addition, our Cybersecurity Operations Center (cSOC) helps you defend against or resolve cyberattacks 24/7.

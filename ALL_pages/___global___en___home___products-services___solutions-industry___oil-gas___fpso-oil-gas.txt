At the same time, offshore operators must be cognizant of reducing emissions and minimizing the weight and footprint of topsides modules, the latter of which can substantially impact facility development costs. FPSO Vessel Projects In recent years, advances in the design and engineering of critical equipment, such as gas turbines, electric motors, and compressors have helped the industry meet these demands. When coupled with digital solutions like Topsides 4.0 designed to leverage the power of data amassed from compression and other critical topsides assets, operators have been able to unlock hidden value and optimize production in a way that has previously not been possible. In addition to reducing capital expenditures, digital solutions enable remote operation with integrated automation and safety systems and can lower operating costs with reduced staffing, predictive analytics, and integrated asset level optimization.

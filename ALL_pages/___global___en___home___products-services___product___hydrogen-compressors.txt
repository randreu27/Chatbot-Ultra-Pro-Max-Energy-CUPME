Reciprocating compressors Primarily applied to lower volume flow, higher ratio applications High efficient H2 compression via positive displacement design Multiple capacity control options to achieve high efficiency part load flow rates Two well-referenced product lines – Process Reciprocating Compressors and High Speed Reciprocating Compressors to optimize hydrogen compressor solution Turbo compressors Solution of choice for moderate / high volume flows Single shaft or integrally geared compressors both available as optimized compression solutions The next generation of large scale H2 compression  - maximized pressure ratio per stage resulting in reduced frame size and stage count Download brochure The compressor technology doesn’t “care” about the “colour” of the hydrogen and how it is produced, it simply compresses according to the physics of a low mol-weight gas application. Both reciprocating and turbo compressors cover the complete map of low mol-weight applications. With each product having its strengths in overlapping areas, the choice of the product requires both technical as well as economic considerations. For this reason, finding a solution for hydrogen compression is always project-specific and can even combine both products to find the optimal and most efficient solution for the client’s compression needs. In general, our reciprocating compressors apply to applications which have small suction volume flows, high pressure ratios and/or high process flexibility requirements whilst our centrifugal compressors apply to low compression ratio and medium to high volume flow applications. Hydrogen compression – an integral part of the H₂ value chain Compression is the enabling technology for safe and cost-effective transport, storage and use of hydrogen throughout the value chain.

To help ensure you develop accurate and optimized solutions, there are key considerations which need to be clearly defined when developing your hydrogen compression solution: What is the gas composition and is there water in the gas? Is the flow provided the dry flow or the wet flow ? At what pressure is the gas being provided to the compressor? At what temperature is the gas being provided to the compressor? What cooling mediums are available on site for process gas cooling requirements between compression stages? If there is no water on site, what is the site ambient temperature for finfan air coolers? What discharge pressure is required? What level of lubrication oil carryover is acceptable downstream of compressor? What is the operating philosophy and capacity control requirement? To understand why these are important, watch our green hydrogen compressor story here.

This process is essential for various applications, such as storing hydrogen in high-pressure tanks, transporting it through pipelines, and utilizing it in fuel cells and other energy systems. What are the challenges of compressing hydrogen? Compressing hydrogen poses several challenges due to its unique properties. One of the primary issues is hydrogen embrittlement, a phenomenon where hydrogen atoms diffuse into metals, leading to reduced ductility and potential cracking. This necessitates the use of materials released for hydrogen exposure under specific boundary conditions and designs to ensure the durability and safety of compressors.Hydrogen molecules are very light and require substantial energy to be compressed to high pressures. This impacts the overall efficiency of hydrogen storage and transportation systems. What is the best compressor for hydrogen? The best compressor for hydrogen depends on the specific application and the operating conditions. Generally, reciprocating compressors, diaphragm compressors, and centrifugal compressors are highly regarded in the industry for hydrogen compression.The optimal choice will depend on factors such as the required pressure, flow rate, purity level, and specific use case. Consulting with our hydrogen compression experts will provide tailored solutions to meet your needs effectively. How big is the hydrogen compressor market? The hydrogen compressor market is experiencing significant growth driven by the increasing demand for hydrogen as a clean energy source. As of recent reports, the market size was estimated to be valued at several billion dollars.

Annual Shareholders' Meeting 2025: Joe Kaeser reelected as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Siemens Energy - February 20, 2025 To the speeches of Joe Kaeser, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, and Christian Bruch, President and CEO At today's virtual Annual General Meeting of Siemens Energy AG, the shareholders approved all items on the agenda by a large majority. At its peak, more than 1,074 people followed the webcast of the Annual General Meeting, with 59.92 percent of the voting shares represented. The actions of the Management Board for the past fiscal year 2024 were approved with a total of more than 99 percent of the votes. The past fiscal year closed with net income of EUR 1.3 billion and thus with a profit for the first time. A net loss of EUR 4.6 billion was recorded in the 2023 fiscal year. The Supervisory Board was formally discharged with an approval ratio of over 99 percent. In the elections to the Supervisory Board, which were held as scheduled after four years on the capital side, all candidates standing for election were confirmed by the Annual Gerneral Meeting – the exact voting results are available here . At the subsequent constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board, Joe Kaeser was unanimously elected as its Chairman. Dr. Hubert Lienhard was also unanimously elected Lead Independent Director, whose powers were significantly strengthened by a resolution of the Supervisory Board on December 11, 2024. The Lead Independent Director is now a permanent member of the Presiding Committee and the Nomination Committee as well as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. In the run-up to the Annual General Meeting, some investors had expressed concerns about the independence of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, although he was never CEO of Siemens Energy AG and left the former parent company Siemens AG more than four years ago. The appointment and additional responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director will further strengthen the quality of corporate governance in the company. Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, an independent management consultant in the energy sector and decarbonization of industry, and Dr. Feiyu Xu, Managing Director of Amber Iris AI Consulting GmbH, who is to represent the topic of artificial intelligence more strongly, were newly elected to the Supervisory Board. Ms. Dotzenrath received 99.77 percent and Ms. Xu received 98.16 percent of the votes at the Annual General Meeting. Dr. Christine Maria Bortenlänger and Hildegard Müller will leave the Supervisory Board as planned. Joe Kaeser, Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Chairman of the Annual General Meeting, emphasized: "Today's Annual General’s Meeting has shown that our shareholders are convinced of the operational strength and strategic direction of Siemens Energy. The confidence in the Managing Board under the leadership of Christian Bruch has been confidently confirmed. The structure of the Lead Independent Director function is unique in the German DAX and sends a clear signal to strengthen corporate governance in Germany. I look forward to working with the newly elected Supervisory Board and would like to thank the two departing members Christine Bortenlänger and Hildegard Müller for their valuable contributions over the past four years." The next Annual General Meeting of Siemens Energy AG will take place on February 26, 2026, as an in-person event in Berlin. You can find the full press release here . Siemens Energy Q1 FY25 Earnings Release - February 12, 2025 Strong start to the year – capitalizing on favorable market trends “Our strong first quarter reflects the market opportunities arising from the increasing demand for electricity. The strong cash flow was mainly driven by growth across all our businesses, advance payments and timing effects. Our focus lies still on profitable topline growth and technological leadership”, says Christian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy AG. Siemens Energy got off to a strong start to this new fiscal year. Demand for our products remained favorable and the strong order trends continued. The prior-year quarter’s figures for revenue, Profit before Special items and cash flow were clearly exceeded. All seg-ments contributed to the improvements. Orders of Siemens Energy amounted to €13.7bn. As expected, this was below the high level of the prior-year quarter, in which Grid Technologies and Transformation of Industry had booked exceptionally high orders. Book-to-bill ratio (ratio of orders to revenue) was 1.53, leading to a record order backlog of €131bn. Revenue of €8.9bn increased by 18.4% on a comparable basis (excluding currency translation and portfolio effects) with all segments recording growth. Profit before Special items of Siemens Energy more than doubled year-over-year to €481m (Q1 FY 2024: €208m) again held back by results of Siemens Gamesa, but to a significantly lesser extent than in the prior-year quarter. Special items amounted to negative €18m (Q1 FY 2024: positive €1,670m, in connection with disposals). Siemens Energy's Profit came in at €463m (Q1 FY 2024: €1,878m). Net income was €252m (Q1 FY 2024: €1,582m). Corresponding basic earnings per share were €0.23 (Q1 FY 2024: €1.79). Free cash flow pre tax was materially stronger than expected at positive €1,528m (Q1 FY 2024: negative €283m) driven by project advance payments and timing effects of customer payments. All segments contributed to the improvement. Based on the development in the first quarter, management now expects that Siemens Energy will exceed the current Free cash flow pre tax guidance of up to €1bn and therefore intends to update the Free cash flow pre tax outlook for fiscal year 2025 with the half-year results for fiscal year 2025. Siemens Energy Q4 FY24 Earnings Release - November 12, 2024 Munich, Germany, November 13, 2024 – Siemens Energy today announced its preliminary results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 that ended September  30, 2024.

Our focus remains on profitable growth, supported by highly favorable market conditions. The new mid-term targets until fiscal year 2028 reflect our leading role in the energy transition”, says Christian Bruch, President and CEO of Siemens Energy AG.

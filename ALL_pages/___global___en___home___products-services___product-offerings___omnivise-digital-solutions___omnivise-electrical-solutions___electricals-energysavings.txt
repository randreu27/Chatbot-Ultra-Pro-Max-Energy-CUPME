Over two thirds of the plant's auxiliary power demand comes from electrical drive systems . About 30% of drive systems such as pumps and fans could be run more efficiently. More than 97% of the entire life-cycle costs result from the energy needed to operate them. This considerable savings potential is just waiting to be tapped. With our energy-saving solutions the energy efficiency of drive systems can be significantly optimized. Energy saving solutions in your hands Our initial focus is on drives that promise a short-term payback for upgrade costs. We concentrate on rotating equipment operating with inefficient mechanical controls (throttle, bypass, dampers, inlet vane control etc.), and through drive modernization we optimize the energy efficiency of the entire drive train by implementing innovative and high-quality variable-speed drive solutions (VSD) and energy-saving motors. Our solutions also feature measures like the recovery of decelerating energy during braking among others.

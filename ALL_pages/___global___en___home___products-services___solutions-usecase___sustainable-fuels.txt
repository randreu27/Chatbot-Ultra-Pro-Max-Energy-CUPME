Gas turbines, capable of rapid ramp-up and down, are ideal for balancing grids and ensuring reliable power supply. Using sustainable fuels enables significant to full decarbonization while leveraging existing infrastructure. This combination addresses the dual challenge of meeting growing energy demand and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, making it a cornerstone for the global transition to sustainable energy. Exploring sustainable alternative fuels: benefits and eco-friendly choices Sustainable fuels are alternatives to tradditional fossil fuels that can significantly reduce carbon emissions. These fuels can be derived from various sources, including renewable energy, biogenic materials, and processes that capture and utilize carbon dioxide. Sustainable primary fuels, including hydrogen, biofuels and hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia and methanol, provide a diverse portfolio of options for decarbonizing gas turbines and supporting the transition to a more sustainable energy future. Switching to alternative fuels reduces dependence on fossil fuels and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable fuels and gas turbines are key to meeting residual load demand, complementing renewables and achieving a fully decarbonized power system, making them essential to the global energy transition . Benefits for gas turbines running on sustainable fuels Sustainable fuels in conjunction with gas turbine technology offer several advantages: Reduced Carbon Emissions They help in significantly lowering greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional fossil fuels. Energy Security Utilizing locally available renewable resources reduces dependence on imported fuels. Easy to Retrofit Power plants can be easily converted to run on sustainable fuels, especially if already built with a retrofit in mind e.g. “H2 Ready”. Dispatchable Power and Heat Sustainable fuels can provide reliable and dispatchable power and heat, essential for balancing the intermittence of renewable energy sources. Combined Heat and Power Gas turbines in CHP plants can cogenerate heat efficiently, supporting e.g. heat pumps when renewable power is limited or forwarding temperatures are high. Grid Stability Services Gas turbines provide essential grid ancillary services, including reactive power, frequency and voltage control, grid inertia, short circuit power, and blackstart capability.

Abundant and versatile : Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and can be produced from various renewable resources. Wide application : economies of scale are expected to develop widely with an expanding hydrogen infrastructure for use as feedstock and fuel for industrial processes, transport and power generation. Challenges Storage and transport: Hydrogen requires a pipeline transport infrastructure and potentially underground cavern storage. Combustion characteristics: Hydrogen has a lower ignition energy and higher flame speed compared with natural gas, posing technical challenges for combustion systems. Ammonia: Efficient hydrogen carrier Ammonia is an efficient hydrogen carrier that can be easily liquefied and transported. It has a higher energy density than gaseous hydrogen and proven distribution logistics. Siemens Energy is actively researching ammonia combustion in gas turbines, both direct and cracked ammonia. Ammonia's potential as a carbon-free energy vector makes it a promising option for future energy systems. Benefits Energy density: Liquid ammonia has a higher energy density than gaseous hydrogen, making it practical for storage and transport. Established technology: Ammonia production and transport are well-established processes, with a proven safety record. Challenge Combustion characteristics: Ammonia has a lower flame speed and entails higher NOx emissions, posing technical challenges for combustion systems. Toxicity: Ammonia is toxic, requiring stringent safety measures to prevent exposure. Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO): Sustainable diesel alternative Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) is a renewable diesel alternative produced from vegetable waste oils and animal fats. Siemens Energy has successfully tested HVO in gas turbines, demonstrating its potential as a sustainable fuel. Benefits Sustainability: HVO offers significant greenhouse gas savings compared to conventional diesel, without competing for land needed to grow food. Storage stability: HVO is suitable for long-term storage, even in colder climates. Infrastructure compatibility: HVO can be used in existing diesel infrastructure with minimal modifications. It is a sustainable fuel for gas turbines, similar to conventional diesel. Challenge Feedstock availability: The availability of feedstocks for HVO production may be limited by competing demands. Methanol: Recycling carbon dioxide Methanol is another promising fuel for gas turbines. It can be produced from biomass (bio-methanol) or synthesized from green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide (e-methanol), making it a viable option for various applications, including power generation and marine propulsion. Siemens Energy has successfully tested turbines with smaller sizes and validated with promising results. Benefits Energy density: Liquid methanol has a higher energy density than gaseous hydrogen, making it practical for transport and storage. Diverse feedstock: Methanol can be produced from various sources, including sustainable hydrogen, biomass and waste, enhancing sustainability. Infrastructure compatibility: Methanol is compatible with existing storage tanks and pipelines. Challenge Carbon source: The sustainability of e-methanol depends on the source of carbon dioxide used in its production. Other biogenic fuels Other biogenic fuels like biogas, biomethane, biodiesels/ FAME , and ethanol offer alternatives to hydrogen for decarbonizing power generation. They often benefit from compatibility with existing infrastructure and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. However, challenges include limited storability (e.g., FAME degrades over time) and competition with food production for feedstocks like the ones used today for bioethanol production.

Sustainable gas turbine fuels are all fuels that produce very low or zero CO2 emissions, such as sustainable hydrogen (green, pink, blue, turquoise), its derivatives (e.g. e-ammonia, e-methanol) and 2nd generation biofuels, e.g. biogas, biomethane, hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO), bio-methanol and bio-ethanol. What are the most effective alternative fuels for gas turbines compared to fossil fuels? All low or zero carbon fuels that fall within the fuel specification of the gas turbine model can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from gas power plants compared to fossil fuels. While blue hydrogen (and its derivatives) and biogenic fuels typically show 65-90% GHG emission reductions, green hydrogen and its derivatives can achieve 95-100% reductions. How can gas turbines achieve carbon neutrality or be decarbonized? Gas turbines can achieve carbon neutrality in two different ways: By using carbon neutral fuels (such as hydrogen, hydrogen derivatives or biofuels) or by using natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS). What is the optimal or most cost-effective alternative fuel for gas turbines? The most suitable sustainable fuel for a gas turbine depends on local factors such as the expected operating regime of the power plant, the availability and cost of alternative fuels, which vary widely from one region to another. The optimal fuel will therefore always be a project-specific decision. Is it currently possible to run a gas turbine on biogenic fuels? Several biogenic fuels have already been qualified for use in Siemens Energy gas turbines: While all frames can run on biomethane, there are first frames approved for use with HVO100 and bio-methanol. As development continues, more biogenic and other alternative fuels will become available for the Siemens Energy gas turbine product portfolio.

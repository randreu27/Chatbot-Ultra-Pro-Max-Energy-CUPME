These mechanisms ensure that the compressor operates at the optimal level required by varying conditions, thereby conserving energy and reducing wear and tear. Reciprocating compressor valves Introducing the MAGNUM Plus valve: Setting the standard in flow, efficiency, and serviceability We are excited to unveil our MAGNUM TM Plus compressor valve, the latest product offering in our successful MAGNUM TM family of compressor valves.  Designed to enhance flow and reduce pressure drop backflow, it delivers exceptional efficiency and reliability. Watch the video below. Key Features: Improved flow and reduced pressure drop backflow Increased compressor efficiency and reduced horsepower consumption High reliability Easy maintenance with common parts and replaceable element cup design Versatile installation and service, ideal for remote and challenging conditions Suitable for: Lubed and non-lubed cylinder applications Sour-gas applications Compressors rotating speeds up to 1800 RPM Differential pressure up to 3000 psi / 207 bar Download flyer Valve performance and reliability is key to compressor performance. By paying careful attention to reliability in every aspect of the design, we’ve created a valve that in many applications can run more than 50 percent longer than other valves before needing service. We’ve proven it in thousands of hours of tests, many at high speeds and high temperatures, with a wide range of gases. Our engineers select the most appropriate valve based on their extensive experience as well as tools such as our Dynamic Valve Analysis (DVA) program. MAGNUM Valve PDF (371 KB) Download MAGNUM Hammerhead Valve PDF (1 MB) Download Variable capacity control systems Most compressors produce more capacity than needed to allow for process control. The excess capacity is typically recycled to the inlet of the compressor to meet demand. The energy required to recycle the excess capacity is wasted. Variable capacity control systems give operators the ability to adjust compressor capacity to demand, eliminating recycle. This reduces energy usage and operating costs.Variable capacity control devices are becoming more prevalent in the process market because of increased energy costs and the desire to save energy and related expenses whenever possible.

Easy combustor maintenance Burner modules can be easily accessed for maintenance, minimizing downtime and maximizing availability. Borescope ports Multiple borescope holes allow visual inspection of the engine’s interior without disassembly. Borescope inspections prevent unnecessary outages. Covering a wide Wobbe range The SGT-400 can burn a wide range of gases, including non-pipeline quality gaseous fuels and distillate liquid fuels, covering a Wobbe fuel range from approximately 50 MJ/m3 to 17.5 MJ/m3. This includes fuels available in LNG liquefaction plants, wellhead gas, minimally processed weak wellhead gas, coke oven gas, biogas from ethanol industry waste, or landfill gas. The engine has a hydrogen (H2) capability of up to 30 vol% with DLE burners or up to 65% with diffusion burners with unabated NOx emissions. Additionally, it offers true dual-fuel DLE capability with automatic changeover from primary to secondary fuel at any load. Robust combustion with high fuel flexibility To provide high fuel flexibility, the SGT-400 uses a robust can-annular combustion system with six reverse-flow tubular chambers and a high energy igniter in each combustor. Clean, flexible operation The SGT-400’s DLE combustor burns a great variety of gaseous and liquid fuels and features clean combustion with low emissions. Low emissions in a rugged industrial design The field-proven DLE combustor provides clean combustion with low emissions across a wide operating range in the SGT-400. It utilizes six reverse-flow tubular combustion chambers around a high-pressure casing, each capable of gas-only, liquid-only, or dual-fuel operation. The control system ensures smooth, automatic changeover of fuel across the power range. The DLE combustion system enables the turbine to comply with emission regulations even at lower operation loads down to 30%, with NOx emissions of ≤ 15 ppmvd (corrected to 15% O2 dry). Clean combustion for strict emissions compliance The SGT-400 DLE combustion system meets the most stringent NO x and CO emissions legislation. Lean premix of air and fuel for NOx limitation Since NO x emission increases exponentially with rising temperature, it is crucial to ensure that air and fuel are well mixed. The Siemens DLE combustion system uses a lean air-fuel premix with multiple fuel injection points to achieve low emissions over a wide load range.
